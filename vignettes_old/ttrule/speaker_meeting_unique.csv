"2";"MR. BERNANKE.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic recovery seems well entrenched, and domestic final demand continued strong, foreshadowing healthy growth in 2005.  I don’t see inflation risks as having changed materially in recent months.  In particular, labor costs have been remarkably subdued.  However, with the recovery no longer fragile, continued withdrawal of monetary accommodation at a measured pace remains the appropriate policy, in my view. Some have cited a possible slowdown in labor productivity growth as an upside risk for inflation on the grounds that slower productivity growth implies a more rapid rise in unit labor costs. While lower productivity does, of course, lead to higher unit labor costs, all else equal, the links between productivity growth and inflation, as well as the implications for policy, are actually quite February 1-2, 2005 102 of 177 First, it’s important to note that an assumption of slower productivity growth is already incorporated into the Greenbook forecast. The staff projects output per hour in the nonfarm business sector to rise at about a 1.7 percent annual rate in 2005, less than recent experience and about a percentage point below the profession’s consensus estimate of the long-run trend.  The projected slowdown reflects both cyclical factors and the assumption that there will be some giveback of the extraordinary recent gains. As productivity growth has surprised repeatedly on the upside for almost a decade now, I think the risks for the Greenbook productivity projections should be viewed as well balanced, at worst. The staff projects that the deceleration in the cyclical component of output per hour should have little effect on inflation but will instead lower profit margins.  And even though the expected slowdown in structural productivity growth will put upward pressure on prices, the staff expects the impact on inflation of that productivity slowdown to be offset by other factors like declining energy prices and a stabilization of the dollar. To summarize, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast shows that some slowing of productivity growth, at least, is not inconsistent with continued stable inflation.  The interesting question is: What will happen if productivity growth in 2005 comes in even lower than the 1.7 percent projected by the staff?  If firms view the resulting increase in the rate of growth of unit labor costs as more or less permanent, then historical experience suggests that these costs will be passed on to consumers fairly quickly, thereby boosting inflation in the short run.  However, it does not follow that policy should therefore be tightened more aggressively.  The appropriate response depends also on the reaction of aggregate demand to this change in productivity growth. If a slowing in productivity growth occurs that is both perceived as permanent and is also largely unexpected by households and firms, then stock prices should fall and households should mark down their estimates of permanent income.  The resulting decline in aggregate demand will tend to offset the inflationary impacts of the productivity slowdown.  Also, because firms will expect February 1-2, 2005 103 of 177 illustrated in chart 6 of the Bluebook, the optimal policy response to a permanent slowdown in productivity growth may well involve a slower pace of tightening rather than a faster one, despite a possible short-run bump in inflation.  This scenario is just a mirror image of the post-1995 experience in which a perceived increase in secular productivity growth sparked a stock market boom and rapid growth in spending, and hence was not disinflationary, despite the fact that unit labor costs declined. What if productivity growth slows substantially but aggregate demand does not respond?  In that instance, unfortunately, we might be called upon to make a judgment about whether the slowdown is likely to prove temporary or permanent.  If it is temporary, then neither inflation nor policy should respond very much.  If the slowdown is judged to be permanent, however, the failure of aggregate demand to adjust would suggest that households and firms anticipated the slowdown, while the staff was too optimistic.  In this case, the slowdown in productivity should indeed be met with a tightening of policy in the short run. However, the funds rate should be lower in the long run, reflecting the fact that the neutral fed funds rate will also be lower.  This scenario is the mirror image of the 2002-2003 period in which productivity gains created disinflationary pressures that did require aggressive easing in the short run. To summarize, slower productivity growth does not necessarily require a tighter policy. First, some slowing is already anticipated and incorporated into the Greenbook forecast.  Second, if a significant slowing occurs, the key issue is the extent to which aggregate demand responds to the slowdown. A sufficiently large decline in aggregate demand might well reverse the presumption that tighter policy is needed when unit labor costs rise. Thank you."
"3";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy, to me at least, seems to be safely at what I would describe as a mid-cycle sweet spot, with inflation generally contained and growth at about potential. The staff’s outlook and the consensus forecast—the Greenbook baseline and the central tendencies on chart 15—were all consistent with that kind of benign outlook going February 1-2, 2005 115 of 177 While fourth-quarter GDP may have been mildly below expectations—due to the vagaries of national statistical authorities in other countries perhaps—the underlying growth of domestic demand in the most recent release was, I would say, relatively encouraging.  Final sales to domestic purchasers, the broadest measure of domestic demand excluding inventory investment, grew at a solid 4.3 percent pace, which I think Tom Hoenig already pointed out.  Both PCE expenditures and E&S expenditures contributed. Importantly, the private sector contributed almost all of the growth, as government consumption rose less than 1 percent and contributed less than 0.2 percentage point to the GDP growth, according to the most recent report.  This growth was supported by a number of underlying factors, all of which I think are consistent with the very positive outlook. Real disposable income managed an impressive 6.2 percent increase, even excluding the Microsoft dividend.  I’m surprised that from the Twelfth District we didn’t hear more about the dividend, since most of the recipients apparently live in Washington State. Orders and shipments of durable goods excluding aircraft rose briskly in December, perhaps undercutting to some degree the staff’s pothole outlook but reinforcing a general sense of balanced growth. Weekly jobless claims edged up most recently but still remain below the recent trend. Consumer confidence and business confidence surveys are all off a bit, but, again, for the most part the gains in the last few months are being maintained.  And our own survey of capital spending plans reinforces the notion of gradual business expansion. So, against this relatively benign mid-cycle backdrop and the number of data sources that suggest a continuation of this outlook, should we adopt a “What, me worry?” attitude?  Here is what differentiates us, perhaps, from some of Governor Olson’s contacts: We, indeed, are in it mainly for the pain!  [Laughter] But what are the things that should be causing us some pain as we look forward?  First and foremost, the drag from net exports appears likely to continue and, I would say, is disturbingly stubborn. Even after the glitch in the statistics from Canada has been taken into consideration, the February 1-2, 2005 116 of 177 year, well above the Q3 average of $51.8 billion. Given the amount of dollar depreciation that we’ve already experienced, why have we not seen a more balanced net export picture? I think we fully understand that this is a phenomenon that is due to a number of factors.  One is the relative strength of the growth in the U.S. economy versus the rest of the world—the Houthakker-Magee effect. The initial imbalance between imports and exports, as Karen has pointed out, means that exports have an awfully long way to run just to catch up with imports.  And there is the rise in oil prices. Another reason that imports appear to be relatively exchange-rate inelastic may be the limited pass-through, which fell from about 0.5 in the decade of the 1980s to about 0.1 in the decade of the 1990s. Some also believe the fact that the recent dollar depreciation has been against some currencies and not others may explain the size of the trade deficit.  But I suspect our staff is not in sympathy with that particular argument. In focusing on chart 14, though, what stands out is the degree of dollar depreciation that is called for just to get a very, very small change in the baseline—to try to offset even a little bit of the trade imbalance.  I think that is really quite disturbing for a number of reasons.  One is that I don’t have as much confidence perhaps as others do that domestic demand overseas is going to be stimulated.  The Japanese have a very severe problem to deal with.  The Europeans, as I meet with them, continue to discuss a very low potential growth rate and the need for structural changes.  The ECB, for a variety of perhaps legitimate reasons, I think feels quite constrained about trying to stimulate domestic demand.  So, I think the domestic demand situation externally is not particularly attractive. We’ve already talked about, in Karen’s response to Governor Gramlich, issues relating to the high-tech sector, where I at least see some questions, as Larry alluded to in his remarks.  So, I sense that the position with respect to the drag from exports is likely to be with us for a long time, is unlikely to change very quickly, and will probably require much more dollar depreciation than is built into the staff forecast, even in the alternative simulation.  Therefore, I think that’s an issue that February 1-2, 2005 117 of 177 The other risk that I think one should be focused on is an upside risk having to do with the pace of growth in unit labor costs. That has quickened recently, rising at a progressively faster rate over the four quarters of last year and leading to a slowing in the growth of unit profits.  Should businesses try to reassert the more rapid growth in unit profits that we saw earlier, they will need to attempt to raise prices.  The “flat markup and higher compensation inflation” scenario has, to my mind, a small but nonzero probability of happening.  The ratio of nonfinancial corporate profits to GDP has risen about 5 percentage points and now stands at about 11 percent.  The staff forecasts that the profit share will fall off a bit, and, I must say, history does support that forecast.  In five of the previous seven cycles since 1960, the profit share also rose above 5 percentage points—as it has now—and then did come off, as the staff has forecasted for the current cycle.  However, there is a little worry in all this, because in the last cycle the profit share reached about 13 percent of GDP before falling. If businesses now condition their expectations on that most recent experience, then the scattered stories of the exercise of pricing power that we’ve heard around the table could potentially become more widespread.  Whether or not that actually will occur depends on a number of factors that have been discussed already, having to do with competitive forces both in labor markets and in output markets.  Issues having to do with slack and with import prices clearly come into play here. At this stage, I’d say that all of this is clearly worth watching. These are the worries of central bankers, if not politicians.  Whether any of these risks or some other ones not named will come to pass obviously will be the subject of this year’s meetings.  Until that time, I think we should continue to execute our planned strategy of a gradual removal of policy accommodation, but review it really quite seriously at each meeting.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
"4";"MR. GRAMLICH.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" You got to be first in something!  [Laughter],  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This has been a quiet month in Lake Wobegon.  The growth of aggregate demand has been good and the growth of output reasonably good, though we would all feel better with more growth in exports and in import-competing sectors. Core inflation keeps bouncing along well within at least my target range.  And I am, in general, in sympathy with those who have been arguing for NAIRU on the lower side.  Our measured pace of changing policy has worked well in getting rates off the floor without seeming to hurt the expansion, and there is no apparent reason to change that policy at this meeting. To me, the real problem is the one that I spoke about last time, and the one that many other Committee members have mentioned today in different ways—low national saving.  The U.S. national saving rate is now at a post-World War II low, the combination of steadily falling personal saving rates and the recent budget deficits. The staff thinks, and I believe President Santomero does, too, that personal saving rates will rise, and the Chairman thinks that budget deficits will fall.  I’m a bit skeptical about both claims, but we will see. This week, the CBO added some new and sobering information on the budget deficit forecast. Assuming that there is added spending for Iraq, that the tax cuts are extended, and that the AMT [alternative minimum tax] is indexed implies the continuation of large-scale deficits through 2015, with the debt/GDP ratio climbing back to about 45 percent by that time—close to as high as it was at its local peak in the early 1990s, though not at the all-time peak that was achieved back in World War II.  We’re not careening out of control in these forecasts, but we could certainly do better February 1-2, 2005 121 of 177 Low national saving means either that investment will fall or that international borrowing must continue.  Problems with falling investment are well known, and we have discussed them often. Problems with the continued borrowing are much less well understood.  The staff recently wrote us a memo about adjustments to prolonged international borrowing in other countries.  The data underlying the report indicate no instances of more than four or five years of continued borrowing on the trade account; the trade account is the deficit that should, and in their data almost always does, determine the ratio of international liabilities to U.S. GDP. Our trade account borrowing has already gone on three times as long as any other borrowing episode for high-income countries and, in Karen’s forecast, keeps rolling right along.  There can be both a bad and a good explanation for the phenomenon.  The bad one is the well-known codependency thesis: We are over-consuming and other countries are inappropriately supporting their export industry by intervening to strengthen the dollar. The good explanation is that other countries have populations aging even more rapidly than ours and need a good place to invest their savings—given our strong productivity advance, we’re the place.  This benign explanation may well be correct, but it does have limited duration.  When the older workers in these countries actually retire, they will start to run down their saving and pull their funds back. At that point, our investment rates would seem to have to fall.  How long this international borrowing can go on is a deep dark mystery, but one thing is clear:  As a nation, we would be better off if we could manage to save more and finance our own capital investment.  We could do that by gradually tightening our budget while other countries expanded their economies. Back to monetary policy, we usually analyze it in a Taylor rule type of framework, comparing inflation and unemployment.  We could also go back to an earlier IS/LM framework, which is appropriate when prices are stable, as I think they are at least roughly. When and if we get my desired fiscal tightening, I’d be glad either to slide down or shift down the LM curve and move to lower funds rates as may be appropriate and necessary to keep the U.S. economy near full February 1-2, 2005 122 of 177 of any real fiscal austerity on the horizon than I did at the last meeting.  Hence, for one more month, I’m on the “measured pace” bandwagon."
"5";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As was the case at the time of our last meeting, I think we should be pleased with the way things are unfolding.  Output continues to expand at a good February 1-2, 2005 94 of 177 spending, we’re getting sufficient job creation to at least gradually push unemployment lower, and inflation remains at a low level. What we’re seeing in our Southeast region certainly confirms and helps to explain the favorable picture we see at the national level.  Most of the key sectors of our regional economy, including consumer spending, housing, manufacturing, retail, tourism, and auto sales, remain positive. We found it encouraging that a large share of investment spending by businesses was reported to be attributable to the anticipation of increased sales.  Other planned investment spending is being attributed to a desire to upgrade technology and to continue to improve competitiveness and cost efficiency. Consumer spending in our region continues to be strong.  Tourism has been especially positive. Florida theme parks are once again full to capacity, hotel bookings are up, and hotel room tax collections are 8 percent ahead of year-ago levels.  Housing growth in our region has eased a bit, though it still remains at a high level. The good pace of overall activity has contributed to new regional job creation. While having slowed somewhat in December, job creation has been sufficient to move ahead of the peak experienced just before the onset of the recession.  Our District added some 264,000 jobs last year, an increase of 1.4 percent. Florida led the District, creating 172,000 new jobs.  Since the end of the recession, Florida has accounted for 27 percent of the net new jobs created in the entire country. The District unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent as of the end of December, remains below that of the nation. Finally, I continue to be watchful for imbalances and their implications for inflation.  At our last board meeting, our directors provided additional reports of continued sharp run-ups in housing prices in selected areas, especially in some Florida real estate markets.  One director who manages a large trucking firm noted that equipment shortages in trucking are leading to frequent price increases. She reported that fuel surcharges are also being readily passed on and that rationing of February 1-2, 2005 95 of 177 commented that railroads are beginning to decline to renew some contracts to ship certain bulk chemicals, which are less profitable than containers and piggyback loads. As for policy, nothing in the data from either our region or at the national level suggests to me that we need to change the path that current policy is on in terms of either speeding up or slowing down the pace with which we’re removing the substantial accommodation that remains. Markets are expecting further moves.  And our models are suggesting that even with several more increases in our fed funds target rate, the real economy should expand between 3½ to almost 4 percent next year. That modeling work suggests that unemployment should continue to edge down and that the CPI should average between 2½ and 3 percent. Of course, the risks to these forecasts that people have already talked about are not insignificant. But I’m comfortable with the path we’re on, at least for now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"6";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For the economy, growth currently remains above trend and, as we all know, is likely to remain above trend several quarters forward.  As a result, we are systematically approaching long-run potential GDP for the economy.  I expect growth will be near 4 percent this year—above trend. There are obvious reasons for this: monetary policy remains accommodative, consumer spending on goods and housing is strong, and business equipment spending is strong.  While fourth-quarter growth was below expectations, final sales to domestic purchasers were at a robust 4.3 percent pace.  And I think the labor market continues to improve. Evidence from our District is very much in line with this outlook.  Most retailers we contacted said that holiday sales were moderately higher than a year ago, and many said that sales were above their plan. In addition, many ski resorts in our region reported sharp increases in hotel occupancy and a near-record volume of ski visits, many from foreigners.  Job growth picked up in December.  Hiring announcements since the last FOMC meeting exceeded layoff announcements by a margin of two to one, and a substantial fraction of small and midsized manufacturers said that they plan to increase employment in the coming months.  District manufacturing continues to expand at a brisk pace; production, new orders, and employment all rose in December, and firms remained upbeat about future activity. Capital spending plans for 2005 are reported strong. We all know where the price indexes are right now but, looking to the future, I would expect to see further increases in core inflation. With the federal funds rate below the lower bound of most estimates for the neutral rate, I remain alert to the greater or increasing risk of inflation.  In addition, there are several other reasons to think that this upside risk may be rising.  First of all, as others have said here today, we are hearing more about the return to pricing power.  Further, a greater pass- through of higher commodity prices seems to be occurring.  The possibility of continued dollar depreciation is strong, as is a greater pass-through of higher import prices.  And slowing productivity February 1-2, 2005 101 of 177 Evidence from the District supports these observations.  For example, the fraction of businesses reporting labor shortages was 53 percent in January, up significantly from last quarter and last year. As a result, wage pressures in the District have also increased.  About 26 percent of the employers contacted in January said that they had to boost wages more than normal as compared to 17 percent last quarter and 11 percent a year ago. In addition, our manufacturing survey showed evidence of greater pricing power. For example, among respondents reporting higher input prices, the share who also reported higher output prices has risen markedly, from 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 to 60 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, the same as before the recession. Similarly, among those who expect to pay higher input prices going forward, those who also expect to charge higher output prices has risen markedly from 41 to 51 percent. In summary, the outlook for the nation and our region is certainly good.  Growth is robust, and we are hearing increasingly that there is a lot of money looking for opportunity.  I would submit that the risk of higher inflation, therefore, is now large enough that we should at least be thinking about raising rates more aggressively toward neutral than we have in the past.  Thank you."
"7";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast for economic activity in 2005 and 2006, like the rest of yours, was for growth a little faster than the trend rate of growth in potential. That reflects my judgment that the forces that had been holding back the economy in recent years have largely dissipated, allowing the effect of relatively stimulative financial conditions to continue to show through and raising the level of production relative to potential. My projection for growth in 2005 and 2006 is in line with the rate of growth in 2004. Yet energy prices, whose rise must have damped growth to some degree in 2004, are expected to be flat or somewhat lower.  In addition, financial conditions have eased since the middle of the year, with bond rates and the exchange rate lower and stock prices a little higher. So, as I thought about my projection, the logical question seemed to be whether we were on the verge of a much stronger pace of economic growth.  Although that’s a possibility, I see several factors that should keep growth to a moderate pace.  Monetary policy and fiscal policy are at the top of the list. On the fiscal side, the partial-expensing provisions probably brought forward some capital expenditures from 2005 to 2004. For monetary policy, I assumed a continued gradual withdrawal of monetary stimulus along the lines built into the staff’s forecast or the market’s.  That should lead to rising real intermediate- February 1-2, 2005 106 of 177 investment spending directly, take something off the increase in house and equity prices—holding down gains in wealth—and support the dollar. Of course, that hasn’t been the experience over the last six months or so, as President Lacker just pointed out.  But longer-term real rates have fallen to such a low level that I find it difficult to believe they won’t rise from here, provided moderate growth is sustained. Indeed, I see an important downside risk to the forecast from the possibility of a sizable jump in longer-term real interest rates, which could have a pretty serious effect on house prices and consumption if it results from an unwinding of special factors or from a revision of unreasonably low expectations rather than from an unexpectedly faster pace of economic activity. Until those rates ratchet higher, however, their low level, along with the basically sideways movement of equity prices since late last year, would seem to suggest that caution among savers and spenders has not dissipated entirely. At the very least, the behavior of bond yields and stock prices seems inconsistent to me with a new more ebullient attitude that would presage boom-like conditions. In addition, the behavior of the trade deficit is likely to be damping the growth of demand on U.S. resources for a while.  The staff forecast, which has net exports making a modest net negative contribution on average over the next two years, is itself premised on a pickup in foreign demand—a pickup we don’t yet see in the data.  This suggests to me another source of downside risk. Over the long haul, as people become more reluctant to send us growing proportions of their savings, the deficit will have to fall. That will put considerable pressure on productive capacity in the United States, but it’s not at all clear when that will begin to happen. Finally, in making my forecast of real growth, I took account of my serial forecast errors. I’ve been overpredicting growth since I got on the Committee, so I used a sophisticated algorithm to compensate for this propensity:  I decided what I really wanted to forecast and I took a little off! February 1-2, 2005 107 of 177 My projection for core PCE inflation for 2005 and 2006 that goes with this path of output is slightly higher than the staff forecast. I gave some weight to the market-based core PCE numbers, which have been running higher than the total core PCE, but that forecast remains below 2 percent, and it is stable at that level. For inflation, the question I wrestled with was: Why not further increases this year after the acceleration of 2004?  In that regard, the recent data from the last part of 2004 have been supportive, I think, of a stable inflation forecast. With these data, every broad index of core inflation—from GDP prices to the CPI to PCE—grew less rapidly in the second half of last year than in the first— and significantly less rapidly, by at least ½ percentage point. This pattern is not consistent with accelerating prices. It reinforces the hypothesis that a good portion of the pickup in core inflation in the first half of 2004 was attributable to special factors: a reversal of the unexplainable undershoot in inflation in 2003 and the pass-through of higher energy, commodity, and other import prices from late 2003 and early 2004.  At least in terms of energy prices—not imports, which are a big question mark—I think these upward pressures should not be a factor in 2005. In labor markets, increases in measures of compensation also slowed from the first half of the year to the second. Now, this is particularly noteworthy in that one might have expected the previous run-up in energy prices and the strength in productivity increases in recent years to put upward pressure on compensation gains.  As a consequence, I think I’m a little less concerned than some others of you that slack has already been absorbed.  I can only explain the recent pace of compensation data if appreciable slack is persisting in labor markets to balance these other upside pressures. In this environment, continued intense competitive conditions are likely to limit labor cost increases and the ability or willingness of firms to pass through shorter-term increases in unit labor costs into prices and thus risk market share. Finally, inflation came in lower in the second half of 2004 than I had expected.  My projection was at the low end of our collective central tendency, so most of you were a little higher February 1-2, 2005 108 of 177 decline in the unemployment rate.  But energy and import prices rose more than I had anticipated. Consequently, I also wondered whether at midyear I had given enough weight to the factors restraining inflation—slack, elevated markups, and stable inflation expectations.  To be sure, slack should be diminishing, businesses will try to resist any squeeze on markups, and the economy may be closer to potential than it appears right now. If the dollar declines substantially, import prices will increase, reducing foreign competitive pressure.  Or if trend productivity slows more than projected, firms could be more insistent and more successful in passing through costs than is consistent with keeping inflation in check.  Still, for now, I think low, stable inflation is the most likely outcome for the next few years, provided policy continues gradually to firm, as slack slowly diminishes and output grows at a moderate pace. As for the balance of risks, I’ve always thought that that phrase applies primarily, or first and foremost, to the most likely path for inflation and output relative to our objectives at the assumed path for policy. And, in that context, the risks still seem to me to be balanced.  The fact that I found myself asking these particular questions about the outlook suggests, perhaps, a slight skew to the distribution around these modal outcomes.  But I think we should await further developments to assess whether those skews will become large enough to influence the central tendencies, the balance of risks, and the path on which we remove policy accommodation, or whether, as the market and the staff expect, we actually will need to slow the pace of tightening in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"8";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic growth in the Fifth District has been a little stronger in recent weeks. Retail revenues seem to have picked up.  According to our survey, seasonally adjusted shopper traffic was stronger in January than in December, and big-ticket sales February 1-2, 2005 104 of 177 continues to be brisk. District manufacturing activity generally firmed in January, following some softness in December.  And although our survey showed manufacturing shipments down somewhat recently, new orders strengthened and factory hiring was higher. In labor markets, we’re seeing some indications of a pickup in job growth in recent weeks. Data for December had shown only modest gains in our area.  Business contacts reported that prices rose at a somewhat quicker pace in January than in December, though increases for final goods and services were generally less than 2 percent. We continue to hear of sharp increases in prices for some categories of raw materials.  Some District manufacturers indicate that higher costs are squeezing their margins, but an increasing number of producers indicate that they are passing through cost increases by raising their prices. Pass-throughs are easier, some say, because raw material prices are affecting their competitors as well, though it isn’t clear why this wasn’t true with the earlier cost increases. Other contacts note that the stronger economic outlook makes their customers less resistant to higher prices, and this sounds a bit more persuasive to us. Turning to the national picture, the data we’ve received since the December FOMC meeting suggest that the recovery is on track. The forecast for inflation and economic activity in this Greenbook is little changed from December, and I haven’t seen anything that contradicts that view. In particular, core PCE inflation is projected to remain around 1½ percent, inflation expectations appear to be contained, and the Greenbook continues to project a healthy real GDP growth of between 3½ to 4 percent over the next two years as the output gap gradually closes. To my mind, the most intriguing development since December is the flattening of the yield curve. Despite a 26 basis point increase in the two-year Treasury rate since the December FOMC meeting, the 10-year rate barely moved and the 30-year rate actually declined by 17 basis points. This was clear in Dino’s charts yesterday. The behavior of the term structure is just what one would expect if the public has confidence that we’re going to conduct monetary policy in a way to keep inflation premiums stable and, thus, keep long-term interest rates low over the long run.  The fact February 1-2, 2005 105 of 177 supports this interpretation. I read these facts as evidence of the credibility of our low-inflation commitment, as was commented on at length yesterday. Of course, as we go forward, I think we’re going to have to watch the term structure carefully for evidence of emerging market concerns about either inflation or deflation.  For now, however, the yield curve evidence, together with overall economic conditions, suggests that the policy path we are assuming for this outlook is nicely balancing the upside and the downside risks."
"9";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The story from the Seventh District is much the same as last time.  We’re seeing a broad-based improvement in business conditions.  I would characterize it as solid growth, but not spectacular. Most of the sectors that were strong last year February 1-2, 2005 84 of 177 construction machinery, and commercial printing.  A number of firms in these industries have been able to raise prices without seeing a reduction in their order backlogs. We’ve also heard some upbeat forward-looking reports on commercial aircraft. And agriculture has been very strong. Farm incomes were up sharply last year, and that has been supporting big gains in the sale of agricultural equipment.  We also saw the largest annual increase in District farmland values in 15 years. On the other hand, the outlook for the Big Three automakers, whose operations and those of their suppliers are heavily concentrated in our District, is not so good.  Most analysts expect light vehicle sales to be similar to last year, but the Big Three are concerned about losing even more market share.  And their profit outlook is not good; we continue to hear that they have significant cost disadvantages relative to the transplants. Moreover, foreign nameplates have built out their product lines to the point where the Big Three face stiff competition in just about every market segment.  One result of the relatively poor performance of the Big Three is that Michigan now has the highest unemployment rate in the nation.,   Actually, Illinois is leading the Big Ten in basketball.  [Laughter] They are undefeated so far. On the price front, there’s more talk that higher costs for plastics and other energy-related inputs are working their way downstream, but we’re certainly not hearing widespread reports of major price increases. With regard to labor markets, the two large temporary staffing firms that we speak with regularly continue to report roughly 10 percent overall growth relative to a year ago, with demand for skilled workers rising fastest. Like us, they have been expecting a period of more robust employment growth.  But the further we get from the recession, the more they are becoming resigned to the idea that the growth rates we’ve seen over the last year may be as high as we’ll get in this cycle. The president of one of the temp firms made an interesting observation about the February 1-2, 2005 85 of 177 reasons are industry-specific.” This is an improvement from a year or so ago when many firms reported being worried about the strength of the overall economy.  His observations pretty much match my impressions.  Things aren’t exactly roaring, but few businesses regard the expansion as fragile. Turning to the national outlook, once again the data we’ve received since the last meeting have not materially changed our outlook for 2005.  We continue to expect that output will expand at a rate somewhat above potential and that there will be little change in core inflation.  I think the alternative simulations in the Greenbook did a good job of laying out a number of the risks to the forecast. Overall, I think these risks are balanced. The “higher long-term interest rates” simulation did give me some pause, especially because of the talk that foreign investors may be revising their thinking about U.S. securities.  But I remain concerned about another risk that we talked about last time, namely, that, instead of some appreciable slack remaining in the economy, we may already be essentially at potential or approaching potential. This view was raised by some of the participants, albeit a minority, in the meeting we had last week of our academic advisors and Chicago-area business economists.  When asked about the course of policy going forward, there was a roughly even split between those who thought that the path implicit in futures markets was about right and those who thought we should be raising rates at a faster pace. My own view is that we will probably have to raise rates this year to levels that are higher than those expected by futures markets.  As we all know, we will face communication challenges as the year proceeds.  It’s probably not critical today, but it will become more so as we move through the year."
"10";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I would like to reflect briefly on one of the charts in the chart show—the chart on E&S [equipment and software] expenditures—and the possibility of the “no investment pothole” scenario.  It strikes me that at this point in early February, if we are not yet certain as to the impact of the partial-expensing provisions, there’s a strong indication that there is no pothole. I say that for this reason: In my experience, incentives attract capital, and significant incentives—such as the kind that would generate this sort of behavioral change—attract capital noisily. That means that we would pick up, either from the E&S manufacturers or from the lenders, some indication of the impact of the partial-expensing incentives. The fact that we have not suggests that we may not see a deceleration in E&S spending as a result of the expiration of the partial-expensing provisions. That may be a risk to the forecast, but it is a risk only to the accuracy of the forecast; it would not be an unwelcome development.  If you look at the February 1-2, 2005 113 of 177 unemployment are very positive, yet the impact on PCE prices is neutral.  So it seems to me that that is a very realistic alternative. Second, in following the comments by bankers in January after the release of fourth-quarter earnings reports, two themes came through.  One was that asset quality has peaked and can only decline, and the other was the highlighting of additional provisioning for loan losses both in the fourth quarter and potentially in 2005. So there was a suggestion of cyclicality to these developments that would at least merit a look at the relationship between asset quality and the impact it might have on the economy.  The question is whether or not there is anything going on that would jeopardize our forecast of growth above potential through 2006. Bill Treacy pulled together some information for me, and I’ve handed it out in a set of three charts showing nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and loan loss provisions as compared to real GDP growth since 1990.4  The loan data have been seasonally adjusted to comport with GDP data. For two of the three—nonperforming assets and net charge-offs—asset quality is a very reliable lagging indicator. The peaks of nonperforming assets and charge-offs followed the troughs of GDP by several months.  The same is not necessarily true with loan loss provisions.  However, the opposite is not true. Those data did not indicate that at an inflection point we had reached a time in the cycle that would suggest the economy was ready for a downturn.  In fact, loan loss provisioning, in many cases, will increase at the start of the cycle of loan growth again, for reasons that are known only to auditors and the SEC [Securities and Exchange Commission].  [Laughter] So the question is: Is there anything in the current analysis of asset quality that would suggest a risk to our current forecast? It seems that there is not. A third point that I would like to make that has not been discussed yet is the longer-term fiscal policy issue called Social Security reform.  In Washington, D.C., the decibel level on Social Security is strong. It’s about to get stronger, particularly after this evening when the President discusses it again in his State of the Union speech. The Washington Post this morning indicated that February 1-2, 2005 114 of 177 even though the Administration’s position is not yet out, the Democrats have already lined up sufficient votes in the Senate to keep the private accounts—or personal accounts, as they are now being called—from happening.  The question would be whether the personal/private accounts will continue to be the focus or whether can we move to a more rational, thoughtful consideration of options such as those outlined in The Wall Street Journal article featuring Governor Gramlich earlier in the week. It is unlikely that we are going to get that latter scenario. The personal investment accounts will continue to be the focus for an important reason.  The Republicans who are in favor see the personal accounts as transformational—transformational both in the role of government and in terms of what government can do for the wealth-building of individual private citizens.  They see the adjustments that can be made as painful.  And, as one of them told me recently, “We’re not in it just for the pain.” [Laughter] In other words, if the package of proposed changes has no personal/private accounts, there will be no Social Security reform.  Also, there’s a very short window. If it doesn’t happen in 2005, it’s likely that it will not happen. So, I think the President is staking a significant part of his reputation on achieving Social Security reform, and the focus will be on that issue. So, I think we should expect that to be a very high profile issue for the next several months. In summary, there’s certainly nothing, even with the “no pothole” alternative, that would suggest to me that we in any way should alter our current path of removing accommodation in the measured manner we have been doing.  Thank you."
"11";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When I talk to my business contacts, I try to let them, first of all, tell me what’s bothering them.  Sarbanes-Oxley and health care costs rise to the top of the hit parade there; that’s about all they really want to talk about. Certainly, Sarbanes-Oxley is causing a significant increase in accounting and audit budgets, and a lot of senior executive time is being devoted to it. Nevertheless, the costs associated with that legislation are not going to show up February 1-2, 2005 109 of 177 total outlays. So it’s a diversion and a nuisance—a pain in the neck for many people, including ourselves. When I tried to extract views by asking contacts if they were concerned about certain issues—for example, labor availability—the answer was typically “no.”  They feel labor is readily available except for occasional specialties, like auditing. [Laughter] The only group for which they really see a bit of tightening, I think, is IT [information technology] professionals.  But concern about labor availability is not general; it’s spotty. So if you’re opening a new retail store, you’d probably find several times over the applicants for the number of associate positions you have.  I got the same kind of reply about concerns regarding wages and labor costs generally. The one thing I have seen is a modest upward revision among my contacts in expectations for their companies.  A contact from a computer firm with a large international business reported that his company has revised upward somewhat their expectations for global growth.  From contacts in the package delivery business we heard reports of some orders for new aircraft.  They see continuing strong growth in the volume of traffic from Asia, so that’s leading to some expansion there. The overall impression I get is that things are very, very well balanced.  There are modest upward revisions in plans and expectations. I think the expansion is proceeding and is, in fact, unusually free of significant bottlenecks. Things seem to be working out in an extremely orderly way.  I don’t even have any minor quibbles with the staff outlook, but I would like to emphasize the following point, which comes from the fan charts depicting the forecast confidence intervals. I think the staff’s forecast is a very, very sound central tendency. But when I look at the table showing the confidence interval around the Greenbook forecast for real GDP this year, I see a point estimate of 3.9 percent and a confidence interval of 2.2 to 5.5 percent. Our life is going to look quite different if GDP growth is either 5.5 or 2.2 percent. But that is the sort of confidence interval that comes from the history of Greenbook forecast errors. So, I think it’s extremely important that we keep our minds open to various February 1-2, 2005 110 of 177 either side. Moreover, I think it’s important that we provide that message to the markets so that the markets don’t assume that we are locked into a particular path.  The path that we’re on makes a whole lot of sense given what we know now. But we don’t want to condition the market to think that we’re locked into that path independent of shocks and disturbances.  I’ve written down a list of various potential shocks and disturbances. We can all do that.  We’ve talked about some of them. The ones that will come and bite us probably will not be any of those that are on the list.  They’re probably going to be total surprises. Thank you."
"12";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand at a moderate pace, but there is some variation across the three states of our District. Leading indicators are signaling continued solid growth in New Jersey and Delaware but more modest growth in Pennsylvania.  Payroll employment in our states grew at a 1¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year, down from an unsustainably strong pace earlier in the year. Pennsylvania continues to have the slowest job growth and the highest unemployment rate among February 1-2, 2005 89 of 177 Our business outlook survey indicated a considerably slower pace of expansion in regional manufacturing in January.  The general activities, new orders, and shipment indexes all fell to their lowest levels in 18 months.  This is something to watch.  The deterioration is not just localized in Philadelphia. I note that New York’s manufacturing survey also weakened in January.  At the same time, it’s important to remember that these are just one-month readings, and other indicators in the January survey are less negative. For example, current and future employment indexes in our survey are near their highest levels in the current expansion. Turning to future capital spending in the District, we participated, as did the other Districts, in the Board staff’s survey.  Our results are quite similar to the results for the nation as reported in Larry Slifman’s memo.  On a related topic, all of these results—in addition to the comments from firms in our District over the past several months—suggest that the expiration of the partial- expensing provisions had a smaller impact on firms than is assumed in the baseline Greenbook forecast. Turning to our economic intelligence on other sectors, there appears to be little change. Consumers continue to spend at a moderate pace.  Holiday sales in the region generally met expectations for a good, if not spectacular, showing. As was true in the nation, sales of luxury items showed the strongest performance, with year-over-year current dollar gains greater than 10 percent. Most of the other retailers reported year-over-year increases of around 3 percent. As I reported last month, nonresidential construction in our region remains soft.  The office vacancy rate in the Philadelphia metropolitan region has remained at about 16.5 percent since the end of 2003, although we are seeing some net absorption over the past year.  The construction of two new office towers will increase available space significantly, by about 5 percent. Meanwhile, residential construction has remained healthy, but it is down from its peak.  House appreciation continues, especially on the New Jersey shore, where prices were up over 20 percent in the past year. In summary, the economic expansion continues at a moderate pace in the Third District, and February 1-2, 2005 90 of 177 My outlook for the nation is similar to that of the Greenbook, with real growth averaging about 3¾ percent over the next two years. Like the Greenbook, we expect consumer spending to expand at about that pace as well. This consumption forecast reflects our view that the current personal saving rate, despite its low level, is not likely to lead to a reduction in household spending. As we all know and as was mentioned here today, the personal saving rate averaged 1 percent last year. That compares to an average since 1959 of over 7 percent. There has been some concern expressed that consumers will hold back on their spending as we withdraw monetary stimulus, but a Philadelphia staff analysis casts considerable doubt on this outcome.  That study points out several factors that warrant our attention.  First, measured personal saving excludes some investments, such as investment in human capital and capital gains, therefore underestimating the true saving rate.  Second, our real-time data series show that personal saving rates have been revised upward systematically, tending to wipe out low measured saving rates in the past. Since 1965, the mean revision has been about 2½ percentage points.  Third, the permanent income hypothesis suggests that a low saving rate may signal expectations of faster future growth in labor income.  Moreover, there is no significant empirical evidence that a low saving rate forecasts slower consumption growth. While our forecasts are similar to the Greenbook’s with respect to consumer spending and total GDP, there are some key differences.  As I’ve already mentioned, we expect less of an effect from the expiring tax incentives on business investment.  So we see stronger growth there, and our pattern of growth is smoother than in the baseline forecast in the Greenbook.  We also anticipate a large depreciation in the dollar for reasons we talked about today; that discussion was helpful to me in understanding the Greenbook forecast. Thus, real net exports do not make much of a negative or positive contribution to growth over the next year in our forecast. Our larger depreciation of the dollar, coupled with less slack than in the Greenbook baseline, leaves us to project a slow rise in core PCE inflation over the forecast horizon to 1¾ percent for 2005 and 2 percent for 2006. This February 1-2, 2005 91 of 177 and our forecast are predicated on maintaining our strategy of gradually removing policy accommodation to bring policy back to a more neutral stance.  Nothing in the current conditions or in the economic outlook suggests that it’s time to revise that strategy. We are at a point in the cycle where I think it is particularly important that we remain vigilant and forward-looking with respect to inflation.  The recent acceleration in core CPI inflation means that it is no longer in the lower part of the acceptable range, in my view.  This acceleration has not been large, and it has not yet shown up in the core PCE inflation. Nonetheless, both oil prices and the dollar pose an upside inflation risk. Thus, it seems prudent for us to remain vigilant and to continue on our upward path for the funds rate."
"13";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you. The broad-based expansion in our District continues. Employment gains have been modest but persistent.  In talking to employers, the general impression I get is that they are finding labor availability to be ample, although occasionally they’ve expressed some concern about the shortage of particular skills.  At the same time, they have mentioned some February 1-2, 2005 97 of 177 recently have returned to running job fairs—something that we haven’t seen in recent years.  Outside the labor market, the manufacturing sector in our District is strong.  Housing continues to operate at a high level. Mining, energy, and agriculture, outside of the areas that were affected by drought, all had good years and appear to be in good shape. We recently queried some of our directors and other business leaders about inflation, particularly inflation over the past three months—essentially, the fourth quarter of last year.  The reports we got back were uniformly along the following lines:  There has been no detectable acceleration of inflation, and, if anything, there has been a diminution of inflationary pressures. As far as the national economy is concerned, my forecast is very close to the central tendency reported in the chart show. I took the tenor of the chart show to mean, as I thought about it, that there’s not really very much wrong with the economy at the moment—depending on the significance one might attach to the current account deficit.  Beyond that, it seems to me that inflationary expectations remain essentially very well anchored.  All of this suggests to me that the policy path we’ve been on is appropriate and that we should continue on that path."
"14";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To me, the forecasts presented in the Greenbook and the consensus forecast of those from the private sector paint a sound economic picture for 2005— February 1-2, 2005 118 of 177 I’m comfortable that the removal of policy accommodation at a measured pace that we’ve announced and have been implementing is supportive of this growth going forward.  As some of you have mentioned, given such a good forecast, the question that arises is: What should we be worrying about in this picture?  I’d like to mention two concerns that I’ve been focusing on lately. The first is the risk around inflation. This is not a huge risk, but when I look at the Greenbook projection compared to various private-sector forecasts, the Greenbook’s inflation forecast is at the lower end of the range of the Blue Chip forecasts. Hopefully, the Greenbook will be the right forecast on this, but the inflation numbers have shown a lot of volatility in the last two years. So in light of the recent volatility, even in the core measures of inflation, I think it’s important that we look carefully at incoming data every month and keep on top of what is happening to try to get a better understanding. The second concern has also been mentioned by a couple of you around the table, and that is the mystery of why long-term interest rates aren’t any higher than they are.  My personal forecast a year ago would never have had long-term interest rates at the levels at which they’ve been sitting. If I look at various aspects of this, in trying to understand it, I can explain some things.  For example, we know that corporations have been seeing record profit margins and, as a result, have been generating tremendous cash flow.  That means that corporations have been able to fund a large part of their investment in inventory buildup through internal funds, as opposed to going to banks or to the markets. We also have seen fewer accounting scandals, which generated a lot of the uncertainty that widened credit spreads in 2002. Those spreads have really come back down again as we’ve had relatively fewer shocks to market confidence.  We’ve also seen rating agencies worldwide reduce the number of downgrades relative to upgrades; so that has turned around, which is another good sign. And as Governor Olson mentioned, the bankers are very positive about current credit quality. But I would say again that we should recognize that we are probably at the sweet spot in that credit February 1-2, 2005 119 of 177 On the other hand, consumers have been borrowing like crazy, and they’ve been borrowing at the long end of the curve. In large part, this is a reflection of the fact that interest rates are historically low, and people are being very rational by locking in at long-term rates and borrowing all that they can. On net, though, we’ve seen that there’s been plenty of liquidity in the long market. So what could happen here if long rates do move up as we go forward?  I guess I worry primarily about what that could do in terms of business investment.  We know that there may be a narrowing in profit margins.  And cash flow has changed to some degree, in that companies are beginning to look more to the outside for credit, especially as merger activity picks up, and that could affect the relative demand for credit from corporations. On the household side, we’re seeing that consumers have used these low rates to support consumption.  They’ve done it through equity extractions as they refinance. They’ve also had the benefit of tremendously innovative mortgage products being offered by bankers and other lenders. For tax reasons, people want to borrow as much of their debt against their houses as they can, and lenders have accommodated them by innovations in ARMs [adjustable-rate mortgages] where borrowers can lock in a low rate for a period on the short end of the curve. But lenders have also offered interest-only loans and mortgages with very high loan-to-value ratios to provide more credit that is eligible for tax deductions.  If interest rates rise, will consumers begin to slow their use of credit and, if so, what does that mean for consumption in the forecast?  This is the issue I really want to focus on because, to me, consumers have been the mainstay of this whole economic cycle.  To the extent that there is a wealth effect of housing, this could be a concern if people begin to purchase houses at a slower pace or even if housing construction stays at a high level but doesn’t grow. We’ve seen several private-sector forecasts of flat house prices next year.  If suddenly the equity buildup and the net worth of households were to slow, that could have an impact for consumers. When we look at why the saving rate is so low today, we also have to look at the fact that the ratio of net worth to income is at record levels.  Consumers have not had to save out of current February 1-2, 2005 120 of 177 income almost entirely to current consumption.  But if net worth begins to stabilize and consumers are not able to increase cash flow through refinancings or home equity lines, that could slow the pace of consumer spending and result in less GDP growth than in the Greenbook forecast.  Thank you."
"15";"MS. HOLCOMB.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is only the third FOMC meeting that I’ve had the privilege of attending, and I cannot help but notice how much the U.S. economy has improved in that short time.  [Laughter],  I think luck has a lot to do with it. Following a pause in upward momentum last autumn, which may have reflected energy developments or election-related uncertainty, most economic indicators have firmed over the last few months.  Monthly job gains were healthy during the fourth quarter.  Durable goods orders showed good gains in November and December, and retail sales ended the year on a decidedly February 1-2, 2005 98 of 177 mortgage and corporate bond rates have edged lower, perhaps adding to the financial tailwinds driving the economy. With this information as a backdrop, I sat down with several Dallas Fed economists to prepare our set of economic projections for the coming two years.  All of us were confident that real GDP growth would fall in the 3½ to 4 percent range. Indeed, the point estimates that we sent in were extremely close to the Greenbook forecast.  The Dallas staff’s projections for the unemployment rate were also quite close to the Board staff’s outlook.  Where we differed was on the trajectory for the core inflation outlook. The Dallas economic staff suggests that core PCE inflation will rise to 1.8 percent this year and hold at that level in 2006. A few factors account for the difference. First, the Greenbook incorporates several assumptions that give rise to the benign inflation projections, namely, that domestic profit margins will continue to narrow, that foreign firms won’t try to rebuild their squeezed profit margins, and that benefit cost increases will remain moderate.  If we relax any of these assumptions, the risks are tilted toward higher inflation and more rapid output growth.  When we consider the results of the special Beige Book survey on capital investment plans, which confirmed that many companies are planning to increase their spending because of strong demand and emerging capacity constraints, the question arises of whether the capacity will come on line in time to relieve the inflationary pressures that have emerged in the last year.  It seems that too many assumptions must work out just right to get the low inflation envisioned in the Greenbook. As I said earlier, prior to yesterday I had only participated in two FOMC meetings.  As a highly interested observer as well as a participant, I observed a notable difference in these two meetings.  In November, the Committee was still focusing on headwinds confronting the economy, while in December the discussion had shifted to tailwinds.  I note this because basically the same thing has happened at the Dallas Fed’s board of directors meetings.  In November, the directors’ February 1-2, 2005 99 of 177 uniformly upbeat. At our January board meeting, the positive tone of the economic reports underscored and reinforced our view that a turnaround had occurred in mid-November. As of yet, however, most of the data available for the Eleventh District haven’t quite caught up with the anecdotes. Texas employment growth has strengthened but remains below that of the nation. The Texas unemployment rate ticked up in November and December and remains above the national rate. Almost all sectors of the Texas economy are gaining employment and the sluggish recovery is broad-based. Following a record-breaking year in 2003, 2004 turned out to be the best year ever for new and existing home sales in Texas.  Despite this good news, the Texas housing market likely has peaked but at a high level. Prices remain flat.  High inventories of existing homes and rising inventories of new homes caused builders to pull back on starts in the final months of 2004.  On a brighter note, office vacancy rates have finally begun to decline in the last few months, thereby confirming the anecdotes about an improving office-leasing picture that we began to hear last summer.  Hopefully, the economic statistics for the District will soon begin to reflect the recent reports from our directors, which noted an increasing willingness to hire and to make capital investments for badly needed capacity.  These reports also noted some increases in pricing power. In thinking about policy options, it seems that most of the inflation risks are on the upside. The “tech wreck” and geopolitical headwinds have died down. Over the last couple of months, the expansion has gained considerable momentum.  Core inflation rates have turned up, mainly reflecting that goods prices have stopped falling and are now on the rise. The Committee has raised the funds rate by 125 basis points since last June. These rate hikes have not pushed up real, let alone nominal, yields on corporate bonds and fixed-rate mortgages.  And there are risks that the dollar could fall further, adding to inflationary pressure.  As I mentioned before, pricing power seems to be increasing. All of these factors suggest that the expected course of policy is on the right track, with another 25 basis point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and expectations of continued February 1-2, 2005 100 of 177"
"16";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The New England economy seems to be growing at a slow but steady pace and weathering what so far has been a pretty snowy winter.  The basic data are pretty good. In all states of our region, except Massachusetts, employment has been growing steadily at about the pace of the nation as a whole.  Consumer and business confidence and spending are up. Manufacturers have a positive, though I wouldn’t say excited, perspective on 2005, and coincident and leading economic indexes suggest economic activity is expanding and will continue to grow over the next six months. Over the longer term, there are a couple of concerns I think are worth mentioning.  The first of these involves energy prices. Not surprisingly, given the weather and oil prices, fuel and utility costs in the Boston CPI region have risen at a rate of about 16 percent on an annual basis. This, however, looks like it might not be just a short-run effect but could involve higher energy costs over the longer term.  Indeed, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a recent report highlighted New England as at risk of energy shortages if extended and serious weather problems occur even this winter, or if they don’t, with some normal growth pattern over the next couple of years. Apparently, constraints related to natural gas—both the supply of and the ability to move natural February 1-2, 2005 92 of 177 made New England vulnerable to permanently higher energy costs or debilitating power outages. Neither of these would bode well for continuing rapid rates of growth in the region. Second, while jobs in Massachusetts declined in November and December and the rest of the region grew moderately, the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent, the lowest of all the census regions. The number of unemployed actually fell by 20 percent.  This is because New England was also the only part of the nation to experience a decline in the size of its labor force over the past year. Workers either are leaving New England and migrating to other parts of the country or dropping out of the work force, or both. Again, this won’t bode well as firms begin to look for people to hire on a broader scale than they may be doing now. Anecdotally, all of my contacts see cause for optimism in the current economy.  Last year was a good year and, for some industries, a great one.  So, many expect 2005 to show some moderation.  Contacts remain concerned about the geopolitical situation.  They’re concerned about fiscal and trade deficits, but it’s the impact of their continuing efforts to implement Sarbanes-Oxley financial controls that really worries at least some businesspeople.  Apparently, the intensive effort to implement all that is required and the costs in terms of fees paid to accountants and other consultants have been a matter of major concern. On the national economy, our forecast and that of the Greenbook continue to look very similar. In fact, the differences are so small now it’s not really worth talking about them.  As I see it, incoming data since the last meeting all suggest that the economy has a reasonable amount of forward momentum.  I’d like to see further confirmation of employment growth, but business investment, consumer spending, homebuilding, and motor vehicle production all indicate that the first part of 2005 could be even a little stronger than we anticipate, assuming the November trade deficit was a bit of an anomaly.  Inflation seems to have edged off, at least when you look at the core CPI. It is a percentage point higher on a year-over-year basis than it was a year ago, but that pace of change seems to be slowing; and certainly the core PCE has leveled off at 1½ percent or so. The February 1-2, 2005 93 of 177 becomes a bigger factor in supporting consumer spending, and business production, investment, and profit all remain pretty solid. So where are the risks?  Well, rising inflation could be one risk, as many commented at our last meeting.  There are good reasons, I think, to expect inflation and expectations of inflation to remain well behaved over the next year or so, but they are all based on the variety of ways we have of assessing what is not directly observable, and that’s the amount of slack in the economy.  These measures are credible and reliable, but it’s also wise to be cautious about how accurate they can be in an environment of expected solid growth.  Excess capacity could be used faster than we expect, or we could be starting with less of it. It’s hard to see evidence of this as yet.  So I viewed the Greenbook alternative that combines rising compensation costs and a flat markup as providing good food for thought on what the mechanics of an inflation surprise might look like. I also remain concerned about an increased risk of financial fragility.  The country’s trade deficit is alarmingly large, and overly expansive domestic economic conditions will only make that worse. Fiscal deficits that show signs of growing under reasonable estimates of near-term tax and spending initiatives could add to the mix.  Financial markets, as well, are very accommodative, despite some bounciness in equity markets, with narrowing credit spreads and abundant liquidity to bankroll large mergers and spur the ever-expanding hedge fund industry.  Low interest rates all by themselves certainly are not a problem.  But if you combine those rates with lots of liquidity, low risk premiums, and what consumers, investors, and businesses are incented to do as they reach for return, there could be a problem.  In my view, these risks all suggest that the process of returning policy to a less accommodative place is exactly right.  Thank you."
"17";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My District report will balance out President Guynn’s report, because economic conditions in the Fourth District have not changed very much since December.  As suggested by our Beige Book report, it appears that our region’s economy is still not advancing at quite the pace as the rest of the country. That said, most of my business contacts are cautiously optimistic that the country’s economy will see solid growth in 2005. In what might be a good sign for job creation, for the first time since I’ve been in this job I’m hearing less emphasis on productivity gains as an explanation for limited hiring. I am finally hearing some mention of staff additions, although they are focused in particular industries and are not widespread. These comments are consistent with GDP expansion in the 3½ to 4 percent range, modest gains in employment, and relatively robust capital spending, as contemplated in the Greenbook baseline projection. My directors and my other business contacts continue to comment on high input prices, especially prices of raw materials, and they comment on the desirability, or even necessity, of February 1-2, 2005 96 of 177 increases to their customers, although it remains difficult to quantify how much of this talk is feeding into retail prices. Nonetheless, from my perspective, the flat markup scenario that is reported in the Greenbook is a very important risk, even though I do believe that the baseline projection is the more likely scenario. We’ve just ended a year in which the realized rate of headline inflation was higher than I think is acceptable going forward. Of course, as has been mentioned, there were special pressures from the energy sector that contributed to that, and I share the opinion that those problems are probably behind us. And I am heartened that we have managed to emerge from the year without deterioration in the private sector’s inflation expectations.  Nonetheless, when asked what will turn out to be the biggest economic surprise in 2005, the Blue Chip forecasters put higher-than-expected inflation at the top of their list. I’d like to be sure that we don’t contribute to a continuation of last year’s price level performance by unintentionally setting the fed funds rate at a level that’s too low.  I do like the fact that we’ve been able to remove our accommodation at a measured pace in moving the fed funds rate back toward a more comfortable zone.  If we stop short in adjusting the fed funds rate now, we could find ourselves losing the ability to continue with the moderate steps that we’ve had the luxury of implementing so far.  Over the past few months, many of us have noted that what we ultimately want is to move the fed funds rate somewhere back to a neutral neighborhood.  Given the imprecision of this neutral concept, it’s a pretty big neighborhood, and I’d prefer not to be at the lower end of that range. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"18";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Twelfth District economy continues to expand, posting growth in line with that of the nation. Consumer spending remains strong, led by gains in travel, services, retail goods, and especially housing. Businesses have also been spending, February 1-2, 2005 86 of 177 The weaker dollar continues to benefit District exporters who report booming demand for their products. Although international trade volumes remain high, increased hiring and around-the­ clock work schedules have cleared out the backlog of ships at our ports.  Some bottlenecks remain in the ground transportation networks as a result of storms, mudslides, and infrastructure problems but these, too, are waning. Turning to the national economy, recent economic data have been encouraging, raising my confidence that the expansion has found a secure footing. The December employment report was by no means spectacular, but it strengthened the impression that the labor market has firmly established a pattern of moderate improvement.  In terms of the outlook for the real economy, I’m generally in agreement with the Greenbook.  But I think it’s important to emphasize that this forecast, which calls for growth only moderately above potential with a very gradual diminution of the remaining labor market slack, depends on a very gradual pace of monetary tightening.  The Greenbook incorporates only three more 25 basis point increases in the funds rate this year.  Moreover, even with this modest tightening, I consider the Greenbook optimistic in expecting longer-term interest rates to remain at their present levels.  In my judgment, the risk with respect to longer-term yields is asymmetric.  Should longer-term yields increase, growth could fall well short of the Greenbook projection, as shown in an alternative simulation. Turning to inflation, the data received since our December meeting, particularly the CPI and the ECI, have been favorable. The forecast for a rise of about 1½ percent in the core PCE price index in 2005 strikes me as very reasonable.  We’re all aware of the sources of risk in this outlook, including the future paths of the dollar and oil prices, the currently high markup of prices over unit labor costs, trend productivity growth, and, of course, the degree of slack left in the economy. In December I argued that the risks to inflation from productivity developments were reasonably well balanced. I hold roughly the same view on the risks emanating from labor market February 1-2, 2005 87 of 177 A considerable body of research—most conducted within the Federal Reserve System—has examined the possibility that the last recession and recovery were characterized by unusually large structural shifts, resulting in an exceptional degree of mismatch in the labor market.  If an unusually small fraction of the currently unemployed are qualified for existing or emerging job vacancies, the true degree of slack in the labor market is overstated by measured unemployment.  In effect, the NAIRU has risen. This possibility motivates one of the alternative simulations in the Greenbook. At the AEA [American Economic Association] meetings in Philadelphia last month, I chaired a session in which four teams of Fed economists subjected this structural-shifts hypothesis to close scrutiny. I emerged from this session a skeptic.  I see this recent research as casting considerable doubt on the hypothesis that the jobless recovery was a period of pronounced economic restructuring. In fact, the consensus of the session was that sectoral reallocation has probably been running at roughly normal levels for our dynamic economy. The finding of unusually large sectoral shifts is based on the behavior of several nontraditional measures of restructuring.  In contrast, such traditional measures as the dispersion in industry employment growth rates revealed the last recession and jobless recovery that followed to be a period of low, not high, sectoral reallocation.  The problem with traditional measures is that they may confound cyclical with sectoral changes.  The alternative restructuring measures, however, turn out not to be robust to minor changes in the time period studied and the methodology used. One sign that mismatch is not unusually high, at least during the recovery period, comes from data on job creation and job destruction.  In 2003, for example, total job reallocation—defined as the sum of job creation and destruction—stood at its lowest level in the last decade for which data are available. Another sign that mismatch is not especially high comes from the Beveridge curve relating unemployment and job vacancies.  A shifting out of the Beveridge curve, signaling higher levels of vacancies coexisting with any given level of unemployment, would provide evidence of increased mismatch.  Using a new measure of job vacancies that adjusts for well-known biases in February 1-2, 2005 88 of 177 If skill mismatch had intensified, we might also expect to see diverging unemployment rates and compensation paths for workers of different skills.  However, analysis by our staff shows that since the onset of the recession, the unemployment paths of less- and more-educated workers have been similar, and the change in compensation growth for lower-skilled occupations has been at least as rapid as for occupations requiring higher skills.  These findings align with reports from our contacts who tell us that for the most part they’re able to hire workers at all skill levels.  Even in markets where workers are harder to find, our contacts report little difference in hiring difficulty or compensation growth by skill. With respect to the introduction of labor-saving technologies, our sense is that such innovations are affecting the entire skill distribution. For example, reports from two of our contacts, a lawyer and a farmer, illustrate this point.  We were told that the law firm had replaced skilled legal workers with software designed to search for criminal evidence in e-mail files.  The farm introduced machinery that reduced the number of field workers needed to harvest row crops from 400 to 40. So, my bottom line is that I do not think the evidence supports the case that NAIRU has increased due to an unusual degree of mismatch in the job market. Turning finally to policy, I think it makes sense to remove a bit more accommodation at this meeting, but I do think we’re reaching a point where relatively soon we will need to begin to slow this process down."
"19";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050202meeting.csv";" We haven’t changed our view of the national outlook significantly since the last meeting.  Our forecast is quite close to the Greenbook in all components, and quite close, I think, to the central tendency of the rest of your forecasts. I don’t have anything material to report about the economy of the Second District that I think has relevance to the national outlook. On the assumption that monetary policy follows a path close to that now priced into markets, we expect growth to be above potential over the forecast period, at slightly above 3½ percent, with core PCE inflation staying around 1½ percent. We think the distribution of probabilities around that forecast is roughly balanced, and we have somewhat more confidence in our forecast this time than we did at the last FOMC meeting.  At the margin, we see less downside risk to the growth forecast than we have over the past few meetings. The resilience of the expansion in the face of recent shocks, the breadth of underlying strength in the main components of GDP except net exports, the fundamental sources that seem likely to underpin a continuation of recently strong consumer spending and investment, the survey- based measures of consumer and business confidence, the anecdotal reports of somewhat diminished business caution, and the moderate pace of the expansion so far all seem to add to the arguments in February 1-2, 2005 111 of 177 There is some talk among people who run major global corporations in New York about fragility remaining in the outlook, about a world of lower growth and higher volatility, about more lurches in the outlook for economic activity and asset prices.  But I think the overall tone is a bit more positive; it has become progressively more positive over the last few months. On the inflation outlook, we face diminished risk of a significant decline in inflation from current levels and somewhat higher risk of some acceleration of inflation from these moderate levels, although the recent news, of course, has been reassuring. As productivity growth slows, resource utilization increases, and unit labor costs accelerate, we lose some of the cushion that has supported what has been a very benign performance of inflation recently.  Profit margins are substantial enough to absorb significant acceleration in labor costs and other costs, but firms seem to be reporting increasing pricing power still. With the markets apparently confident that we will continue to move the fed funds rate closer to equilibrium—whatever that is—we’ve been successful in keeping inflation expectations stable at relatively low levels. This forecast, of course, looks implausibly benign.  It’s hard to imagine that the path of the economy between now and the end of 2006 will materialize as the consensus not just around this table but among private forecasts seems to envision.  The confidence around this view, which is evident in low credit spreads—low risk premia generally—and low expected volatility, leaves one, I think, somewhat uneasy.  The general reduction in fear and uncertainty that now prevails has the effect of making everything look better.  But, of, course it also may increase our vulnerability to some adverse shock and could magnify the effects of some types of shocks. The greatest risk to the forecast, I believe, involves this combination of very low risk premia with our large growing external imbalance, uncertainty about the prospects for a meaningful improvement in the fiscal baseline, and uncertainty about the sustainability of high structural productivity growth. Together, these factors increase the probability of some unwelcome surprise— some unwelcome shock to asset prices which, of course, could feed into a substantial slowdown in February 1-2, 2005 112 of 177 Obviously, it would not make sense for us to use our monetary policy signal to reintroduce more cautious risk premia and greater uncertainty.  But we probably need to be careful over time, to the extent that it is possible, to avoid doing things that reinforce an unhealthy degree of confidence in the future path of the fed funds rate or leave that path less responsive to changes in the data and the outlook. Monetary policy should, in my view, continue to be directed at moving the fed funds rate higher toward a level more comfortably in the range of equilibrium and at convincing markets that we will continue to move the funds rate higher at a pace determined by our evolving view of the outlook—that is, sufficiently fast to keep inflation expectations stable at low levels.  I don’t know whether that path will end up being steeper or softer than what is now priced into markets.  As we move today, I think the signal in our statement should try to be neutral to the expectations now prevailing about the near-term path of monetary policy.  Thank you."

[Laughter],  Governor Bernanke.,  Governor Gramlich.,  Governor Kohn.,  Governor Bies.,  Governor Olson.,  Thank you. Vincent."
"21";"MR. BERNANKE.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are experiencing a mini-inflation scare in financial markets—a development that we need to take very seriously.  The primary reason for the scare was the recent rapid increase in the prices of oil and other basic commodities.  Other determinants of inflation, it should be noted, seem to be largely under control. Still-strong productivity growth and subdued wage increases have been sufficient to induce some recent deceleration in unit labor costs.  At the sectoral level, recent increases in auto prices seem unlikely to continue, given the industry’s inventory overhang.  And I note that this morning’s report showed a 0.9 percent decline in February in auto prices. Prices of imported consumer goods have also been remarkably tame, rising about 1 percent in the year to January despite the fall in the dollar. And the influx of low-cost apparel imports associated with the end of the Multifiber Agreement should provide more help on that front.  Inflation in services is stable, and far future inflation compensation, which effectively strips out oil effects, has not risen. How serious is the inflation risk posed by rising commodity prices?  One view, which, if correct, would be quite worrisome, is that commodity prices are the canary in the coal mine— indicators of easy monetary policy and building inflationary pressure.  I don’t find this view persuasive, and I note that the academic literature has found essentially no support for it.  Instead, recent commodity price increases seem to be largely the result of economic developments unrelated to U.S. monetary policy, which I would call supply shocks, although without disagreeing with President Poole. What we’re saying here is that China is exogenous.  [Laughter] In the case of oil, for example, international agencies have recently revised downward their projections of non-OPEC March 22, 2005 57 of 116 likelihood that growth in demand this year will be disproportionately concentrated in energy- inefficient countries, such as China. The weak dollar, which I suspect is responding more to the current account situation than to monetary policy per se, is also affecting the oil price.  Since 2000, oil prices have risen 98 percent in dollar terms, but they have also risen by 45 percent even in euro terms and by 76 percent in yen terms. If the supply shock interpretation is correct, then the effects on core inflation of the recent run-up should be moderate.  As is well known, commodities and raw materials make up a small share of producers’ costs. For example, the staff estimates that even in a full employment situation, in which firms have some pricing power, a 1 percent increase in the core PPI for intermediate goods should result in less than a 5 basis point increase in the core CPI. By the way, I think that fact helps to reconcile to some extent the benign inflation numbers with the anecdotal reports of price increases, since many of them take place at the intermediate level. An interesting datum from last week’s survey of 22 primary dealers is that, on average, they expect core PCE inflation of 1.91 percent at an annual rate during the third quarter of this year, up only 6 basis points from what they expected for the same period as of the week before the last FOMC meeting. If we are, indeed, facing a supply shock, then to some extent the situation is analogous to where we were last spring when inflation pressures proved transitory and policy patience paid off. However, all economists have two hands.  And on my other hand, I agree that there are also important differences from the situation last spring.  The expansion has considerably more March 22, 2005 58 of 116 would not like to see it go much higher.  Finally, futures markets suggest that this time the shocks to commodity prices are expected to be relatively more permanent than they were last time. For these reasons, the risks to both the output and inflation objectives of a slightly more aggressive policy posture seem fairly modest.  My bottom line is that I support raising the funds rate by only 25 basis points today. However, I believe that it would behoove the Committee to modify the statement in a way that signals the possibility of stronger actions in the near future.  Thank you."
"22";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting, I described the economy as being in what I called a mid-cycle sweet spot, so the obvious question is: What has happened since then?  I would say that, in general, my headline is bifurcated.  One is, “so far so good;” and two is, “there are a number of caveats”. Let’s first look at the “so far so good” part of the headline. As all of you have already pointed out, the economy seems to be gaining momentum.  Households continue to be in good shape. The saving rate is, unfortunately, low, but that is supporting consumption.  Households are also being supported by an increase in compensation per hour that continues to look quite robust. As the Greenbook has pointed out, there seems to be no pothole on the investment side, so the business fixed investment component is also kicking in.  Nevertheless, as a number of you have already indicated, some concerns have arisen recently on the inflation front.  But I think we should also recognize that long-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  And importantly, while a number of costs have gone up, unit labor costs themselves continue to be, if anything, quite moderate.  All of this suggests to me—though I will point out some caveats—that the incoming data are not flashing a signal that we are clearly behind the curve. So what are the caveats that seem to be important?  Both of them deal with some uncertainties regarding the supply side of the economy.  First, we have a question about what is going on in the labor markets.  As all of you know, several meetings ago, and then at the AEA [American Economic Association], I put forth some relatively rudimentary analysis that suggested that some of the decline we’ve seen in labor force participation rates may not turn around very quickly. The staff has done some much more sophisticated analysis and has come to a not too March 22, 2005 62 of 116 increase in labor hours that can go into overall potential GDP. The staff has done that, and I support that conclusion. The second uncertainty with respect to the supply side has to do with productivity growth. This, I think, will be an ongoing question for us for some time to come.  I recognize—as do others, including President Yellen—and applaud the fact that there appear to be many positive signs with respect to productivity growth. We had a discussion in this room, for example, in a meeting with the SIA, suggesting that Moore’s Law continues to be in shape, which is obviously a very positive thing. And we have seen some upside surprises in income and productivity growth, which, again, is a very positive development. Having said all of that, the staff takes into consideration the net debt financing of financial firms and the financing gap information, both of which show that firms have a great deal of room left to invest; the staff views those as positive signs that there is some potential upside to productivity. I would say that we should at least be a little cautious in that assessment because those developments may involve some negative signs.  So I think there’s a little question mark on the capital deepening component of productivity increases.  At this stage, I’m generally willing to support the consensus that has emerged around the table, and in the Greenbook forecast, that productivity probably is in good shape. But we need to monitor that. Another caveat has to do with this issue of energy prices.  I, along with Governor Bernanke, realize that energy prices play a relatively small part in inflation in the U.S. economy, particularly against the backdrop of well-contained unit labor costs. However, like others, I recognize that the increases in oil prices seem to have had a dramatic impact on market psychology and may be the thing that could undermine the relatively well-contained inflation expectations that have been March 22, 2005 63 of 116 dynamics are such that not only are oil prices likely to be in a higher range, as indicated by the far- dated futures, but also that the surprises are more likely to be skewed to the upside.  In my view, the recent increases in oil prices reflect some real concerns that world supply will not be able to keep pace with demand growth, as a few of you have already said.  In particular, I think the cushion of spare production capacity has narrowed significantly. In preparation for this meeting, I asked the staff to do an options-derived probability density function of WTI prices.  I don’t have the results to hand out, but when one looks at the December 2005 function, there is a particularly large skew to the right-hand side. I think this is telling us that there are significant market concerns that prices could surge in the event of supply disruptions. These concerns have pushed up both futures prices—which to me can be interpreted as a mean expectation for future spot prices—and also spot prices today, reflecting, I think, some heightened precautionary motives for holding inventories.  So there is a real risk that with very low short-run price elasticity of demand, a supply shock could lead to very big moves in price and potentially unhinge the inflation expectations that we have benefited from.  So I think that is another caveat to worry about. Finally, President Geithner has raised a few times the question of whether or not the predictability of our language has been the source of a reduction in either implied volatilities or spreads over Treasuries. I had the staff do some basic historical charts to look at this issue.  We first introduced in the Chairman’s congressional testimony in 2003 the notion that we’d keep rates low for a considerable period, and that showed up in our press statement for the first time in August 2003. Since then, obviously, we’ve gone through other terms such as “patience,” “measured pace,” et cetera. All of that I think has played to some degree in the reduction of implied volatilities and March 22, 2005 64 of 116 implied volatilities and in the spreads over Treasuries, both started to decline many, many months before our original focus on using the kind of language we’ve been using. So while I don’t necessarily disagree that there are carry trades and that some real risks have emerged, in my view we should not take too much of the blame for that upon ourselves.  I think a number of market dynamics have driven that, along with predictability and transparency at the Fed. That leads me to the final point: What does all this mean for monetary policy?  First, I would say, at bottom, that I find the baseline outlook to be credible and reasonable.  But it is surrounded by a range of risks that I believe, as do others, are primarily on the upside.  Against that background, it seems prudent to continue to execute our pre-announced strategy.  The economy is growing well and needs less and less stimulus; therefore, continuing to remove our accommodative policy at a measured pace seems to me reasonable. Second, given the stage of the cycle, the skew in the general risk assessment that I outlined, and the need to manage market expectations, I think we should use our statement to signal our awareness that inflation pressures may have picked up.  The incoming data are indicative of that.  If we are wrong on the upside risks, both we and the market will adjust.  On the other hand, if we fail to reflect the existence of these upside risks, we could easily be perceived as being behind the curve, with negative consequences in terms of inflation dynamics and, potentially, our own credibility. Finally, I think the statement, as drafted in the last meeting, clearly links the concept of a measured removal of accommodation with a general sense of the incoming data.  And I believe that gives us the kind of flexibility that we need. Therefore, I’m not terribly supportive of removing the “measured pace” concept at this stage.  I think we have sufficient flexibility using that phrase, when March 22, 2005 65 of 116 how things were evolving. So I would caution against making that kind of change in the statement today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"23";"MR. GRAMLICH.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I will be the fourteenth person to explain why the balance of risks is gradually changing.  A few months ago, we were still worried about supposed soft spots but at this point the expansion looks pretty solid.  Housing and consumption growth remain strong.  The feared pothole in business investment never materialized, which strengthens the forecast in two ways. Not only is there no pothole, but now the strength of investment last year can be attributed to underlying forces, not tax incentives, and carried forward into this year. The international economy looks pretty vigorous, especially for emerging-market countries, and actual output expansion is now being forecast even for Japan.  The Blue Chip forecasts, which I use as a reflection of conditions more than as forecasts, are now being revised upward.  The whole picture looks quite strong, and, if anything, the risks are tilting to the upside. Conditions will be very strong if the personal saving rate doesn’t rise. A recent bank newsletter was entitled “A Whiff of Inflation in the Air.” I actually think it is still possible not to whiff inflation, but there is no denying that the risks are changing. Oil prices have jumped up again both for the spot price and the far futures price.  In contrast March 22, 2005 59 of 116 present uptick seems more likely due to international demand conditions, making the higher prices less idiosyncratic and presumably more lasting.  Other commodity prices have also jumped.  The dollar has fallen already, and there will be continuing fears that it will fall further, with these fears presumably lasting until our international liability ratio stabilizes—a prospect that seems more remote by the day. So far, wages and unit labor costs have been a stabilizing force but wages may become less so as output gaps tighten, and productivity growth rates could at some point stabilize or decline. There is nothing surprising or disappointing in this. If a year ago we had known that output growth would be healthy here and around the world, that output gaps were closing, that oil prices were high, that commodity prices were high, and that the dollar was falling, we all would have been quite worried about inflationary threats. In a way, over this span the anti-inflation news has been reasonably good. Pass-throughs have proved modest, and wages have been rather well behaved.  Productivity has hung in there. But there is still an enhanced risk of inflation. In recent meetings, I have held out one factor that could get me to be less hawkish—the prospect of real fiscal tightening. This has become less likely, too.  There has been a dispute between those who want to cut spending and extend the tax cuts and those who want to maintain spending. When not dealing with steroids in baseball and feeding tubes in Florida, the Congress seems to be working toward one of their unique compromises: Let’s extend the tax cuts and maintain spending. [Laughter] There just doesn’t seem to be much voice for and hope for real fiscal tightening. Hence, whether one is looking at output growth, inflationary pressures, or fiscal policy, the March 22, 2005 60 of 116 for 25 basis points per meeting and for keeping the “measured pace” rhetoric for a little while longer, but I am also for tightening up our rhetoric in subtle or even occasionally non-subtle ways. There has been some dispute about the normative global impact of our low national saving rate, and I would like to say a word about that. When one aggregates the low personal saving and the large budget deficit, the U.S. national saving rate is at a post-war low. How bad is that?  Given what appears to be a saving glut around the world, some argue that it’s actually a good thing our national saving is low. Otherwise, world long-term interest rates would fall to very low levels.  It is definitely good for world savers that our own national saving is low. That maintains their return. But I am still more worried about stimulating world investment than about the returns realized by savers. We all know that in this country the number of workers per retiree will fall from 3.3 now to 2 in about 30 years—2 is actually high by world standards. With present trends and with present policy, the same ratio will be a little more than 1 for Canada, France, Germany, Korea, Russia, and the United Kingdom, and actually less than 1 for Italy and Japan.  That’s right. Those two countries are on track to have more retirees than workers.  Even in most emerging-market countries, the ratio will not be much above 2. Barring the unlikely case where national social security systems are totally fully funded, the younger generations in all of these countries are going to need more capital to pay the retirement and health costs of our generation. Hence, I remain much less worried about the upward pressure that our low national saving puts on world interest rates than the downward pressure it puts on world investment.  Yes, in the short run our high budget deficit and low national saving are benefiting world savers. But, no, in the long run, I don’t think they are benefiting the world. Thank you.

"24";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like others, I’ve been both somewhat surprised but certainly pleased at the steady and strong pace of real GDP and job growth we’ve been experiencing. This positive experience has been mirrored within our Southeast region.  For example, regional retail sales growth in January was 7 percent on a year-over-year basis. This momentum also carried through into February, with inventory accumulation reported to be generally balanced. Factory orders are also continuing to increase. However, like the rest of the nation, one recent soft spot has been new vehicle sales, which remained weak except for some imports and luxury cars.  In contrast, used car sales have improved and, as one might expect, prices of compact and more efficient cars have increased at a faster pace than those of SUVs. Our tourism and hospitality industry continues to give very positive reports, with rising hotel and motel occupancy rates.  It’s clear that the weaker dollar has resulted in a surge in foreign tourists, who are not only visiting but also buying houses in Florida.  Better job creation in our District continues, led by Florida, and the District unemployment rate edged down further in January March 22, 2005 31 of 116 Our banking contacts and supervisory people report continued consumer loan growth, high asset quality, and low past-dues. At the same time, our bank examiners are reporting a pickup in competition for commercial and real estate lending, especially from money center banks.  We received one report of a regional bank losing out on what was essentially a BBB credit. The borrower was offered what amounted to AAA credit financing, at 20 basis points over Libor.  Our bank directors have also expressed concern that the flat yield curve is driving lenders out the maturity spectrum where they are taking more risk in search of returns. I mentioned housing a moment ago.  That sector continues to show strength in our region, with more and more anecdotal reports that can only reflect speculative activity along many parts of the Florida coast. Investors are making significant capital gains buying and reselling condo units before the contractor has even broken ground. But such speculation isn’t confined to multifamily condo units. We’re also seeing some of that same speculation in Florida single-family detached homes, a much larger part of the total residential market, although the very high levels of permits and sales per capita are partly explained by the underlying demand for such houses for relocation and second homes. Turning to developments at the national level, I find that I can almost repeat the points I made at last month’s meeting.  The rates of real growth and job creation are very encouraging.  My growing concern, which has been heightened slightly over the intermeeting period because of the continued reports of housing speculation and the potential underpricing of risk, is the inflation situation. It’s clear from the incoming information on prices—the surge in PCE and PPI data in some recent months, the changes in the Greenbook inflation forecasts, and recent changes in the trend patterns of key components comprising the measures of core CPI—that both goods and March 22, 2005 32 of 116 Are we at the point where it’s time to change the path of policy?  I don’t think we are there yet. I continue to believe that we are on the right policy path, at least for now, and that we should resist the temptation at this meeting to deviate from it.  While inflation pressures and potential pressures have clearly increased, much of the recent surge we’ve been seeing in core goods inflation is coming from the rise in used car prices, which we believe is driven by the pullback in new car incentives and the slowdown of used cars coming on the market.  In addition, as of January, a large number of components of the core CPI—actually 20—still continue to show declines as compared with 32 components that are showing increases. Finally, while there has been some deterioration in short-term inflation expectations, longer- term expectations have not moved measurably.  While I am comfortable with our current policy path, I believe that what we say in the statement has, in fact, become even more important and more sensitive. While our current policy path seems to me to address the risks as I see them today, I would like us to find the opportunity sometime soon to underscore the need for more flexibility to respond to incoming data.  The inflation risks are worrisome and could deteriorate, and we may, in fact, need to use that additional flexibility before too long. I’ll comment more later about suggested changes to the statement language.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"25";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, looking at the economy, we expect growth will be in line with what others have said—in the 4 percent range this year and slightly above 3½ percent next year. With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, obviously the output gap and labor market slack are diminishing.  There are a whole host of reasons for that, which Dave already outlined, and I won’t repeat them. I will say that from the Tenth District perspective, our information supports this more robust March 22, 2005 28 of 116 addition, travel and tourism continued to improve, as the dollar has helped to increase ski visits and hotel occupancy in the mountain states.  Labor markets remain strong, with hiring announcements exceeding layoffs by about a 1¼-to-1 ratio since our previous FOMC meeting.  And, finally, District manufacturing continues to expand strongly.  Production, new orders, and employment all rose in February. Moreover, firms remain optimistic about future activity and plan moderate increases in employment and capital spending going forward this year. I’ll make most of my comments on the inflation outlook, because I do have some concern about that. I was struck by David’s point that, as for inflation breaking out, he would put it in terms of a “not yet” statement.  But as I view the outlook, I expect, even with the fed funds rate rising as we currently are projecting, that inflation will increase and perhaps could accelerate in 2005 and 2006. Here are some reasons for that.  First, we have been in an accommodative mode of policy for an extended period of time now—years, not quarters—with the fed funds rate below most estimates of neutral over much of that period.  Core inflation, by whatever measure you pick—core CPI or PCE or the market-based core PCE—drifted higher last year.  Not only did core inflation drift higher, it was unexpectedly higher than earlier projections. This unexpected increase is notable because it occurred even though real GDP growth was as expected and the fed funds rate was being increased. If inflation could increase that much last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising fed funds rate, I am concerned that, with less slack in the economy this year, we will end up with yet higher inflation. In addition, a number of indicators suggest continuing inflationary pressures.  For example, we have higher cost pressures resulting from higher commodity prices, which we mentioned, and March 22, 2005 29 of 116 in unit labor costs that may not be dramatic yet, but they are increasing.  Wage pressures are emerging in our District.  About a quarter of the employers we contacted said that they’ve had to raise wages more than normal, particularly for skilled workers. We are also seeing evidence of increased pricing power in the Tenth District, as firms have more confidence in their ability to raise output prices even without an increase in input costs.  For example, we asked our survey participants a special question about whether their ability to raise prices had improved since the beginning of just this year.  Of 77 responses, more than half said clearly yes. The final reason I see an upside risk for inflation is that monetary policy does, in fact, remain accommodative.  The federal funds rate is currently below most estimates of the neutral rate.  Even with the Greenbook’s assumptions of tighter policy, the fed funds rate will end the year below or at the lower end of estimates of the medium-run neutral rate.  This poses a significant upside risk to inflation, because it is likely that much of the slack in the economy will have been eliminated by the end of the year. With output close to potential and core inflation elevated, I think we should aim to be comfortably within the range of neutral by the end of the year, not at the lower end. Overall, with growth above trend, I am concerned that there is an upside risk to inflation even with the funds rate path consistent with the projections we are seeing currently. I believe we should begin moving more aggressively to bring the fed funds rate closer to the long-run neutral rate sooner. I would submit that, as long as the funds rate remains significantly below neutral, the risk that we will need to raise it 50 basis points can be managed.  Now, I say that, but I also realize that a 50 basis point increase, while it could be justified, would surprise financial markets.  So perhaps we should begin to signal the market that a more aggressive return to neutral is at least possible.  But March 22, 2005 30 of 116 prefer to shorten it and drop any reference to measured pace.  After reading the minutes in three weeks, markets will know that a more aggressive policy is possible.  In other words, we don’t have to provide a long explanation today. And in fact, in testimony you gave earlier, I think you dropped the “measured” language; therefore, I don’t think changing that part of the statement would surprise the markets at all.  Thanks."
"26";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Activity has come in somewhat stronger in recent months, and price pressures have been a bit more intense than anticipated at the last FOMC meeting. Evidently, continued good growth in income and high profits are keeping household spending rising briskly and eroding any remaining business caution. The fact that surprises have been concentrated in investment in both business equipment and housing may also suggest that the low long-term rates—the conundrum—have been having an effect. If, as seems likely, those rates have been reduced in part by declining term premiums, as President Yellen was discussing, and not just by an expected lack of vigor in demand here or abroad, their depressed real level would represent a net stimulus to demand most especially for business borrowers who are facing very low risk premiums.  In fact, business borrowing has strengthened considerably in the fourth and first quarters. And after an extended period in which cash flows have exceeded business investment, low interest rates and ebbing caution have produced a positive business financing gap in the fourth quarter, which is projected to continue for the first quarter. Moreover, the U.S. economy is not the only one in which growth has picked up; the strengthening of demand seems widespread globally after the disappointments in the second half of last year. And I agree with others who have noted that the sharp upward movement in energy and other commodity prices probably reflects in part this global pickup in demand. The surprise in core PCE prices was only for one month and was small relative to our March 22, 2005 66 of 116 prices, and import prices could be passing through to consumer prices more than anticipated.  This, coupled with the rise in near-term inflation expectations, does elevate the risk of second-round effects from such relative price movements.  And those relative price adjustments have continued in recent weeks. Still, a number of factors seem to be working to restrain tendencies for inflation to move higher, and we can’t ignore those. Importantly, productivity growth was stronger in the fourth quarter, and, apparently, in the first quarter, than anticipated.  Whether that suggests faster structural productivity growth than the staff has built in remains to be seen, but revisions to actual productivity growth will help keep pressures off of labor costs and markups.  Partly as a consequence, markups in the nonfarm business sector remain at extraordinarily high levels, giving ample scope for future cost increases to be at least partly absorbed in reduced margins.  And wage and compensation growth remain essentially flat, indicating to me that slack in labor markets persists, given the upward pressures on compensation that would otherwise be anticipated from rising headline inflation and the rapid productivity growth of recent years. Bond rates have risen noticeably. To be sure, the upward movement seems mostly to reflect higher inflation expectations, but higher nominal rates could have a noticeable effect on housing markets where buyers seem sensitive to the cash flow implications of their monthly obligations. House price increases should slow quite a bit, in any case, holding back the rise in wealth and boosting incentives to save out of current income.  In addition, GDP hasn’t been revised up as much as demand.  As the trade deficit continues to surprise on the high side, the staff forecast has net exports turning from a drag on activity to a more neutral influence.  But until we see the data confirming that shift, I think the possibility of more demand being drained abroad remains a March 22, 2005 67 of 116 The final and most important force that ultimately will constrain inflation is tightening monetary policy.  And the narrowing output gap and the possible emergence of greater inflation pressures do raise questions about how we need to adapt our strategy to keep inflation low and the risks in balance. Two possible responses: One would be to count on extending the gradual path of rate increases to go for longer before slowing or stopping.  The other approach would be to increase the incline—prepare to raise rates by 50 basis points soon. For the most part, extending the measured path seems preferable to me.  At the same time I think we should make it clear to markets that we are prepared to extend that path, should circumstances call for it, and that we have no firm preconceived notion regarding where our tightening should stop.  The gradual approach should enable us to better gauge the ongoing effects of our actions in an uncertain world. It will give us more opportunities to assess the effects of past tightening moves when we know that those effects can vary and will occur with a lag. Hence it will give us more opportunities to calibrate our actions better to the needs of the economy. To date, announcing that we expect to remove accommodation at a measured pace hasn’t materially impeded the markets from responding meaningfully and appropriately to incoming data. Over the last intermeeting period, they extended the anticipated series of gradual rate increases— forward rates two and three years out are up by more than 50 basis points over that period, and this seems completely appropriate to me. The structure of interest rates still seems to be consistent with achieving our objectives.  The staff forecast has inflation declining with about the policy tightening that is built into the market. Even if we’re not quite as optimistic on price pressures as the staff, gradual increases in the funds rate in line with market expectations should provide some insurance against rising inflation. March 22, 2005 68 of 116 participants expect that the policy actions they now anticipate will be enough to insulate the longer- term trajectory for prices from near-term increases in inflation. As a consequence, “measured” is still my best guess as to how policy rates will evolve, and that’s what I would continue to indicate to the public.  Nonetheless, our expectation of a measured pace of firming has always been conditional.  And one essential condition that we have articulated and emphasized in the last sentence of the announcement is that inflation and its expectations remain well behaved. In my view, that would be consistent with the rate of growth of core PCE prices stabilizing at levels close to or not very much above the experience of the last year.  If doubts about our willingness to maintain price stability emerge, I can see the potential for a very difficult self- reinforcing feedback loop through declining confidence in policymaking in the United States and accelerated dollar depreciation. Incoming information suggesting that core prices will continue to accelerate, or that the output gap is closing rapidly, or that longer-run inflation expectations are deteriorating, could well call for deviating from the measured pace with a larger firming action.  If the signs were serious enough, I think we could, and should, do that as soon as the next meeting, even if the “measured pace” language remains in place.  After an expression of concern about inflation pressures, as suggested in alternative B, the market should not be entirely surprised by such an action under those circumstances.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"27";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In recent weeks, we have received evidence of a continuation in the slowing growth in our District that we noted in our Beige Book report.  Retail sales, which in the Beige Book were reported as having leveled off, began declining in early March by our indicators. A slump in big-ticket sales has evidently dragged down retail activity in recent weeks. District manufacturing activity continued to expand but at a slower pace than in February. Our March diffusion index, to be released this morning, came in at about neutral, which is down a bit from February. Interestingly, hardly any of our textile and apparel industry contacts are citing the surge in imports from China as an important factor for them.  Their reports on shipment trends are fairly evenly split between expanding and declining. We continue to receive reports of substantially higher raw materials prices across an array of industries. The housing market remains quite strong in several areas in our District.  Concerns over so- called bubble conditions are widespread among our real estate contacts, especially in Northern Virginia and in coastal areas, although prices seem to have topped out in several high-end coastal March 22, 2005 39 of 116 In banking, the CEO of a community bank operating in North Carolina and the western portion of Virginia said business is as strong as train smoke.  Not being very familiar with train smoke, I asked him how strong a reading that represented.  He noted about the only thing stronger was battery acid. [Laughter] Turning to the national picture, the economy looks noticeably stronger today than it did at the end of January. The Greenbook now estimates that real GDP grew at 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, substantially higher than the previously estimated 3.5 percent.  First-quarter real GDP growth has been revised up substantially. Expected future real GDP growth is essentially unchanged. And there is little revision to the path of potential output over the forecast period. The slowly improving labor market suggests that the output gap is still on track to continue diminishing in the near future. On the inflation front, unit labor costs continue to be well behaved. The recent spurt in energy and import prices has elevated the overall indexes, but any spillover into the core indexes seems likely to abate.  So I’d expect core PCE inflation to return to near 1½ percent after not too long. The Greenbook forecast is conditioned on a path for the fed funds rate 50 basis points higher than in January, a path that nearly matches the market’s expectation over the forecast horizon.  All in all, I think this is a good outlook. In my view the most likely risk is that inflation expectations will be driven higher—by a more sustained increase in oil prices, by a sharper depreciation of the dollar, or by a more rapid closing of the output gap than we expect. The most worrisome evidence of rising inflation expectations is the change in market measures of near-term inflation compensation.  For example, the TIPS five-year inflation March 22, 2005 40 of 116 third of a percentage point since the last FOMC meeting.  We would expect large oil price increases to generate some movement in these compensation measures based on anticipations of pass-through to consumer energy prices.  So the recent increase in the five-year TIPS spread may reflect merely a sort of expected arithmetical pipeline of future CPI increases.  And, consistent with this, chart 1 of the Bluebook shows that a substantial portion of the increase is attributable to the first year of the five-year horizon and that compensation for years four and five hasn’t moved much. On the other hand, the Bluebook also shows that significant increases have occurred over the intermeeting period in forward inflation compensation two and three years out, and these movements seem hard to rationalize based on the current pipeline effects alone.  Of course, these expectations pertain to the headline CPI figure, which is going to be elevated only temporarily above core inflation, I think. Indeed, the Greenbook calls for core CPI inflation to remain anchored at close to 2 percent, and that’s a projection I’m quite comfortable with. All this suggests that inflation expectations, although they have been creeping up, are not yet a problem.  We’ll have to adapt our plans, however, if inflation expectations behave in a way that is inconsistent with our intentions. We can start by making sure that our behavior is not exacerbating the problem. The public learned from the minutes of our February meeting that we had deferred specifying a quantitative target range for inflation. That left open the question of how much more inflation we would be willing to tolerate. If we’re not willing to specify a numerical target or upper bound for inflation, then we should find some other way to signal our determination to hold the line on inflation somewhere, preferably before that line is crossed.  Thank you. March 22, 2005 41 of 116"
"28";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Activity continues to firm in the Seventh District. In general, my contacts are more upbeat than they were a couple of months ago, and there is much more confidence that the expansion is on a solid, self-sustaining footing.  And we’re hearing more news about price increases and price pressures.  Nevertheless, activity has not yet heated up to the point that there is broad-based pressure on capacity. The positive news is fairly widespread. Demand continues to be robust for heavy trucks and for equipment used in construction, agriculture, and oil and gas industries. Our contacts in retail trade, including shopping mall operators, and in consumer advertising also tell us that business is good The news on hiring, however, is more subdued.  Notably, the two major temporary-help firms headquartered in our District reported that their growth has slowed since our last meeting. Also, there is an important downside risk for our District’s economy:  The well-publicized woes of General Motors and Ford could develop into an even larger drag than we have seen to date. It’s not clear how the auto market will evolve in 2005.  Year-to-date sales have been weak, as automakers appear to be testing the market with lower incentives.  Still, the Big Three have not yet backed off their earlier projections that light vehicle sales will run about 16¾ million units this year.  They are hoping that sales will increase as the year proceeds, similar to the pattern in 2004 after they raised incentives. But based on our conversations, it is unclear whether the automakers will be willing to March 22, 2005 26 of 116 Given the increasing momentum in the District economy, we took a hard look at resource constraints and price pressures. Heavy vehicle production continues to be constrained by shortages of engines, axles, and especially tires. And Caterpillar expects production to be straining capacity at least through 2005. On the price front, the environment has clearly changed.  For example, the head of a large bank told me that, for the first time in many years, suppliers are telling customers to buy now or pay higher prices in 30 days. Manufacturers’ long-term contracts for materials are running out, and several report paying premiums in order to ensure supply and keep production running at full tilt. As more of these long-term contracts expire, cost pressures and pass-through could intensify.  Even auto suppliers are digging in their heels and resisting further price reductions. In contrast, the steel price picture looks better, as you mentioned earlier.  As one contact noted, this is perhaps due in part to increased production in China. Also, on the international scene, a major retailer told us that his European suppliers recently boosted prices between 8 and 12 percent after holding the line last year. In response, the retailer shifted some business to suppliers in the Far East. Turning to the national economy, it’s clear that growth is on firm, self-sustaining ground.  So our focus should shift more to assessing inflationary pressures, and there are indications that inflation risks may have increased.  Recent price data and, as I just mentioned, comments from our business contacts, do have a firmer tone.  Oil prices continue to surprise us on the upside, the declining dollar is showing through to higher import prices, TIPS measures of inflation compensation have moved up, and resource slack could be smaller than we thought.  In particular, work done by our Bank’s economists—and by the Board staff, as Dave discussed—suggests that March 22, 2005 27 of 116 These developments have increased our inflation forecast, but quantifying the extent of the inflation risk is difficult. When we run our models using data back to the 1960s, the models forecast higher PCE inflation—nearly 2 percent this year and next year. But the economy has changed a lot, particularly starting in the early 1980s. When we limit the data to the last 20 years, the uptick is diminished.  Furthermore, I do not get the impression that a 1970s-type inflationary mentality is creeping into my contacts’ decisionmaking processes. So, on balance, taking everything into consideration, I think we can continue our pattern of measured rate increases, and I don’t think we need major changes in the wording of our statement at this meeting.  Futures markets expect us to move the funds rate to 3¾ percent by year-end.  But if a more aggressive tightening is warranted, we could easily get to 4¼ percent just by increasing the funds rate 25 basis points at each meeting.  This would be perfectly consistent with our “measured pace” language. But we may need to move more aggressively after this meeting; some warning clouds have clearly developed. We often say we need to be data-dependent.  I think it’s particularly important now.  We’ll get two months of price data before our May meeting and, of course, a lot of other data. And we’ll want to look carefully at those data in assessing our next steps."
"29";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my comments I want to follow up on President March 22, 2005 70 of 116 increasing anecdotal evidence and concern about this issue, and I think the characterization in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal that day trading is now occurring in residential housing markets is a further indication of the concern. Of course, the extent to which the speculative purchases make a difference is reflected not only in the possibility of its impacting the pace of the growth in housing values but also the pricing of risk, as Jack suggested. But I think the question has been whether or not the size of the market was significant enough to have an impact.  Clearly, the trend was eye- catching, but was the market significant enough to make a significant difference? Data collected recently and provided by our economists indicate that non-owner-occupied mortgages constitute 5½ percent of the total outstanding and have fluctuated around 7 percent of new originations. With respect to second homes, the numbers were about 2.8 percent of total mortgage loans and 3 percent of new originations.  However, this week, the National Association of Realtors revised significantly their sense of the size of the market, based on surveys they had made and also on information from the 2003 Census Bureau report.  They indicated that, in their view, 23 percent of all home purchases in 2004 were for investment and an additional 13 percent were for vacation homes.  The difference was that through their surveys they have been able to isolate the investment purchaser of single-family homes as distinct from the purchaser of a second home.  The implications of that are significant, and the size of the market is much larger than they had perceived. Also, those numbers would suggest that many of those buyers have made multiple purchases of single-family homes, which brings in another element of risk—the risk associated with the debt service capability they need to maintain those purchases in the event of a downturn. I think it’s appropriate that we are going to be looking at the issue of real estate bubbles and the speculative component of that market at our meeting in June.  There are a number of indications March 22, 2005 71 of 116 tightened their loan requirements for interest-only loans and for those with low down payments. And we have seen the criteria for loans being tightened in other places also. With respect to our policy decision today, I think the question is not so much what we should do but how we explain why we are doing it. As Governor Ferguson did, let me take you back 18 months, when we began using the phrase “for a considerable period.”  Notwithstanding the impact on implied volatility, also implicit in the statement “for a considerable period” was that there needed to be an exit strategy. And the exit strategy—or transition, if you will—went from “considerable period” to “patient” to “measured pace.”  I don’t think today is the time to change “measured pace,” but it’s time to think about an exit strategy from it.  Thank you."
"30";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One of my business contacts, my Wal-Mart contact, started our conversation by saying that the situation is rather strange—his word.  Spending coming out of the Christmas season has been higher than anticipated—with same-store sales about 4 percent higher on a year-over-year basis—and they’re not sure where this strength is coming from. They are anticipating about that same strength, or maybe even a bit more, going forward.  He noted that their inflation situation is not a concern. Their prices overall are flat; food prices are up a little and prices of nonfood items are down a little.  The labor market is very stable; Wal-Mart is having no problem at all hiring associates at their stores. My UPS contact noted an expansion of their capital spending. He said that business from retail mail order firms is very strong.  He indicated that his company has some labor concerns.  They March 22, 2005 48 of 116 doing contingency planning for it. They do not believe that the rest of the industry has the capacity to fill in, should UPS be shut down. My FedEx contact noted also an increase in capital spending, up 15 percent for this fiscal year over last fiscal year. He indicated that about two-thirds of that is for expansion of capacity and about one-third for productivity enhancements.  Also, he said that they had no concern regarding labor availability. Fuel prices, obviously, are a concern for them. My contact in the trucking industry had contrary information.  He said that demand is softer than anticipated and that there has been a switch from prebookings for truck shipping services to last-minute bookings.  He also noted that the driver shortage is getting worse and worse. A contact in a major software company said that sales had come in a little soft relative to their expectations but attributed it to Intel coming up short on inventory—I think particularly on notebook computers.  Apparently Intel was surprised by demand that was higher than anticipated. Also, I might mention that a contact in the banking industry noted that C&I [commercial and industrial] loans year-over-year are now positive and accelerating and that there appears to be a lot of momentum. Let me turn now to some comments about the economy in general.  We have in place a very broad-based and robust recovery. Business fixed investment is taking hold and taking the lead.  I think it’s highly likely, of course, that employment and income will grow, which will provide support for consumption, as the Greenbook emphasizes.  So even if we had a welcome increase in the saving rate, we’d probably see continued strength in consumption. The Greenbook contains—and we continue to hear elsewhere—a lot of comments on energy prices. In my view, it’s very important that we think of energy prices as being demand-driven.  This March 22, 2005 49 of 116 appropriate to think about what the world would look like if energy prices had not increased and how much gets taken off growth.  But I’m not sure that that’s quite the right way to look at this, because the situation is being driven fundamentally by demand.  It’s not that output is being constrained by energy; it’s that vigorous output growth is driving up energy prices. As for labor compensation, productivity gains are holding down growth in unit labor costs. That’s a source of great stability. Let me make a general point about this expansion that really took hold roughly six quarters ago. Relative to U.S. business cycle history, this expansion has been one of the most orderly and best predicted. The forecast errors are astonishingly small—much lower than the usual standard errors that we see—and I think that has a lot to do with the very well-balanced and orderly nature of the expansion. This expansion is about as surprise-free as we ever see. I think our policy goal should be to maintain the orderly nature of the expansion as far as we can, and, of course, that includes as an essential element maintaining the stable inflation environment. I think the staff forecasts for both real GDP and inflation make a lot of sense.  As point forecasts, they’re as good as one can find. I think the risks around the GDP forecast are probably pretty symmetrical, but I do not believe that the risks around the inflation forecast are symmetrical.  I view the inflation forecast more as a median of the distribution than a mean.  I think the distribution is skewed to the right—that there’s a substantially higher probability that we could have a ½-point upside surprise than a ½-point downside surprise on the inflation outcome.  That’s all I’ll say at this time.  Thank you."
"31";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in the outlook for the Third District since my last report.  Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace in most sectors in the region, and most of our business contacts expect the current pace of activity to be maintained through the spring. Recent readings from our business outlook survey indicate that regional manufacturing March 22, 2005 33 of 116 2003 and early 2004, but that is to be expected. In March, the general activity index fell to 11.4, a fairly sharp decline from last month’s reading of nearly 24.  I don’t read too much into this.  The index has been fairly volatile over the past three months, but it remains at a level that is typical of expansions. Consumers continue to spend at a moderate pace.  Winter merchandise has been cleared out through discounting, and spring apparel is selling well. Most of our retail contacts have said that sales are running close to plan. As was true last month, nonresidential construction in our region remained soft.  However, office-leasing activity in the Philadelphia metropolitan area has begun to rise, with five consecutive quarters of positive absorption. Vacancy rates have improved slightly.  Residential construction has remained healthy, but it’s down from its peak last spring.  And house-price acceleration continues, but at a slower pace than earlier last year. Employment is increasing in the region, but our directors and our other business contacts continue to report on the scarcity of qualified workers. Some firms have resorted to trying to bus people in from other localities, with mixed success.  A temp agency customer indicated that they’ve had no objections to recent wage increases, expecting that they would help ease the labor shortage. But, so far, at least, this has not been the case. The manager for the temp agency said that the likely enactment of a $2 increase over two years in the New Jersey minimum wage to $7.15 per hour will have little effect on her business, as her workers already earn more than that.  However, the New Jersey Department of Labor estimates that 16 percent of hourly workers earn less than $7.15 an hour. There is some evidence that the pricing power of firms in the region is rising.  The March 22, 2005 34 of 116 who recently put through a price increase to his customers said he now regrets not having made a larger increase, given the ease with which it was accepted. In summary, the economic expansion continues at a moderate pace in the Third District. Labor markets appear to be tightening, price pressures may be building, and the outlook among business contacts in our region remains positive. My assessment of the economic conditions in the nation has changed somewhat since we last met.  The incoming data and forecasts seem to be indicating that the underlying economy has more momentum than I thought a month ago.  At that time, I had characterized the economy as growing at a moderate pace.  I would now say it’s growing at a solid pace. We have transitioned from a consumption-led to an investment-led expansion.  Other than nonresidential construction, no sector is showing signs of weakness despite higher oil prices. In addition, the labor market has strengthened.  Payrolls have risen at a 1.8 percent annual pace over the last 12 months.  That’s less than the 2.6 percent annual rate we saw from the end of 1992 to 1997, but remember that at the end of 1992 the unemployment rate was 7.4 percent.  With the unemployment rate now under 5.5 percent, the current pace of employment growth is probably about right. We are at a point in the business cycle at which we need to be very watchful about inflation dynamics and inflation expectations.  In the middle of 2003, the 12-month core inflation measures had fallen to around 1 percent and the Committee embarked upon a reflation policy.  This policy was successful. Our actions have increased the inflation rate to the midpoint of my acceptable range. Our job now is to set policy to ensure that inflation does not accelerate beyond that acceptable range. In my view, the signs of a pickup in underlying inflation and in inflation expectations March 22, 2005 35 of 116 acceleration in core consumer good prices, oil prices have risen substantially—as we heard this morning—and the dollar has declined considerably.  All of this poses a real inflation risk going forward. More significantly, medium-term inflation expectations, as measured by the spread between nominal and inflation-indexed yields, appear to be shifting upward.  With forecasts of inflation moving up, albeit not yet to an alarming rate, it would behoove us to respond in some fashion. We all know that we cannot wait until we see a sustained acceleration in inflation if we want to do something about it. All this suggests that it is important for us to remain vigilant about signs of higher inflation and to take steps now to increase our flexibility in adjusting the funds rate path going forward. Indeed, with the real funds rate still quite low and monetary policy accommodative, I’m putting more weight on the possibility that we will have to raise rates at a faster pace than we anticipated a month ago.  It could very well be that a measured pace, interpreted by the market as moves of 25 basis points, still characterizes the most likely path for policy going forward.  But, in my view, the possibility that a steeper path may be needed has risen since our last meeting. If others on the Committee feel as I do, then I think we need to find a way to convey this shift in priors to the public. One way to do that is to reword our statement to clearly acknowledge the increase in inflation pressures. We can do this in the rationale language or in the assessment of risk language or both. Another way is to acknowledge that a faster pace may be necessary in order to fulfill our dual mandate.  I’ll defer getting into the specifics of the language until the next part of our discussion. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. March 22, 2005 36 of 116"
"32";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The broad-based expansion in our District March 22, 2005 50 of 116 growing rapidly. Demand for construction equipment reportedly is very strong.  Backlogs are building in that sector, and there are long lead times.  There is an emerging scarcity of some skilled labor. The mining and energy sectors, not surprisingly, are strong.  Housing construction activity remains robust, although sales have slowed a bit year-over-year.  The concerns expressed by business leaders are the usual suspects: medical insurance costs, rising raw material prices— including energy, of course—and rising transportation costs. Turning to broader issues, based on the tenor of the incoming information on the economy and on my earlier forecast, the national economy continues to look quite good to me.  It’s still early in the game, of course, but 4 percent real growth this year looks like a reasonable forecast.  It would not be a stretch but simply a continuation of what we’ve experienced in the previous two years. As far as inflation is concerned, I do not expect a material acceleration in core measures of inflation this year. Nevertheless, I do see signs that there is some buildup in price pressures. Therefore, it seems to me that the risks we are confronting are in the process of shifting, mostly because the risks of a subpar or disappointing performance of the real economy have diminished but also because the inflation pressures have perhaps ticked up a notch. I think the policy implication of this is that we can continue for now with the program that we have been on of ¼-point increases in the funds rate. But I do think we need to modify the language in the announcement to reflect changing circumstances and to preserve internal consistency."
"33";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic growth this quarter, as several of you have noted, has been stronger than we earlier had anticipated. Retail sales excluding autos have grown at over a 9 percent annual rate in the first two months of the quarter.  Business investment has been strong and does not show a significant decline as a result of companies having moved March 22, 2005 69 of 116 purposes. Manufacturing output has also been growing soundly, and capacity usage is now close to its average of the last decade at 78.5 percent. And employment has been growing at a good pace. Over the last few months, we have seen core inflation move modestly higher.  And we are seeing data that indicate price pressures coming from both the sales and the cost sides of companies. The strong growth of recent months is making it easier to raise prices, and rising costs from both commodities and labor are also adding to cost pressures.  This economic expansion is reaching its fourth anniversary, and sales levels now are giving businesses the confidence to be able to raise prices. The Beige Book and comments by several of the Presidents today indicate that businesses are finding it easier to do so. The NFIB survey shows more pricing power for small businesses, and other business surveys are indicating the same.  As Dave Stockton noted earlier, rising import prices are also giving domestic companies more pricing power. On the cost side, the extraordinary pace of productivity growth has slowed in the past year. Productivity grew at a 5.6 percent pace in the year ending in the first quarter 2004, but fell to about one-fourth that pace in the second half of last year. While productivity is still very strong from an historical perspective, it has slowed enough that the direction of unit labor costs has changed. Unit labor costs began rising in the second quarter of 2004, after falling for two years, and grew at 2.3 percent in the last quarter. Thus, with the outlook for continued strong economic growth, I believe that we cannot be as sanguine about the trend in prices in coming months.  We need to be signaling that we are more dependent on incoming data, and I think that requires a change from the “measured pace” language to give us more flexibility in the months ahead.  Thank you."
"34";"MS. HOLCOMB.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy in the Eleventh District has been gaining strength since last November.  The most recent data, in combination with anecdotal March 22, 2005 51 of 116 ahead. Importantly, the recovery in Texas employment growth is becoming more broad-based across the major sectors of the economy.  In addition, 2004 marked the first year since 2000 that the private sector showed positive job growth. As might be expected given the surge in energy prices, the Texas rig count and support services for oil and gas are expanding briskly. The Texas rig count has roughly tripled since 1999 and is up about 30 percent in the last year alone. In spite of the high demand for rigs, our directors report many instances of rigs lying stacked in the field.  With experienced rig crews in short supply, concerns about legal liabilities have caused oil companies to leave some rigs idle.  Our contacts also report shortages of drilling pipe, because, in their words, China is sucking up every ounce of steel. At our last directors’ meeting, one of our banker directors reported the first oil and gas activity in his area in 30 years. An additional sign of the market’s responsiveness to the anticipated strength of energy prices is a resurgence of institutional money seeking out energy exploration deals in the Unites States and Canada. Both our directors and members of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Agriculture report a sharp increase in demand for cattle ranches in rural Texas and for extremely high-end apartments in Dallas and Houston.  Several members of these two groups spoke of a paradigm shift taking place, away from holding financial assets toward holding tangible assets, such as land, cattle, oil, and housing. They all noted an abundance of money flowing in, often in cash deals.  Another director noted that the flow of venture capital to Texas farms has picked up. Turning to the national economy, I’d like to provide support for the Greenbook’s conclusion about the extra positive thrust in the economy by noting that congressional hearings have been focusing on the use of steroids in major league baseball rather than the economy.  [Laughter] If March 22, 2005 52 of 116 good season in 2005 for all the reasons that have been enumerated.  A key question is: What will be the impact when the removal of last year’s monetary policy steroids stimulus shows up with the usual lag? Given the outlook for energy prices built into the Greenbook, as well as the higher fed funds path, it seems that the growth slowdown in 2006 could be greater than anticipated, particularly if financial conditions weaken, as in the higher bond premium scenario in the Greenbook.  At the last Dallas board of directors meeting, in response to the Chairman’s testimony about the long-term bond rate conundrum, there was some discussion of a somewhat different scenario.  The directors were concerned about the potential for a very flat Treasury yield curve, given the market’s anticipation of a much higher fed funds rate by early 2006.  While the Dallas research staff noted that the slope of the yield curve doesn’t have the predictive power it used to, our directors, nonetheless, felt uneasy about this situation. The run-up in Treasury yields over the last couple of weeks has probably reduced their concerns, but this scenario has made them cautious about continued tightening. Our information supports the Greenbook’s projection that business investment in equipment and software will hold up well this year.  Over the last six months or so, the Dallas directors have been discussing the extent to which the very low level of investment spending over the 2000 to 2003 period has reduced the level of effective capacity in their industries. A few of our directors believe that some operations may have become economically obsolete, need to be written off, and ought to be replaced with newer technology. It seems clear that the Committee will be considering holding a retirement party for the term “measured pace” in order to increase flexibility going forward.  We would support giving “measured pace” a gold watch after a career of serving the System well.  While there is sufficient rationale for March 22, 2005 53 of 116 end would require a pause for a meeting or two in the cycle of raising rates, and the current wording is an impediment to doing so. For today’s policy action, I would support a ¼-point increase as a further step in getting to neutral. As for the more difficult question of determining when we have reached neutral, I will leave that to Mr. Fisher. Thank you. [Laughter],  I’ll whisper in his ear before he comes to the meeting.  [Laughter],  Thanks. I really appreciate it."
"35";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity seems definitely on the upswing in New England. As we discussed conditions with our Beige Book contacts, met with our small business advisory group, and talked in some depth with local temporary-help agencies and software developers—as we did our usual round of contacts—the themes of solid growth and increasing confidence were repeated with some frequency. Manufacturers, especially those that have some defense business, report very good sales, and, at least in the case of one large manufacturer, an inability to keep up with demand.  Labor markets have strengthened as well, and benchmark revisions to employment data indicate that 2004 was a better period for job growth in New England than previously thought.  Temporary help agencies report good demand for labor, and help-wanted is stronger, as judged by both traditional measures and the indexed data on the region that are available from Monster.com.  Housing remains strong, though we don’t see much sign of speculation and there is some softness at the upper end of the price range. Retail business is reported to be good, and both business and consumer confidence has increased. Contacts in the regional economy appear to be moving from a focus on concerns about March 22, 2005 45 of 116 of small businesses in the period since our February meeting, and they almost uniformly report rising costs of raw materials and labor that are starting to impact their prices.  In a growing number of cases, these firms have been able to make price increases stick, even to big buyers like Wal-Mart, though, largely, the price increases have been in the form of surcharges. Skilled workers are becoming difficult to find.  Businesses report that they’re in a hiring mode and have to pay up to get the people they need.  Some companies have begun to hire in advance of need, simply to have a pool of available workers.  Capital spending plans seem quite solid, and now there is a mixture of firms spending not only to further increase productivity but also to expand to handle increased business. Two areas of concern emerged beyond those related to rising costs.  The first involves tourism in northern New England.  Evidently, while this was a snowy year in the southern part of our region, the northern areas have suffered from both too little snow and the timing of storms, which created weekend travel problems.  The second is a continued sluggishness in commercial real estate markets.  Given the number of large mergers affecting the region, both in the financial services industry and elsewhere, and the reduction of headquarters staff that has resulted, commercial vacancy rates remain high and rents low—especially in downtown and suburban Boston. I should say the rents are relatively low, since Boston rents tend to be high anyway. This has not, however, seemed to put much of a crimp in the market for purchasing commercial buildings, which continues to be quite strong. Turning to the national scene, I’ve been struck by the strength of the incoming economic data, as has everyone else. We in Boston have adjusted our forecast upward, especially in the near March 22, 2005 46 of 116 Greenbook over the forecast horizon, though our calculations suggest some greater economic capacity and less downward pressure on the unemployment rate. However, there is not a lot to argue about here, given the continuing upside surprises in overall economic growth and in price pressures.  Indeed, it seems clear to me that the underlying rationale we have used in moving policy slowly and gradually to a less accommodative place is becoming questionable.  Unlike last year when growth seemed fragile and uncertain, economic growth now seems solid and resilient and in less need of policy accommodation.  Overall credit and financial conditions are supportive, if not encouraging, to spending and growth.  Business investment is not taking a breather with the ending of the tax incentive, and consumers aren’t either, except in their post-holiday purchases of autos. Surely it is possible to see downside risks from a rise in the saving rate, from an untoward increase in oil prices that impacts demand, or from an impact arising out of the external deficit.  But I think it’s even easier to imagine upside inflation surprises as rising energy, raw material, import, and labor costs get embedded into economic activity.  In that regard, I found the Greenbook alternatives focused on a spending boom and on a boom with rising inflation expectations very interesting. I should also note that while my admiration for the FRB/US model is enormous, I think it’s difficult for any model to correctly anticipate the full interplay of economic factors once the unexpected happens. The baseline, I think, is still pretty much a good, solid forecast.  Continued solid productivity growth will keep nascent cost pressures and inflation expectations under control. However, the risks that this will not happen seem to me to have grown and to have become a bit more one-sided.  That is, I think we need to be more focused on the risks that rising cost pressures will get out of hand. March 22, 2005 47 of 116 case could be made for moving faster rather than slower toward that so-called neutral place.  Taking larger steps now would have the benefit of affecting market attitudes toward risk in a positive way, largely because it is not what markets expect us to do. That option has some attraction to me.  But it could be too much of a surprise and indicate too much concern about future prospects than perhaps is necessary.  However, we could take advantage of this point in time by preparing the markets for greater policy flexibility.  That is, we could change the language of the announcement by following the Chairman’s example in taking out the reference to a measured pace.  In my view, anyway, that would have two benefits.  It would continue the process of removing policy accommodation, and it would focus markets better on the uncertainties of the future."
"36";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Fourth District have been gradually improving across a broad range of industries this year, and business confidence appears to be strengthening as well. Actually, it feels good to no longer be a Beige Book outlier. [Laughter] As it turns out, I am also not a Greenbook outlier.  I find myself in broad agreement with the staff’s baseline projection. I know I should feel comfortable being in such good company, but I view the projection as the result of competing risks.  Both the Greenbook and my business contacts are bringing to my attention the positives associated with productivity growth and the negatives associated with price increases. Although the rate of structural productivity growth might slow somewhat over the next few years, in my view the decline in the Greenbook multifactor productivity projections seems a little steep. The productivity growth surprises of the last couple of years may persist a bit longer. Business executives that I talk to tell me that they are still very focused on looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and that their capital investments are designed to achieve that goal.  The drive for efficiency has become even more pronounced for those companies that are grappling with large increases in energy prices and in the prices of other raw materials.  And, of course, many companies continue to experience large increases in medical care costs, adding to the incentives to wring out labor costs and other costs. The prospect that productivity growth may exceed the Greenbook baseline gives me some optimism about the inflation outlook at a time when the headline inflation numbers keep escalating. Yet the factors driving the price level up do not seem to be going away.  Energy prices, as we’ve commented, have ratcheted up again.  And, as multiyear contracts with energy suppliers roll off, many companies continue to face increases in the prices they have to pay.  The same situation exists, March 22, 2005 37 of 116 and also intermediate products.  In addition to these factors, there is also the possibility that past dollar depreciation could show up in the form of higher prices of both imported and domestic products. The anecdotal information that I have been receiving about pricing has taken on a different tone from last year.  Last year, retailers like Wal-Mart and Home Depot would not accept price increases from their suppliers.  But the dam seems to be showing some cracks.  Recently, I heard from the CEO of a global company that supplies the big-box retailers with adhesive products, such as duct tape. He told me that during a recent meeting with Wal-Mart he explained that he was requesting a price increase. He was told that they weren’t accepting any price increases and that they would go to his competitors.  Three days later he received a call from Wal-Mart saying that they were going to purchase these supplies from him at the price increases he requested because his competitors had also asked for a price increase. Also, a large manufacturer of capital equipment who supplies the adhesive industries, among others, told me that he can get price increases for his equipment even though his costs are not rising that dramatically.  But because the businesses he is supplying are able to pass on price increases, they are willing to take a price increase from him.  So it seems that, at least in this industry, it’s more than the adhesives themselves that are beginning to stick.  [Laughter] All things considered, I do think that the pricing environment over the next year or so will be very challenging for companies.  I see some evidence that price pressures have been building, yet, if businesses are successful in maintaining strong productivity growth, these pressures might be held in check. The Greenbook illustrates the tension between these two factors and, as I said, I can find March 22, 2005 38 of 116 I think our strategy of gradually removing our policy accommodation has convinced the public that we are determined to keep inflation in check over the long term.  It will be important for us to earn that same degree of confidence as we go forward and as resources in the economy become more intensely utilized.  Although I’m concerned that the possibility of inflation creep over the next year is there, the risks still seem balanced to me as long as we continue to remove our policy accommodation at a measured pace and do so for the foreseeable future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"37";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Little has changed in the Twelfth District economy since we last met.  It has continued to expand in line with the nation. For that reason, I’ll focus my remaining remarks on the national economy. The data we have received since late January have been remarkably consistent in their upbeat message.  Important indicators from the output side—employment in manufacturing production, in particular—gained strength over the past couple of months.  The same can be said of most of the major components of domestic demand.  The strength in orders and shipments for core capital goods, despite the expiration of partial expensing, was particularly significant. In the Greenbook, all of this good news appears to show up mostly in the form of higher interest rates that offset the upward pressure on growth in the second half of this year and in 2006. Developments that bear on productivity have also been heartening.  First is the recent upward revision to fourth-quarter productivity growth as well as estimates of continuing strength for the current quarter. Second, enhanced prospects for business investment in equipment and software bode well for productivity in the future. Finally, some of the signs of slowing in IT [information technology] investment that were worrisome last year have moderated, although there is still reason for some caution about the outlook.  IT investment bounced back in the fourth quarter, and production of high-tech industries has been strong in recent months.  Taken together, these developments helped to assuage concerns about a pronounced slowdown in productivity growth, and I remain optimistic that advances in this area will continue to boost output growth and restrain inflation. Of course, there are always risks. Developments in oil markets are an obvious one, and bond rates are another concern. It is striking that, until recently, long-term rates were falling a bit, even as March 22, 2005 42 of 116 June when the Committee first raised the funds rate, and this has led to considerable discussion of whether term premiums have fallen to levels that are lower than can be justified by fundamentals.  If the term premium is abnormally low now, economic growth could be significantly dampened if the term premium suddenly returns to more normal levels.  And the risks here are nicely illustrated by an alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  For this reason, the low level of long-term interest rates constitutes a downside real risk to the staff forecast. Our staff decided to examine this issue more closely.  We looked at several model-based approaches to explaining and estimating the term premium for 10-year Treasuries.  All of the approaches predict a lower average premium since at least 2001, compared to the average for the 1990s. This result appears consistent with a number of macro developments, including reduced volatility in interest rates, output, and inflation. So a portion of the paradox of why bond rates are so low may be that the term premium has declined for reasons that are justified by fundamentals. The element of risk for the outlook arises because the approaches we examined suggest that the term premium is even lower than is justified by fundamentals.  According to our estimates, long- term rates still remain 30 to 60 basis points below the fundamentals-consistent level, even after the run-up in long-term yields since the last FOMC meeting.  Since our previous meeting, the 10-year bond rate has risen by just under 40 basis points. Using the approach that yielded the larger term premium conundrum, our analysis suggests that about one-third—about 12 basis points—of the intermeeting increase is due to the correction of the low term premium.  The remaining two-thirds is split between a higher path for expected future short-term real interest rates, presumably due to strong economic news, and higher inflation expectations.  The latter concern is reflected in an increase since late January in inflation compensation, especially over the next few years.  Part of this March 22, 2005 43 of 116 prices. Our analysis suggests that oil developments might have raised 10-year inflation compensation by less than 0.1 percent. To sum up, our estimates suggest that the term premium has probably increased moderately, about 12 basis points, since our last meeting.  But even so, the premium may remain as much as 60 basis points below normal, according to our estimates.  Our analysis thus suggests that the risks for the term premium on bond rates are asymmetric.  While the Greenbook expectation of a relatively flat path for bond rates through the end of next year may be a reasonable modal forecast, I don’t think the risks here are balanced. And, indeed, they seem to be on the side of restraint for demand. Of course, the recent news on inflation, and, in particular, the core PCE in January, was disappointing. And with oil prices rising further, it seems reasonable to raise the core PCE inflation forecast through 2006 by a tenth or two, to just over 1½ percent. But I do not think we should overreact to January’s adverse inflation data, especially in light of the continued containment of wages and salaries and evidence of even greater strength in actual and structural productivity growth than previously assumed in the staff forecast. In my view, the policy situation has changed notably since the last meeting.  We now see stronger momentum in aggregate demand, importantly due to more robust investment spending and slightly disappointing inflation data. This means, as is implicit in the Greenbook forecast, that we now appear to be further from the real short-term neutral funds rate than previously, and monetary policy remains quite accommodative. What I would like to see today is for us to raise the funds rate by 25 basis points and retain both the “measured pace” language and the characterization of policy as accommodative.  At present, I believe the Greenbook path and market expectations are quite well aligned and coincide March 22, 2005 44 of 116 term “measured pace” remains a good description of the likely path, and I would think it wise to act to confirm market expectations today rather than upset them.  I don’t think that retaining the “measured pace” language eliminates the Committee’s flexibility to raise the funds rate by 50 basis points if it does prove necessary. Obviously, such a move would need to be justified by the strength of incoming data, but with those data I believe the markets would have adjusted to the idea by the time it became appropriate to implement it."
"38";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050322meeting.csv";" I have no humor in my statement and nothing that differs from the consensus.,  Careful. [Laughter]  The near-term outlook appears more favorable to us, as it does to everybody else. We have moved up our forecast to reflect stronger­ than-anticipated underlying growth and somewhat greater price pressure.  On the expectation that we will move the fed funds rate up at the somewhat steeper path now priced in the market, we now expect real GDP to grow at a roughly 4 percent pace in real terms this year before moderating to around 3½ in 2006. And with this tighter monetary policy assumption, we expect core PCE to come in a bit above 1½ percent but not above 2 percent. As this implies, we are very close to the Greenbook on the broad outlines of the story and quite close in the components, too.  We have a bit more investment and less consumption and a little March 22, 2005 54 of 116 growth and unit labor costs a bit softer. But overall we have a very similar view to the staff forecast on the broad forces supporting the expansion. And we are quite comfortable, as a result, with the case this story presents for tightening policy further and for signaling more tightening to come. We see the risks as roughly balanced around this slightly higher path for growth and inflation. If there’s a case for asymmetry or less balance in our uncertainty, it seems more likely to be on the upside than on the downside. The rise in the two- to five-year inflation expectations in TIPS, in the face of what is otherwise reasonably encouraging news on inflation fundamentals, bears careful monitoring.  We now face a lower probability that the core PCE will come in at 1½ percent rather than above, and this itself suggests a higher path for the nominal fed funds rate. The anecdotal stories seem to have improved alongside the strengthening of private forecasts. Our Empire State Survey shows greater confidence—greater optimism about the next six months—than we’ve seen in some time.  I think we should be relatively comfortable, therefore, with both the direction and magnitude of the change since our last meeting in market expectations regarding the likely path of the fed funds rate. I would be somewhat more comfortable if the market were pricing in a somewhat higher probability of a 50 basis point move at some point in the near term.  I say this not because I think we can make the case now that we will need to move by 50 basis points any time soon but simply because we need to make sure that we have the flexibility to do so. One of the consequences of the structure of our statements these days, at least until very recently, is that the markets have responded to stronger data or more inflation risks by raising the probability of another 25 basis point increase beyond the next meeting or two, but not by pricing in any significant probability of a steeper slope than 25 per meeting.  This has contributed to a remarkable reduction in uncertainty about monetary policy expectations, which in turn has March 22, 2005 55 of 116 premia across financial markets.  Part of this is due to fundamentals, but part seems due to our monetary policy signal. At the margin, this implied ceiling on the slope of the path toward equilibrium raises the possibility that we will be perceived at some point as taking some risk of getting behind inflation expectations. Buying some insurance against this prospective small cloud on our credibility is prudent risk management.  This argues for adjusting our statement to condition or qualify “measured,” and for doing so ahead of when we might be forced to.  This makes sense even if we don’t want to significantly steepen the implied path at this point.  Buying this flexibility now may entail some modest steepening in the path, but some risk in that direction is worth it.  The additional benefit in gradually exiting from the “measured pace” language as we approach equilibrium, of course, is that it will prepare the ground for a flatter path when that proves appropriate. Greater confidence in the sustainability of the main forces driving the expansion suggests that the greatest risks to the forecast, apart from some shock, still lie in the imbalances we face in our economy.  Those imbalances are evident in the combination of the sustained rise in household debt, the projected increase in public debt, and the deterioration in our net international position. This probably argues for trying to get the real fed funds rate up to a more positive level than might otherwise have seemed appropriate.  That will help provide more traction—or at least some traction, since we don’t see much traction yet—to the process of adjustment, allowing the forces of gravity to contribute to a more gradual unwinding of these internal and external imbalances and reducing some of the risk in the forecast. A more contractionary fiscal policy stance would make this less necessary, but this does not now seem in prospect.  Thank you. March 22, 2005 56 of 116 [Coffee break]"

"40";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Like everyone else, I’ve noted with some concern both the incoming evidence of a soft patch with respect to growth and a rough patch with respect to inflation. However, I also believe that the Greenbook has taken these incoming data on board with the usual wisdom and aplomb that I would expect from the staff.  I, therefore, think I can easily support the baseline as being a reasonable basis for policymaking today. Having said that, I’m also quite certain that the baseline will be wrong; I just don’t know in which direction. As many have already pointed out, the range of risks is really quite large.  I would say that if one looks at the alternative simulations, one can see many of the elements of those risks. Given the fact that I’m the last speaker, I will not go through a recitation of the data.  Instead, I’m going to move to the implications of that. First, I think the outcome of today’s meeting is in some sense a foregone conclusion. Anything other than a move of 25 basis points would be folly, and I don’t think we want to go down that path. Second, with respect to what we say today, a number of people have raised some questions about whether or not we should keep the word “measured” in our description.  Frankly, given the range of uncertainties that we are facing now, to do anything other than to say that policy will be moved at a measured pace, I think, would create more uncertainty than certainty.  So inertia in terms of the language might well be a smart move. Thinking beyond that, though, to the rest of this year and focusing a bit more on strategy, I note that the markets have now marked down their expectation of where the fed funds rate will be toward the end of the year and much of next year to a number close to 3.75 percent as opposed to 4 percent. That leads me to think about exactly what has been driving the unusual data we have seen May 3, 2005 70 of 116 two reasons for the softness in the recent data: one is higher energy prices, and the second is that the tightening of monetary policy may have taken a greater toll on the economy than we had anticipated. Many have already explored the energy price issue and its implications for inflation.  Let me now go to the other side, which is the question of whether or not the tightening of monetary policy has had a greater toll on the economy than we had expected.  This obviously is another way of saying that the equilibrium real interest rate is somewhat lower than we might have thought previously, and I’d like to explore that possibility. I think the markets clearly have the view that the equilibrium rate or the neutral rate may have come down somewhat.  The Bluebook table indicates that the TIPS-consistent measure on a core PCE basis would put the medium-run equilibrium real rate at about 2¼ percent.  Obviously, we cannot observe the rate that would be called for to keep the economy growing at potential without inflationary pressures, but perhaps we can approximate this unobservable by looking at the long-run averages. The average real rate during the period 1991 to 2000 was about 2¾ percent. Thus, the market seems to be signaling that the equilibrium real rate has come down to a level about 50 basis points below what it was in the last decade. David in his remarks indicated that there is obviously a wide band of confidence around that, but it may be somewhat lower as well as potentially somewhat higher. So let’s look at the question of why the rate might be lower or why it is that the market and the Greenbook might be right to suggest that the trajectory for the rate might be somewhat lower than we had thought earlier. I think we all know the litany: the restraint imposed on domestic consumers from the increase in the cost of energy, the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make May 3, 2005 71 of 116 these factors represent forces that are pulling the equilibrium rate down below its perceived long- term rate. So what are the facts? First, with respect to the first explanation on energy prices, the staff yesterday showed us a simulation that indicates that the run-up in oil prices since December 2003 may have taken ½ percentage point off growth in 2004 and ¾ percentage point off growth this year. I have nothing to add to the simulation, but it clearly suggests that there is some damping of domestic demand that’s coming from these high and consistently high energy prices. Let’s go to the second point, which is the issue of business hesitancy. It’s certainly true that equipment and software spending has been growing relatively strongly.  However, by historical standards, both nominal high-tech and non-high-tech E&S [equipment and software] expenditures as a share of GDP are somewhat lower than average.  I don’t have the exact numbers, but as a rough approximation it seems as though non-high-tech spending has accounted for somewhere between 5½ and 6 percent of GDP since 1980, and now accounts for something lower—close to about 5 percent. High-tech spending has also been trending up for some time, but perhaps it should be about 4¼ percent of GDP now and it’s actually about 3¾ percent. These are obviously rough estimates, but they all suggest that there has been a lingering drag on investment following the 1990s. The third explanation for why the real equilibrium rate may be somewhat lower, obviously, is the drag from trade.  That topic has already been well discussed. I won’t add much more except to say that in a recent discussion with the ECB [European Central Bank], their policymakers seem to have some concern that the risks to their economic growth are primarily to the downside, suggesting that we should not expect a pickup in demand for our exports overseas. So the question then becomes this:  If, indeed, the markets are right and we are closer to the May 3, 2005 72 of 116 wrong?  I realize I’m trying to do something here that Gary suggests we can’t do, which is to achieve a brilliant policy, exquisitely executed. But if we aren’t able to achieve that, what happens? I asked the staff to run a rough simulation from FRB/US to see what would happen if we continue to raise rates 25 basis points today and at each of the following four meetings—in June, August, September, and November.  That simulation suggests that we would wind up at the end of 2006 with real GDP growth down at about 3.1 percent, the unemployment rate would have risen to about 5.5 percent, and core PCE inflation would have fallen to 1.6 percent versus the 1.7 percent in the Greenbook baseline. I don’t have a longer-run forecast, but I would expect that over a longer time horizon we’d find inflation trailing off even more. The reason I’ve gone through the simulation is to suggest that as we think about the rest of this year, we should probably take on board the fact that while we have to continue to tighten—as both the market and the Greenbook suggest—this concept of measured pace is very, very important. And the issue of exactly when and where we stop is also quite important.  To put it another way, while I’m comfortable with the strategy for today, I think we’re really entering the neutral zone. And for those of you who are Star Trek fans, you may recall that when you enter the neutral zone that’s when the aliens are most likely to attack.  [Laughter] It is quite clear to me that we have executed one exit strategy, but unfortunately I think we’re entering a mode where we need a new exit strategy from the exit strategy!  [Laughter]"
"41";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" I realize I’m entering an ongoing conversation midstream, but sometimes it may be useful to have a fresh set of eyes and ears to at least give an interpretation of what he or she is seeing. I went back and read the minutes of the last several meetings.  I’m glad to see confirmed, Mr. Stockton, that you do have a sense of humor.  [Laughter] But I do detect something of a noticeable dissonance between the last several meetings and currently in terms of what’s in the Bluebook, what’s in the Greenbook, and the tenor of the discussion. And I’m going to use a baseball analogy to describe how I see the situation from the perspective of the FOMC as a batter at the plate. It seems to me that over the course of the last many meetings this Committee saw a fairly consistent delivery from the pitcher’s mound.  These were fast balls that came right across the middle—in the strike zone between the knees with 1 percent inflation and the letters with 2 percent inflation. It was the predictable pitch coming down the pipe, as they like to say in baseball.  And you—I can’t say “we” because this is my first meeting—assumed a batter’s stance accordingly and managed to continue to round the bases without creating any imbalances. Now the data and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy has at least changed pitchers, and we’re getting a few curve balls, maybe some knuckle balls, maybe some split-finger May 3, 2005 39 of 116 stance or keep what worked for the fast ball pitcher who has been on the mound for the last seven innings?  And unlike you, Cathy, I’m going to save that discussion until the second part.  But I do want to address myself to the kinds of pitches we see coming across the plate in the Eleventh District and also nationally and globally. Sitting where I’m sitting and looking at that map on the wall, of course, the District is probably drawn in relative scale to the egos of my fellow country people.  But as the second largest manufacturing state, the second largest in terms of employment in the high-tech sector, and a major transshipment point with significant retailing activity, I think there may be some proxy value in our District’s performance.  So I just want to report that, whereas before we were lagging the economy, we seem to have caught up with the pace.  We think economic activity in our region grew at around 3 percent in the first quarter. Manufacturing activity in general in the Eleventh District, and high-tech manufacturing in particular, has picked up in pace. There has been a notable improvement.  As for energy-related activity, which is a stereotype for our District—we do have oil—the best way to summarize it is the way one of our contacts summarizes it:  If you can pass a drug test and you can speak Spanish, you can get a job in the oil sector. There are a lot of price pressures from the standpoint of employment. However, in the petrochemical sector, we haven’t had any reports of pass-through activity in terms of pricing power, and I don’t think that is unimportant.  And we are not hearing reports of increased pricing power generally from our retailers and others—other than for accountants because of Sarbanes-Oxley. Now, I don’t know how good a proxy that is. We’re a very open economy.  I don’t know what the output gap of Texas is, for example; it’s a very porous economy.  But this is confirmed by our contacts with larger global operators.  And against my background, having spent May 3, 2005 40 of 116 particularly with the railroads—I’ve taken advantage of that to reach out and try to get a feel to see how it corresponds with what we’re seeing locally. We’ve had a couple of confirming impressions. On the domestic economy, there seems to be an expectation of a 3 to 3½ percent growth rate, and people are adjusting to that expectation. One of our contacts, the CEO of a company, reminded me that we went through a period in the early 1990s when economists lowered expectations for growth to 2½ percent, and we were very happy to see 3 percent against that set of expectations. He went on to say that now everybody is what he called “Eeyore”—down in the chops about growth that’s not 4 percent. But in his view, 3½ percent, and I quote, is “darn good growth.” On the energy sector, one can’t get a better view than from the companies that operate in our state, the large transnational companies, and if you’ll forgive me, from a dinner we had last Sunday night with those CEOs and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia. It was a small group that met to discuss what they thought was going on in energy prices, for what it’s worth.  And it’s a fairly good source, I think. In terms of current pricing, the discussion at the table focused on the fact that some percentage of that pricing is due to financial and speculative activity. As summarized by the CEO who will remain unnamed but who runs the largest oil company in the world, the market seems to be pricing in a supply disruption some time this winter.  To quote him, “For the life of me, I cannot figure out where it’s going to come from and the degree of pricing, but it’s not insignificant.” Another company estimated that the amount being priced in for financial speculation and potential disruptive activity is somewhere around $10 a barrel.  But a key point is that the chemical guys are not finding it easy to pass on cost increases at the national level or at the international level either. In addition, there is sufficient refining capacity for current production levels and not a great May 3, 2005 41 of 116 They’re not able to pass on increases. Neither are the retailers. One retailer noted that an abrupt halt to sales of household goods took place in March, which his firm thinks was driven by the slowdown in new housing starts. One of the nation’s largest retailers, which is continuing to build its capacity to source in China, reports that price pressures in constructing new stores is significant because of higher prices for the materials that are going in—steel aggregates and so on.  But as to what they sell, and I quote, “Prices have not risen; they’ve just stopped falling. We can’t discount aggressively without hurting our margins and we don’t have the leeway to raise prices.” And one last input from the CEO of one of the nation’s largest railroads, and by the way the CFO of one of the largest air shippers: their shipments are geared significantly to transoceanic trade. The nation’s largest railroad reported to us that they’ve seen a 21 percent growth this last quarter in their international business. That is particularly geared toward the trans-Pacific trade, and through this lens it appears that our manufacturers and retailers are expecting to continue significantly boosting their investments for sourcing in China.  As one of them said, they are ramping up their spending in China and continuing to arbitrage labor with China. From this and our international contacts—mine by the way ended abruptly and happily on March 31 when I joined this organization, for which I’m grateful—we infer that the effects of globalization on our assumptions about resource slack and the constraints on the economy and the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment have yet to run their course. Thank you."
"42";"MR. GRAMLICH.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The short-run monetary choices are getting harder. While the world oil market is suffering a demand shock caused by rapid growth in China and elsewhere, it affects the economy as a supply shock, with simultaneous worsening of inflation and unemployment.  Many of us lived through just the reverse of this in the late 1990s, with simultaneous improvement in inflation and unemployment.  For us, turnabout is fair play. But while it may be fair play, the choices get harder.  Does one look at the inflation numbers and tighten up or at the unemployment numbers and loosen up?  The answer depends, I think, on whether the medium-term impact on inflation or unemployment is likely to be stronger and more pervasive. As the numbers came in over the past six weeks, initially I was on the hawkish side, worried that inflation would come loose from its moorings.  In terms of Vincent’s Bluebook rhetorical chart [exhibit 6], I found myself over in column C somewhere looking for ways to tighten the statement to express more inflation concern.  But as time went on, the dribs and drabs of steadily worsening data have shifted me over to where I am now, which is somewhere in column A, wanting to ease our rhetoric moderately.  Given the enormous amount of accommodative policy that we have put in and May 3, 2005 62 of 116 meeting.  And I guess I’ve been to too many meetings of this sort to suggest major changes in our rhetoric. [Laughter] But I would like to lobby for at least some elements of column A in the statement.  The reasons for my change should be fairly apparent.  As the Greenbook notes, the spending data have been consistently weak over the last six weeks. The first-quarter GDP report was below expectations in a way that is likely to last. Not only was GDP overestimated, but final sales were overestimated by even more.  So the future forecast should be scaled down to reflect the lower final sales momentum and perhaps additionally because there might be something of an inventory overhang. In terms of spending components, there has always been a likelihood that consumption growth would slow as personal saving rates keep dropping to historic lows.  And it was always likely that saving rates would revert to more normal, higher levels, slowing consumption growth. The wealth–income ratio was held up by house prices, and it, too, could revert to more normal levels, further slowing consumption growth.  Consumer confidence has been dropping for a while now. On the whole, it is quite reasonable to project that consumption will grow less than income for the next few quarters, repressing income growth. Fiscal policy appears to be roughly neutral over the forecast horizon. I note that the Congress did pass a budget agreement that seems to contain at least moderate fiscal tightening. Whether this fiscal tightening will actually come to pass is still an open question, but we will probably not get much new demand impetus from the fiscal side or from the foreign side.  Some parts of the world are growing well, but many of our trading partners are experiencing slowdowns of May 3, 2005 63 of 116 declines sharply, there may be enough dislocations around the world that export growth could still sputter. This means that over the medium term unusual importance attaches to capital investment.  In the staff’s own words, in the data report we got, business fixed investment rose at a rate “well below” that in the fourth quarter; “spending on equipment and software decelerated and spending on nonresidential structures declined.” I might add that durable goods orders are down sharply. Housing starts are down, and the ISM [Institute for Supply Management] index of factory activity is down. The stock market is sluggish despite pretty decent earnings reports, and measures of small business confidence have plummeted. Even though this is a lot of data, I do think it’s too soon to tell if there’s a pattern here, but it wasn’t so long ago that we were worried about an investment pothole.  Maybe we just got the timing of that a little wrong; with sluggish aggregate macro time series, that can easily happen, I think.  Or there could be some other source of impending weakness in investment.  It seems as if around this table about every eight months we get worried about a lack of corporate animal spirits.  I don’t know what the answer is, but I do think that, if investment flags, there is no other obvious source of spending strength. Granted, as Gary says, the economy has shown a lot of resilience, but the spending still has to come from somewhere. As I said before, it is intrinsically difficult to conduct monetary policy when both objectives are turning the wrong way, but in the medium run I’m going to differ with many of you in at least raising the possibility that the weak spending data may trump the strong price data.  Many of the price increases seem to be one-shot increases due to energy shocks and unlikely to pass through into continuing inflation. We talk about the core index, but the core index doesn’t purge all influence of May 3, 2005 64 of 116 important to keep our eye on wages, and wages have continued to be moderate, indicating that price pressures do seem to be contained for the longer run.  And as many of us have noted over time, if aggregate demand does weaken, output gaps will fail to close and overall price pressures should wane. So what should we do about all of this?  In the short run, I’ll go with the crowd. We have invested so much in advertising a climb in rates that we can’t back down now.  For the medium run, however, I’m beginning to get worried on the negative side.  At this meeting, I would like to shade our rhetoric toward the A column in the Bluebook.  I guess the only other thing I could say is that I’d like to recommend that over the next six or eight weeks everybody study carefully the simulation that the staff labeled ""Sentiment slump with financial spillover.""  [Laughter]"
"43";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I interpret what is characterized as softness in some of the recent data releases as an indication that at least the risks to the path of real output growth, which has averaged 3½ percent since the end of the recession and 4.3 percent over the last eight quarters, may have increased.  It’s my sense that both consumer and business confidence may still be a bit more fragile than we thought, and it seems most likely that the skittishness is more due to the uncertainty about high energy prices and their likely persistence rather than a reaction to higher interest rates. Recent data and the anecdotal reports I hear from our Southeast business leaders, from both large and small companies, seem to suggest some new caution when it comes to spending and hiring decisions. A director who is a senior level executive of Georgia Pacific Corporation says that recent box sales, which track consumer nondurables fairly well, have tapered off slightly, whereas another director, who is Chief Financial Officer of UPS, reports that business is steady but not spectacular. At a meeting of our Small Business Advisory Council two weeks ago, there was a near consensus among those in the non-services sector that persistently high energy prices were taking a toll on profits and were causing some capital spending plans to be put on hold.  Obviously, the earnings May 3, 2005 35 of 116 Furthermore, the large gains in temporary employment may be indicative of reluctance to add full- time employees unless absolutely necessary. Despite the increased uncertainties, however, I view the most likely path for output, as does the Greenbook, to be near or even above potential and, as such, unlikely to require attention from monetary policy.  I’m a bit more concerned about the recent price developments which, while not alarming, have now given us several months of upward tilt to measures of inflation—regardless of the index one prefers. The price pressures we see in our region, while mirroring the general upward drift reflected in the national data, are still uneven, with some intended and actual price increases becoming more widespread and sticking and others being greeted with resistance.  For example, our Georgia Pacific executive reported that for the last two months attempts to get price increases on many consumer products were meeting with less success than was the case in late 2004.  He indicated that his customers now were more aggressively playing suppliers off against one another.  At the same time, he reported that the prices of building materials were now clearly reflecting the higher energy costs involved in their production. Residential construction in Florida remains white hot, with continuing concern about speculation in those markets as I’ve been reporting for a while now.  And just two days ago, one of our former directors from central Florida reported that one of the area’s largest contractors was told that concrete was about to go on allocation and to discontinue Saturday deliveries. That same source also indicated that drywall was about to be in short supply again. At the same time, our staff’s work on disaggregating the CPI inflation data indicates that the largest contributors to increased inflation have come mostly from factors other than the pass-through May 3, 2005 36 of 116 the rental equivalence measure for housing.  Over the past six months, the negative contribution to inflation from goods has been reversed, more clearly exposing the underlying trend in services inflation, which has been rising at nearly 3 percent for the past year. In short, the various price and real-side data, tempered with anecdotal reports, lead me to the assessment that, while the risks to the real-side economy have clearly increased, the risks to inflation are now clearly to the upside and policy remains accommodative.  Markets are expecting another 25 basis points of tightening today, and this seems to me the right path for us to be on.  Having said that, I conclude that, with the increased uncertainty about the real economy, we need to think hard, very hard, about just how much we really know and what to say about the path of policy going forward. Like President Minehan, I suggest that it might be time to let some of the policy uncertainty show through. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"44";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, I’ll start off by repeating the obvious:  There have been a couple of surprises since our last FOMC meeting.  The economy has lost momentum after the end of May 3, 2005 47 of 116 the first quarter has led me to join others in marking down my forecast for growth this year to about 3½ percent. I expect growth in the second half of this year to be about 3¾ percent and then slow perhaps back to 3½ percent next year. With trend growth of about 3¼ percent, the output gap and labor market slack should continue to diminish, as we’ve said before. I would agree with those who attribute much of the slowdown to the persistence of higher energy prices. This is especially the case for consumer spending and confidence, as we see it. Higher energy costs have also reduced growth in other countries, and I think that probably has contributed to some of the worsening in our trade balance. Obviously, we need a little more time and information to determine whether the recent economic performance reflects temporary factors or is likely to be more permanent.  If it is temporary, then, as energy prices level off or perhaps decline somewhat, I would expect the fundamental forces of growth to take over—those being monetary policy that, in my opinion, remains accommodative and financial conditions that are, perhaps, highly accommodative. I’ll digress here by giving you just one anecdote. I talked recently to an executive of one of our major banks that lends across the nation in some of the hot markets.  He described a condominium deal, a fairly large one, where the construction cost was about $100 million.  The developers had $3 million of equity in the project.  Those who lent $97 million lent those funds on a pro forma sale price that finished out at $140 million.  So there is a lot of speculation, I think, in these markets.  And that is something that we have to take into account. But I also see that the labor and capital markets that we talk about here are strengthening.  So overall I think the evidence is that the economy will improve.  And I would say, from a regional perspective, that the Tenth District mostly provides support for an improving outlook, though I May 3, 2005 48 of 116 including travel and tourism, rose solidly in March and early April, and most retailers said sales were up substantially from a year ago.  In addition, housing activity turned up, following a pause in late 2004 and early 2005 in our region. Housing starts and permits rose solidly in March, and home sales were strong in most of our District’s cities. Still, preliminary data from our manufacturing survey suggest some evidence of a slowdown. In fact, in April the production and shipments indexes both fell.  More worrisome, though, was the large decline in the six-month-ahead production, shipments, and new orders indexes.  This bears watching, since it may suggest a more permanent slowdown than we currently expect. In addition, a number of contacts expressed concerns to us about higher energy prices.  For example, in our April manufacturing survey, some firms said that they were delaying shipments in order to assure full truckloads and thus save on fuel costs.  A few firms also said that they expect to cut back on production due to high energy costs. In addition, some retailers were worried that higher gasoline prices would eventually take a toll on their sales. Of course, for our region, higher energy prices are positive for some of our District’s states, particularly Oklahoma and Wyoming, where we see nearly boom conditions. Turning to the inflation outlook, I do expect to see further increases in core inflation, with core PCE inflation averaging almost 2 percent in 2005 and core CPI inflation averaging 2½ percent, similar to the Greenbook forecast.  However, unlike the Greenbook, I expect core inflation to remain elevated in 2006 rather than to fall back. I take note of the fact that energy price increases may be a rock in the pond, but I think the substantially accommodative monetary policy we have had is more like a boulder. And it is carrying itself forward, which is what we need to be aware of and alert to. We continue to see increases in core inflation.  Whether measured in 3-, 6-, or 12-month May 3, 2005 49 of 116 inflation is now higher than at any time since the second half of 2001.  In my opinion it is above comfortable levels.  Measured from six months ago, core CPI inflation is about 2½ percent and core PCE inflation is above 2 percent. Clearly, some of the increase represents temporary factors—such as the energy prices we keep talking about and the prices of some commodities—and may be reversed. However, I would take note that the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation is difficult to predict, as we talked about earlier, and may be greater than some suggest.  I also believe that there is more to the inflation story than energy prices.  Even if we exclude the two largest quarterly rates, core CPI inflation over the last four quarters was 2 percent, which is significantly higher than core inflation over the previous four quarters. I believe some of the increase is the result of our continued accommodative policy.  We’ve seen inflation rise over the last year in the presence of sizable slack and a rising funds rate. I’m concerned that, with less slack in the economy, we will continue to see higher inflation going forward. In addition, maintaining an accommodative monetary policy poses an upside risk to inflation, with the federal funds rate currently below many estimates of the lower bound of the neutral rate. If we are slow in removing this accommodation, I would be concerned that the increase in core inflation also might be passed through to higher expected inflation. We’re also seeing some evidence of pricing power in the Tenth District, as manufacturers continue to raise their output prices to cover what they’ve referred to as rising costs of energy and other inputs. In addition, the share of our Beige Book retail contacts who reported to us that they were raising prices this time was the highest in the last five years. These are my concerns.  The one other thing I would mention relates to our statement.  I would agree with those who would like to abbreviate our statement today.  Since people are, in fact, May 3, 2005 50 of 116"
"45";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unfortunately, the economic and policy situation became a lot more interesting over the intermeeting period.  We thought we had an emerging inflation problem; the issue was how hard to lean against it.  In the event, core inflation did come in a bit to the high side, but, in addition, economic activity was appreciably weaker than I thought it would be, with both consumption and investment falling short of expectations. A greater-than-expected reaction to previous increases in energy prices seems to me the most likely culprit for both the inflation and output surprises. Perhaps the constrained reaction last summer and fall to the previous run-up in energy prices lured us into giving this factor too little weight. People may not change their behavior until prices have been high for some time and they perceive the need to build them into more permanent notions of relative prices and disposable income.  Businesses, in cutting back their hiring and capital outlays, may be reacting to their perception that energy prices were in the process of taking a bigger piece out of household spending or at least to increasing uncertainty about the path of that spending. The tendency for economic activity to be disappointing in several industrial economies in recent months supports the notion of a common global thread and is consistent with the energy price explanation. And on the price side, cost pass-throughs may be easier and more readily accepted by May 3, 2005 59 of 116 I agree with the contours of the staff forecast.  If energy prices remain flat, growth should pick up and core inflation should abate. We’re most likely looking at a downward adjustment in the level of demand and an upward adjustment in the level of aggregate prices, not more persistent effects on growth rates. Fundamentals continue to favor this outcome.  Financial conditions remain quite accommodative and supportive of growth sufficient to resume narrowing the output gap. Foreign demand should also strengthen, as the energy price shock is absorbed. The damped growth of compensation even in the face of higher headline inflation indicates to me that appreciable slack remains in labor markets.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing is still below its long-run average. In this environment, conditions in labor and product markets should help keep a lid on price increases, but the incoming data have elevated the level of uncertainty about the outlook, as many of us have remarked, and raise questions about what accounts for the recent outcomes and suggested skews around this most likely scenario. It’s difficult to identify what, other than energy prices, could be unexpectedly damping demand.  But confidence has eroded, which could intensify and prolong energy-related shortfalls. We can see the decline in confidence in surveys of households and small businesses that we saw yesterday and also in financial markets, where volatility and risk spreads have risen and stock prices have fallen.  Perhaps markets are better aligned with reality, but financial conditions are a little tighter than they have been, and this will restrain spending at least slightly going forward.  The slowdown in the increase in investment spending is especially notable and would be a concern if it were prolonged, since that’s what most of us were counting on to sustain solid growth and declining slack over the next few quarters. The staff has interpreted the recent shortfall as reflecting in some small part more persistent May 3, 2005 60 of 116 High-frequency data, such as initial claims, and early indications of consumer demand in April suggest that the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  But at the least, the recent data point to a greater possibility than I saw at the last meeting that growth will not be sufficient to raise resource utilization as policy accommodation is removed further. On inflation, the decline in both short- and long-run inflation compensation and in financial markets since the last meeting encourages me to think that energy price increases aren’t being propagated through this mechanism.  But the surprises in the core inflation numbers do suggest some continuing risk that inflation won’t be as contained as one might otherwise have expected at given levels of resource utilization. The puzzle here in my view is the character of the competitive environment.  Given slack in resource utilization and high profit margins, I would have expected businesses to have been driven—by competition and desires to expand market share—to absorb more of the cost increases. But businesses clearly remain cautious about expansion, and they have been able to raise prices to maintain very high price markups. From a policy perspective, I think we have a situation that is a bit more balanced than it was at the last meeting.  Financial conditions still seem too accommodative to be consistent with the economy not overshooting the level of its potential once the effects of rising energy prices wear off. We need to be careful that nominal rates keep ahead of the now slightly higher underlying inflation. But a gradual pace of tightening now seems an even better guess than it might have been at the previous meeting, in the sense of being in the center of a distribution of possible rate paths.  And that’s because a less robust economy and a larger output gap than expected should provide some May 3, 2005 61 of 116 As I tried to suggest, I think the distributions around the outcomes for inflation and output have become more skewed, but in offsetting directions with regard to their implications for policy. As we’ve been saying in our minutes and speeches, how the actual path of rates evolves will depend on the data and how some of these puzzles are resolved.  But for now I would keep on our path, and I would let the public know that that’s still our best guess for how we’ll be proceeding. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"46";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" On balance, after hitting a soft patch in March, economic activity in the Fifth District appears to have bounced back somewhat in April.  The improvement was centered in manufacturing and retailing, where modest growth replaced flat activity in March.  Services firms, meanwhile, continued to report the moderate growth we’ve seen over the last several months. District manufacturers suggest that demand generally remained solid, and many indicate that they’ve successfully passed through higher energy and materials costs.  Our shipments and new orders indexes both moved up for April.  Most of our manufacturing contacts say that they do not plan to reduce capital spending in coming months and that they remain reasonably optimistic about future prospects.  The exception to this picture is, as usual, in the textile, apparel, and furniture industries that compete directly with Chinese producers.  They continue to complain of a lack of pricing power, and their capital spending is generally limited to maintaining rather than expanding May 3, 2005 29 of 116 weakens. The wage gains are being reported in higher-skilled industries, however, while it is elsewhere in the sector that workers are being shed. The recent bounce in retail sales in the Fifth District appears to be centered in big-ticket items.  In our April survey, big-ticket sales posted their strongest reading since July 2003. Sharp upticks were registered in retail employment and wages as well.  Housing activity remains solid in our District. Home sales are strong in most areas and quite robust in some, including my own neighborhood where I received six offers in one day on my house! On the inflation front, our April survey suggests that price pressures remain contained, though the rate of increase in prices paid by manufacturers edged higher.  We continue to hear concerns about having to pay higher energy prices, and a few producers also complain that higher energy costs are dampening consumer demand. Turning to the national picture, the data we’ve received since March have been disappointing on both the real side and inflation. The slowing in the real side has been broad-based, and although it has been relatively mild overall, the deceleration in capital spending is particularly disappointing given the expectation that business investment would generally drive this expansion. On inflation, core PCE inflation continues to move up.  The latest report shows it at a 2.9 percent annual rate over the last three months, considerably above the 1.7 percent rate over the twelve months to March.  If this situation were to persist, it would present a classic dilemma for monetary policy: weakening real growth and rising inflation. At this point, however, there are good reasons to think that it will not. First, the economic fundamentals underlying this recovery appear sound.  Prospects for growth in real household income look good, and, although capital spending may not soon replicate last year’s strong pace, investment May 3, 2005 30 of 116 should be temporary.  The Fifth District reports of a rebound in April that I mentioned earlier are consistent with this view as well. Second, weak real data did not change the Board staff’s estimate of potential output.  Instead, the Greenbook forecast has a more protracted narrowing of the output gap, with a significantly wider gap still near 1 percent to the end of 2006. It seems reasonable to believe that this wider output gap will help push core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] inflation back below 2 percent, and this view gets some support from the gratifying fact that TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] inflation compensation has declined a bit since March, both for the first five years out and the five years after that.  Moreover, market participants expect inflation to remain that well contained even with about ¼ percentage point less of expected tightening by the end of 2006 than had been foreseen as of March. That raises the likelihood that actual and expected inflation can be contained without the aggressive type of funds tightening that has been needed to do so in the past. One might think that with eight weeks to go until the next meeting and with the possibility of the soft patch expiring soon and removing the dampening effect on out-year inflation expectations, we run the risk of being overtaken by events and rising inflation pressures.  I tend to think, however, that market participants understand our preferences well enough that the yield curve will react sensitively to the data should inflation risks pick up. We should be sure that our communications don’t inhibit that process."
"47";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In our calls this round, we tried to get a sense of the depth and the breadth of the current soft patch and how much of it might be associated with May 3, 2005 26 of 116 District. While the manufacturing sector is still quite robust, there are some hints of slowing orders and the Big Three auto manufacturers are still hurting. Our retail contacts note that business is a bit softer, but they don’t seem alarmed.  Retailers say that higher gasoline prices are affecting sales.  Middle-income consumers are switching from specialty stores to discounters, and lower-income consumers are cutting back more noticeably. Gasoline prices are depressing the demand for large SUVs, as David mentioned.  I’d add that orders for recreational vehicles are down significantly as well.  But air travel continues to be strong despite higher fares. Business spending continues to be solid. The heavy equipment market is the strongest in years. One manufacturer in this sector said that he was increasing capital expenditures 40 percent this year to alleviate production bottlenecks in existing facilities, though not to build new plants. In contrast, a large diversified manufacturer has started to see some softening in orders in the last few weeks, although business overall remains good. On the price front, the big story continues to be energy. There is now a more pervasive sense that higher energy prices are here to stay. We’re hearing this from the auto industry, from retailers, and from firms in the energy sector.  Nonetheless, a major oil company told us that they remain cautious in their investment planning.  Despite significantly higher spot prices and elevated long-term futures, they’re still using an assumption of $20 a barrel when evaluating new production projects. So it seems that oil prices will have to remain elevated for a longer period of time before the industry becomes willing to expand supply through aggressive long-term investments. In addition to energy, we’re still hearing about cost pressures elsewhere, notably for construction materials, rubber, and plastics.  Some of these pressures may be creeping into May 3, 2005 27 of 116 percent decline in material costs, but their actual costs ended up 3 percent higher, and this year they’re budgeting for another 3 percent increase. Looking downstream, many manufacturers have been able to pass through cost increases, and, in a few particularly strong sectors, firms have even been able to increase margins. With regard to labor costs, a major retailer reported that for the first time in two years they had to offer higher starting salaries for sales associates.  However, our contacts at temporary help firms see wages increasing at the same rate or perhaps a little more slowly than earlier in the year. And union contracts have been restrained. Union wages are flat or coming down, more contracts include lower pay for new hires, and health care costs continue to be shifted to workers. Turning to the national outlook, our best assessment is that price pressures remain a concern and that the current soft patch is not the beginning of a major slowdown in the economy.  With regard to growth, most of the fundamentals remain strong.  Monetary accommodation and the underlying trend in productivity continue to support solid growth.  The claims data suggest a firmer labor market than we saw in March, and I don’t get the sense from my contacts that consumers or businesses are retrenching in a significant fashion. Accordingly, growth should pick up at a pace above potential in the second half of the year. With regard to prices, we expect that higher costs will continue to pass through to the consumer level, boosting core inflation to around 2 percent this year.  But we expect core inflation to stabilize or edge off a touch in 2006, mainly because we don’t think there are broad-based resource constraints. Still, these assessments are uncertain.  We’re not really sure which shocks are most responsible for the soft spot and what their ultimate impact might be on the output gap.  If factors such as increased caution or reduced policy stimulus are the main culprits, then there may be a May 3, 2005 28 of 116 appropriate to remove policy accommodation very gradually, say, along the path that’s embedded in futures prices right now. But we need to do more than that if the weakness largely reflects a reduction in potential output due to higher energy prices. Otherwise we would be accommodating an adverse supply shock and would risk unhinging inflationary pressures. So far, long-term expectations appear to be fairly well anchored, although some measures have crept up slightly in recent months.  If we have a few more months of bad price data, we’ll need a more aggressive policy response to avoid a pickup in long-term inflationary expectations.  For today’s meeting, I think we should continue on our current pace of rate adjustments.  However, the statement should avoid giving the impression that the recent softness in economic activity diminishes the underlying inflation risk.,   That’s unfair. [Laughter]"
"48";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparation for this meeting, I talked with contacts at two large banks. As all of us are aware, bank asset quality throughout all of 2003 and 2004 continually improved to the point where by the end of last year almost all bankers said in their year-end reports that asset quality cannot get better; it has to get worse. Thus far, the announcements that have been made in the first quarter indicate that asset quality did get better.  But I suspect that some of the bankers are looking at the debt spread information and are asking themselves the same question that Dino posed rhetorically:  Is there something behind the data that we need to know?  And both bankers that I talked to independently believed—because they’re in an environment of intense pressure on prices and underwriting standards and in a situation with significant liquidity—that the marginal credits may, in fact, be rewritten.  They are circulating, so we have a slight game of musical chairs going on with marginal credits.  So, with bank asset quality, we May 3, 2005 65 of 116 That said, it is not significant because, with the very strong performance of corporate America in recent years, there is still very little in the way of troubled assets out there, particularly in C&I loans. With respect to today’s meeting, as I read the Bluebook and the Greenbook information, I was struck by the significant contrast with the last meeting.  I was prepared to speak to that in a substantive way until both David and Karen summarized in about three sentences what I would have said in many more.  So I don’t need to go in that direction. But what I was not prepared to speak to until I came in to today’s meeting was the fact that when I compare the Beige Book reports and the comments of the Reserve Bank Presidents, there is not nearly the wide variance that I noted in the Bluebook or the Greenbook. Now, if the information that we gather in Washington is cumulative data that we were able to pick up, albeit with a lag, and we supplement that with the more contemporaneous data that we get from the Presidents, it seems to me that there ought to be a lesson there.  At least we ought to focus on it. In the three-and-a-half years that I have been on this Committee, I don’t remember the information always being identical, but I never remember the Beige Book information lagging the Greenbook data.  So I suspect that we may be closer to a pothole or perhaps even the head fake that the entire Chicago Bulls went for last night when Juan Dixon went up for his jump shot, which he made consistently.,  It has been 17 years, Michael. It has been a long time. I’m inclined to support those of you who have already spoken to the strength of the underlying fundamentals and who believe the output gap is continuing to close slightly.  I think we clearly communicated in the last meeting—and the market interpreted it correctly—our heightened May 3, 2005 66 of 116 I think the information is sufficiently contradictory or unclear that it is difficult to make a positive statement. However, we may choose to do as Susan and Roger and I did in our announcement with respect to the Basel II QIS4 [Quantitative Impact Study] information.  Some of you may know that as we were looking at the QIS4 data, which involved the study of the impact of the new Basel II Accord on the banks, we decided that either the information reflected a wider disparity of risk exposure or that there were some additional fundamental inconsistencies in the underlying data that would require us to postpone the release of our notice of proposed rulemaking.  So we did that. That we simply postpone, actually, would be my first choice for today.  [Laughter] Since that is not really being an appropriate option for us, I would suggest that we not significantly revise the manner in which we have communicated our views regarding the removal of policy accommodation until we get a clearer sense of what the underlying data are telling us."
"49";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with information from my contacts at FedEx and UPS. My contact at FedEx says that they’ve seen no indication at all of any slowing, nor do their customers see any sign of a slowdown.  At UPS, both the ground business and express business are coming in a bit below plan.  Part of the story on the express business, interestingly enough, is that the number of mortgage refinancing documents they’re shipping is way down. [Laughter] Both companies have very impressive expansion plans under way.  For its fiscal year beginning June 1, FedEx has planned a 20 percent increase in capital expenditures.  That plan May 3, 2005 54 of 116 hiring 20 to 25 pilots a month, of whom perhaps five are replacement pilots for those who are retiring. So, both companies have very aggressive expansion plans. My trucking industry contact, on the other hand, says that business is soft. Volume is down 2 percent for April on a year-over-year basis. The intermodal business is down 5 percent, April over April; he notes that it was the first decline ever in the intermodal business in the 15-year history of the company.  And he says that the declines are widespread across the country and across industries. My Wal-Mart contact says that same-store sales are coming in at the low end of expectations. He believes the main reason is that the purchasing power of those in the part of the income distribution that shops heavily at Wal-Mart is simply being drained substantially by high energy prices. I think that’s a familiar story. In almost no case, with scattered exceptions, does anyone report any pressures in the labor market, either on wages or the availability of labor.  The exceptions typically are for those with special skills, like accountants, which we’ve already talked about. Another job category that is in short supply, and has been for a long time, is truck drivers. On the overall economy, I think the recent inflation data—and I’m echoing what a lot of others have said—have been on the high side of expectations and the output data on the low side of expectations. In my view, our uncertainty about the outlook going forward is somewhat greater than it has been. My best guess of a point estimate does match the Greenbook forecast.  I think that’s a good central tendency, but, as I emphasized, my uncertainty on both fronts has been rising.  I think the inflation risk is clearly asymmetric on the upper side.  I’m not so sure that there’s all that much asymmetry on the output side. The fundamentals on inflation appear to be sound.  We have continuing modest wage May 3, 2005 55 of 116 highly inflationary, at least as measured by the aggregates:  M2 growth has been coming in below the growth of nominal GDP; MZM has actually been about flat in the last six months and up 2 percent year over year. So, on the quantity side, I don’t think there’s evidence of a highly expansionary monetary policy.  But I think there are lots of reasons to be nervous about the inflation risks. I would also point out that one of the clearest indications of the increased uncertainty about the outlook is the length of our discussion about the staff’s forecast. Thank you."
"50";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Third District continued to improve in the first quarter, although at a slightly slower pace than in the previous quarter. Retail sales in the region were up slightly in March, with most merchants noting that unseasonably cold and rainy weather dampened sales of spring apparel and other seasonal merchandise.  As in the nation, local auto dealers saw a healthy rebound in sales in March, helped by strong manufacturers’ incentives.  Both retailers and auto dealers expect sales to improve this spring. Payroll employment continued to increase in the region in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate declined.  A large national payroll and benefits administrator in our District reported that in the first-quarter employment growth was stronger at small firms with fewer than 1,000 employees than at large firms.  But the positive growth rate at large firms was an improvement over the zero growth they saw last year. There has been little change in the overall picture in the construction sector. Nonresidential construction in our region remains soft.  As in the nation, there has been a sharp drop in the value of nonresidential construction contracts in the first quarter compared to a year ago.  The residential sector remains strong.  The value of residential construction contracts declined in the first quarter in our three-state region, but remained at a high level.  Home sales and the rate of house price appreciation remained robust. Our business outlook survey indicated that regional manufacturing activity is expanding. We saw a sizable rebound in the general activity index—from 11.4 in March to 25.3 in April— suggesting that the drop in March may have been a random volatility event rather than a signal of a more persistent slowing.  About half of the firms reported that they plan to increase capacity in 2005, May 3, 2005 51 of 116 The most troubling regional economic news is the evidence of increasing price pressures in the District. Consumer prices in greater Philadelphia appear to be increasing at a faster pace than in the nation as a whole. After some moderation in February and March, industrial price pressures increased in April. The price indexes in our manufacturing survey rebounded this month across almost all of the industrial sectors represented and are at very high levels.  However, while the indexes of future prices paid and received have risen sharply over the past two years, in recent months both indexes have stabilized, albeit at relatively high levels.  Also, employment cost inflation in the Northeast region has not accelerated, running at a 3.5 percent annual rate in the year that just ended in March. In summary, the economic expansion appears to continue at a moderate pace in the Third District. This is what we gleaned from the data we have available and it’s consistent with the anecdotal information from our contacts.  During April, I typically travel around the region, holding a series of meetings with our bankers and business leaders.  They’re generally upbeat, with positive outlooks despite the recent negative national economic headlines.  This gives me some confidence that the recent softness in the data will prove to be relatively temporary and is not signaling an economy that is taking on a new direction. My assessment of economic conditions in the nation is similar.  Admittedly, higher oil prices likely are having some dampening effect on economic activity, and recent monthly data have come in softer than expected.  However, this appears to be a temporary lull, as there is little to point to that suggests we are seeing a persistent deceleration in real economic activity.  Last month was reminiscent of the soft patch we hit in June of last year, as President Yellen indicated, after oil prices May 3, 2005 52 of 116 As the expansion continues and the economy approaches a sustainable growth rate, it is to be expected that we will see growth in some quarters above and in some quarters below that sustainable pace. My reading of history suggests that a low quarter or two is fairly typical during the course of an expansion and that some of the concerns based on early measures of economic activity are assuaged by subsequent revisions in the data. The bottom line is that I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that the economy continues to have positive momentum.  This suggests that it is premature to be too concerned that the perceived slowdown will persist and clearly premature to alter our policy path based upon the available new data. Of course, there are downside risks for near-term growth, but there is nothing that monetary policy can do that will affect the real growth in the next quarter or so.  Therefore, I think we should be focusing on a horizon over which monetary policy can have an effect.  In that regard, the acceleration in inflation over the past year is a concern to me, and that sentiment has been echoed around this table. The first part of the increase in inflation was to get us away from the zero bound, but we are now well beyond that. In fact, over the last six months, the inflation rate has been moving up into the top half of my acceptable range.  Of course, these are high-frequency data and the trend still might prove temporary, but it clearly deserves watching. The Board staff continues to forecast some tempering in core inflation over the forecast horizon, but the starting levels of their forecast have been moving up as new data have come in.  The forecasted downward path seems dependent on a good deal of slack remaining in the economy. However, this increase in observed inflation may be evidence that there is less slack than we think. By ignoring the acceleration, we could end up in a situation of having to move rates up more rapidly than we now expect, which could have a negative effect on future growth. So this is certainly not May 3, 2005 53 of 116 That said, I’ve become less certain about the particular speed at which the removal of accommodation should proceed.  If the inflation acceleration continues, a steeper path may be indicated. In the event that the softening of activity turns out to be persistent, a slower pace might be more appropriate. At the last meeting I indicated that I believed the dispersion of likely rate paths going forward was widening. I dare say there was some consensus on this point at the meeting.  Given the recent data, I’d guess that not only is the dispersion around my own expected path wider still but that there is likely to be more divergence in the Committee’s view of it.  Thus, I believe it’s important for us to craft our statement in a way that gives us considerable policy flexibility.  It would also be useful if we could convey some sense that there is less certainty about policy actions going forward. I will not get into the specifics of how to do this until the second roundtable discussion. However, I want to point out that sometimes saying less offers more transparency about the Committee’s view than saying more.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"51";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you. Well, two issues have been weighing on my mind.  They’re really the two issues that Dave Stockton addressed. First, is the recent reduction in the Greenbook forecast roughly appropriate, or will the economy do appreciably worse or possibly significantly better than that?  Second, is the forecast of modest inflation still tenable in the face of the increase in most core measures that we have seen? I must say that I think there is a danger of over-interpreting and overemphasizing a batch of statistics, all of which became available within several weeks in April, given their reliability or unreliability and given that not all of them seemed to me to be a particular surprise.  Still, I wouldn’t totally dismiss them, so I am inclined to reduce my forecast of growth, although it’s perhaps still a bit above the Greenbook projection of 3½ percent. Plus, for what it’s worth, our internal forecasting May 3, 2005 37 of 116 maybe a touch more optimistic than the Greenbook for three sets of reasons: one, the fundamentals; two, the nature of the anecdotes I’ve been getting; and three—and perhaps most importantly— history. As far as the fundamentals are concerned, we have the usual suspects that we’ve been talking about at this table for several years now: continuing comfortable financial market conditions, underlying expansion in productivity, a general lack of supply-side constraints, and still healthy consumer and corporate balance sheets on average. As for the anecdotes, discussions with business leaders in our District and an examination of District economic data for the most part yield positive conclusions.  Manufacturing is clearly continuing to advance, employment is increasing, and labor markets appear to be gradually tightening, especially in areas where mining and energy activity are strong.  Consumer spending activity is continuing to expand, and reports on capital spending and commentary associated with capital spending from directors are really quite strong overall.  All of this is balanced a bit by a note of caution, which has crept in among firms with large exposures in the transportation sector, but I would have to say that the anecdotes preponderantly have really been quite positive. As far as history is concerned, I consider particularly relevant the long expansions of the 1980s and the 1990s. In my view, those expansions were not particularly dependent on good luck nor on astute policies conducted with exquisite precision, although I do believe that policy made a positive contribution. But I think the real lesson of those expansions was that the economy is fundamentally sound, flexible, and resilient.  And I don’t think those traits have been altered or have diminished just because we’re in a new decade.  So that gives me a fair amount of confidence that May 3, 2005 38 of 116 As to inflation, I continue to think that moderate inflation will prevail, with the performance of core prices probably at a pace comparable to that over the last five or six years on average.  Still, there is no denying that core measures of inflation have been increasing persistently since late ’03, and this does give me a bit more concern.  And it makes me a little more cautious than I was formerly about the inflation situation currently and about the outlook for inflation.  Thank you."
"52";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I guess I’m going to repeat a lot of the things that others have said, but I think I will end up in a somewhat different place than some of you around the table in that I’m much more concerned about the risks of inflation than I am about those for the real economy. If we look at the first-quarter data, and more particularly the information that has come out in the last several weeks, we can really see that the quarter started out very strong and that the more recent data showed some weakness.  First-quarter GDP growth at 3.1 percent was much weaker than most folks, myself included, expected.  But if one looks at the components of the underlying data, May 3, 2005 67 of 116 surge in imports—and in government spending.  In fact, private domestic final sales were really quite good in the quarter, growing by my rough estimate at somewhere in the high 3 percent range. So how do we deal with that?  Well, to the extent that the weakness is imports and is coming from strong consumer and business spending, that’s a good sign.  So, while I want to get some more data on what is happening in the real economy, I’m not as pessimistic as some of you.  Monetary policy is still accommodative, if one looks at the liquidity in the banking system.  And while the weaker economic data caused some reaction in financial markets, overall the conditions are very supportive of business expansion and consumer borrowing.  Corporate profits for the first quarter, which are still coming in, seem to show continued strength, and first-quarter earnings growth now looks as if it will be in double digits for the twelfth straight quarter. To me the other remarkable development in the markets is what has happened in reaction to news about compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.  This is the first year-end reporting. Most companies are on a calendar year-end, and a record number of companies have announced that they cannot report in the regular time frame and are doing late filings.  Normally, one would expect this to create a disruption in the market, but the market has been very discerning in the way it has taken the news. Many companies that have reported have had to disclose weaknesses in their internal controls around financial reporting. And based just on the anecdotal evidence, the market seems to be behaving very prudently in that it is distinguishing between companies where the reported weaknesses are isolated in one small area and those where the control weaknesses are more pervasive. So, it appears that the sunshine associated with these disclosures is being handled well in the marketplace.  We’ll see what happens as we go along and those firms that have still to disclose their Sarbanes-Oxley reports do so. I was a little concerned that we might see more volatility in the May 3, 2005 68 of 116 Let me turn now to the inflation issue, which does have me more concerned.  If we look at the lagging indicators, inflation numbers over the last 12 months are still in the mid-1 percent range, depending on what measure we look at.  But one of the things we need to realize is that in the first part of last year inflation rates were very, very low.   If I look instead at inflation measures in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, I get very much concerned about the trend we’re seeing.  If I throw out all of the volatile energy and food components, the way we typically do, and look at core measures, core CPI has risen by 1.3 percentage points to 3.3 percent in the last three months.  Core PCE is up a full point to 2.6 percent. As to where we see prices rising, the big turnaround, as some of you have indicated, has been in the goods sector of the market.  Prices for services continue to be rising by a bit above 2 percent, but goods prices have gone from declining at an almost 3 percent pace at the beginning of last year to being about unchanged now. That is affecting the aggregate numbers and is something we need to watch. The employment cost index in the first quarter did show a slight slowing to 0.7 percent from 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  But as David remarked, this is due to the slowdown in pension funding that occurred in the first quarter. A recent survey of corporate CFOs shows that their number one concern continues to be health care costs. And as they look to pay for the cost of labor going forward, many of them are trying to hold down wage increases because of the significant rise they’re seeing in health care costs. Where this will lead in terms of future hiring is a concern.  It may impact the real economy, because if employment growth continues at the more subdued pace of the last month, it could affect consumption and the real final sales that are giving me confidence in the real sector.  As for the balance of risks, I agree with the comments President Yellen made; I believe the risks of inflation are May 3, 2005 69 of 116"
"53";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  New England and the nation seem to have hit a couple of bumps along the road to steady growth.  We, like the Greenbook, don’t expect the bumps to turn into potholes or disturb much except the speed of travel slightly.  But we were again May 3, 2005 31 of 116 In New England, Beige Book contacts were remarkably upbeat in early April, and available data reported a sense of solid growth in the region. However, several recent indicators and a sense of caution suggest the possibility of an emerging slowdown in the region. On the positive side, employers added jobs in February and March, and the quarterly total was positive as well. Unemployment rose slightly, but this was due entirely to a stabilization in the regional labor force after a period of decline. Unemployment claims moved down, and both the traditional help-wanted index and Monster.com’s index of online job postings increased at a solid pace. As the weather brightened, tourism did as well; and business travel in Boston has been strong, at least relative to last year. With average revenue per room rising at a nearly 13 percent pace, hotels looked poised for a good year. Surprisingly, even in this service industry, productivity improvements are possible, as average hotel staffing reportedly has dropped from 80 per 100 rooms in 2000 to 62 per 100 rooms in 2004.  This is said to be the result of technological change and the growing popularity of online booking. Beige Book contacts in retail and manufacturing were, on the whole, rather optimistic. Moderately growing demand and increased pricing power were keeping margins strong, and a continued emphasis on productivity growth and conservative capital spending left most of our contacts confident of meeting their revenue and profit goals for the year.  Higher costs for oil and oil-related inputs and for certain types of skilled labor were a concern, and many contacts commented on a generally more inflationary business environment.  Indeed, providers of business and strategic consulting services reported strong growth, with one contact stating that cost containment is not as big an issue as it was but that strategic matters were becoming more important. Overall, confidence seemed good, and that was reflected in the various regional surveys of May 3, 2005 32 of 116 doubt about both current conditions and the future. This was likely due to concerns about rising oil prices, as local prices for home heating oil rose at a 14½ percent pace, double the national average, and gasoline prices rose sharply, as they did elsewhere. Residential real estate markets, while still strong, leveled off and softened at high price points. Actually, I think President Lacker is probably not asking enough for his home.  [Laughter] I don’t find that I’m getting as many offers for mine. And a regional index of leading economic indicators pointed to slower growth ahead.  These tentative indications of a slowdown could well evaporate, however, and some moderation in demand may be good, particularly given the stronger pricing environment. Data for the nation have been disappointing in April, both on the demand side and on the price side. The latest news in labor markets is three days away, and while that could surprise on the upside, given recent claims and help-wanted data, the numbers for March were more subdued than we had expected. Equally disappointing were durable goods orders and trends in manufacturing output, though as a partial offset to this I found the April loan officer survey data interesting in that they suggested strength in C&I [commercial and industrial] lending.  Contractions were also seen in retail sales, with and without autos, and in home building, although from a fairly strong base. Advance GDP data suggest unintended inventories accumulated as the first quarter ended, reflecting a slowdown in final demand and a drag from net exports. As in New England, this could well be just a bump in the road.  And given the unwelcome nudging up of core price data, it might be helpful in curbing further inflation.  It does bear watching, however, as we gauge how fast to adjust policy. At this point, my view is that it would be unwise to overreact to the recent indications of softening. They could well be temporary, as many have noted. May 3, 2005 33 of 116 challenges over the past year or so quite important to keep in mind.  Whatever its cause, I think the resilience of the U.S. economy has been a hallmark for at least most of the last decade, and I think we would be wise to keep that in the front of our forecast. Right now, given the uptick in prices, we aren’t making much progress in getting back to some sense of neutral as far as policy is concerned.  Our forecast in Boston and that in the Greenbook suggest that growth will continue at a pace that will use up at least some excess capacity by the end of the forecast period. Recognizing that estimating precisely when an output gap will close is chancy at best, I believe we need to continue to move policy to a point that is not stimulative by the time that gap closes and that doing so gradually will help to ease the impact on the economy. If incoming data continue to disappoint, we may find it necessary to pause along the lines that the fed funds markets expect.  Conversely, upside surprises, particularly on the price front, are also possible. So I would not rule out a faster pace of upward policy movement if circumstances warrant later in this year. The point is, I think, that our vision of the future is now a bit cloudier than it was. That takes me to the real action at this meeting—not so much what we do but what we say about it. I’ve been uneasy with our use of the “measured pace” language because it seems to provide a level of certainty to market participants that could encourage inappropriate risk-taking. Indeed, while risk spreads have widened from their low points, they still remain quite low. However, there has been concern that taking away the “measured pace” language would be disruptive in that it would seem to say only one thing: that policy accommodation would be removed at a faster pace than previously. But weaker-than-expected incoming data may have provided a greater sense of two-sided risk, and that may have offered us a good opportunity.  We may now have the chance to drop “measured” from our lexicon, while preserving the flexibility to take any action May 3, 2005 34 of 116 I think we ought to make the most of this opportunity and get out of what has been perceived as a policy pledge. The economy has become more uncertain.  Our commitment to price stability and maximum sustainable growth continues unabated, of course, but we are less certain about the policy path we will need to take to fulfill those goals.  Let’s go back now to simply saying what we’re doing and why and let the market assign its own probabilities to future policy changes.  Thank you."
"54";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meeting I said that I was happy to report that the Fourth District was no longer an outlier in the Beige Book and that economic activity in the region appeared to be gradually improving.  But that warm glow appears to have been short- lived. Since our last meeting, economic activity in my District has shifted down somewhat, conforming to what we now see in the national economy. In both the Beige Book process and my conversations with business contacts, I’ve been especially keen to elicit information about pricing pressures and the reemergence of pricing power. The tone regarding pricing power also appears to have softened.  Although I still hear that there’s an ability to pass through some higher raw material costs, the majority of my contacts are once again reporting that it is difficult to pass on price increases. My instinct is to be concerned about the possibility of further inflation creep over the year. After all, most of the inflation surprises have been on the upside for quite a while now.  But from my perspective, the issue that we confront is whether to regard the inflation situation as unfortunate but transitory, or unfortunate and persistent. The Greenbook projection treats energy shocks like rocks thrown into a pond. The energy shock creates a ripple that dissipates over time.  The price statistics throughout last year behaved accordingly. When that rock or energy shock entered the pond in 2003, the core rate of inflation initially spiked up but then declined throughout much of the year.  Energy markets threw another stone into that inflation pond last year. Without those energy shocks, my guess is that the Greenbook inflation projections for this year would have held up nicely; and I think the current projections are sensible, barring any more ugly supply shocks.  That is, I think it is reasonable to expect that core inflation once again will drift back down—in the absence of more rocks entering May 3, 2005 46 of 116 energy are problematic.  So this gives me some comfort with the Greenbook baseline inflation projection. But I recognize that inflation dynamics could deliver more persistence than that. Throughout this policy tightening cycle, I’ve been focused on getting the fed funds rate back into the neutral range. When the pace of economic activity appeared to be more robust, I preferred to be in the higher end of that range. However, the incoming data have made me less certain about aiming that high.  And it is possible that the equilibrium real rate of interest could be either notably higher or lower by the time of our June meeting. For now, I still think that a sequence of small incremental increases in the fed funds rate is the most likely course of action in the immediate future.  Nonetheless, greater uncertainty about the outlook for economic activity and inflation does change my view about how policy decisions ought to be communicated.  In my view, the “measured pace” language we’ve been using has served us well. But I think this type of guidance should be reserved for those periods of time when the Committee feels especially confident about what the next few policy actions will be and has reason to believe that its intentions would be misunderstood without that kind of guidance.  I do not think that these conditions are present today. For that reason, I do favor removing the “measured pace” language. If the statement were reflecting my own thoughts, I would also insert some words that convey a greater sense of uncertainty about the outlook for real growth and inflation and, therefore, more uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"55";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It has been less than a year since I returned to the policy table, but already there is a sense of déjà vu all over again. [Laughter] The recent pattern of higher inflation and softer spending seems remarkably similar to the May 3, 2005 42 of 116 prices. The latest data on employment, retail sales, and durable goods orders reveal unanticipated weakness on the real side of the economy.  Readings on overall and especially core inflation have been uncomfortably and unexpectedly high.  If the current situation persists or deteriorates further, we could face some difficult policy choices ahead, but I remain cautiously optimistic that the slowdown in growth and the uptick in inflation will both prove transitory. I believe we can draw some lessons for assessing current conditions and for calibrating policy going forward from last year’s experience.  Last year’s jump in energy prices delivered a significant shock to consumers and businesses.  For a time, the growth of consumer spending slowed and inflation increased. But after the initial jolt, the growth of consumer spending and economic growth overall rebounded. Higher energy prices again have hit consumers hard in the pocketbook and businesses on the bottom line, but there’s good reason to anticipate a similar recovery in spending this year, especially with oil prices having come down of late.  So the lesson from last year’s experience is that we shouldn’t overreact to the present soft patch or short-run fluctuations in real-side data when the fundamentals for growth appear to remain relatively sound. I, therefore, find myself in agreement with the Greenbook’s perspective.  Beyond the current quarter, the forecast has been revised only slightly, with the major components of demand projected to continue expanding at a fairly healthy pace. This forecast mirrors the perceptions of our Twelfth District business contacts who, outside of the Bay Area and Los Angeles proper, report that they remain quite upbeat about the economy. For inflation, last summer’s experience similarly advises a cautious policy reaction to the data. The recent uptick in core inflation probably reflects pass-through of cost pressures due to May 3, 2005 43 of 116 just like last summer, underlying pressures on core inflation appear to remain subdued.  Several of the good fundamentals driving the outlook for inflation are worth highlighting. First, the data surveyed in Part 2 of the Greenbook suggest that at least some, and possibly considerable, slack remains in labor markets.  Corroborating this view, our contacts, even in some of the most rapidly growing areas of the Twelfth District, report little trouble filling job openings except in some skilled trades that are in high demand in construction.  I met recently with top executives of SBC West, a major employer in California and Nevada.  They indicated no difficulties whatever in hiring at any skill level, with only a few exceptions, such as accounting.  Like most of our contacts in the District, they also saw no significant wage pressures.  Indeed, nationwide data suggest that labor cost pressures appear quite restrained. For example, as David noted, last week’s ECI data showed no sign of any acceleration in private compensation. The underlying trend in productivity is also solid, and, as I discussed at a previous meeting, I remain optimistic that it will remain so, in which case unit labor costs are likely to remain constrained. Our contacts report continued scope for productivity improvements.  For example, the SBC West executives with whom we met explained how new technologies permit tasks to be performed via computers at headquarters that in the past required technicians to make service calls. Of course, “pricing power” is a phrase that is used frequently by our contacts, but the mention of pricing power is focused exclusively on pass-through of cost increases due to energy, materials, and transportation.  In construction, agriculture, and transportation, firms report considerable success in passing these cost increases along. In other sectors, the experience has been more mixed.  One director who runs a major clothing retailer reported only limited pass-through to consumer prices in the face of competitive pressures and continued gains in productivity.  With May 3, 2005 44 of 116 Moreover, to the extent that these costs are being passed through to prices, they appear to provide only one-time boosts to the price level. In terms of policy, I support a 25 basis point increase at this meeting and retaining the “measured pace” description of the likely path for policy going forward, at least for today.  Weak real-side data might suggest a pause to evaluate the extent and likely duration of the slowdown.  But incoming inflation data could justify more aggressive action.  Given the latest uncomfortably high readings on inflation, I think we have to remain vigilant.  The constancy of long-run inflation expectations provides some reassurance, although I worry that if we had similar readings on such expectations in the early 1970s, they would have been slow to rise then as well, as bond markets had grown complacent about inflation. Last time, we adopted language that many of us thought made our balance-of-risk statement tautological. In fact, it turns out that the statement is not tautological, and I no longer consider it true. [Laughter] In my view, even with appropriate monetary policy action, the risk to the attainment of sustainable growth is unbalanced to the downside, while the risk to the attainment of price stability is unbalanced to the upside. It is the risk to our dual objectives, but not to each individual objective, that I consider balanced overall. Releasing an unchanged balance-of-risk statement might suggest to some that this Committee has ignored the palpable shift in economic conditions toward higher inflation and slower growth. Indeed, an uncharitable description of the current statement is that it has gone from not serving any purpose to potentially being perceived as factually incorrect. Rather than try to modify the balance-of-risk statement, I think it is perhaps time to retire it, for reasons that I will explain in more detail in the policy go-round. May 3, 2005 45 of 116"
"56";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050503meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We think the fundamentals underpinning a forecast of a reasonably strong expansion with moderate inflation seem reasonably persuasive. However, we are less confident than we were at the last meeting.  On the assumption that we continue to move the fed funds rate higher on a path close to that now in the market, we expect the economy to grow at a 3½ percent rate during the balance of this year and in 2006.  And we still expect core PCE inflation to come in below 2 percent, although just below, over the balance of the forecast period, but we think it will follow a somewhat higher path.  As this implies, we’re very close to the Greenbook projection on the overall contour of the forecast, and we’re close on the components as well. We see greater uncertainty in the forecast, with some downside risk to growth and some upside risk to inflation. We think the probability of inflation coming in higher is greater than the probability that growth will be lower. And, of course, that judgment about the change in relative May 3, 2005 56 of 116 On the growth front, the anecdotal reports we’re exposed to are weaker than they have been. They’re weaker than the national numbers and may imply some further deceleration ahead.  We don’t have much basis for confidence that these numbers tell us much about the future, but the sentiment does seem a bit more fragile.  The fact that confidence seems to have eroded so quickly in the face of a relatively limited period of weaker numbers might itself suggest greater vulnerability to the forecast. Despite all of this, though, we think the near-term fundamentals of the economy look fairly good. The resilience of the recent past seems likely to be durable.  We think the labor market still looks to be on a path of gradual improvement.  Investment growth still seems likely to be pretty healthy, with profit margins high, balance sheets strong, and credit conditions favorable.  We think the factors supporting solid investment growth remain compelling.  And we still are inclined to believe that structural productivity growth is likely to remain strong, which should provide both continued impetus to investment and continued confidence about future income growth.  It’s hard to find other constraints out there that could limit the expansion.  Of course, we still face some risk of an abrupt change in household saving behavior, and the effects of that could be significant. On the inflation front, we’ve been surprised by the extent of the acceleration in core prices and we are a bit concerned about the higher expectations reflected in some surveys.  The economy is growing at a rate that seems likely to be sufficient to continue to absorb remaining slack, unit labor costs have moved up, and we hear continued reports of increased pricing power.  And some measures of expectations at the intermediate horizon—the horizon over which we expect monetary policy can affect inflation—are above the desirable level of inflation.  Accordingly, we see greater risk that inflation will follow a higher path than we are comfortable with.  This seems a prudent view May 3, 2005 57 of 116 has been modest to date—profit margins remain very high, of course—and despite expectations of fairly good future structural productivity growth. The modest widening in credit spreads and the volatility in equity prices we’ve seen recently have been absorbed reasonably well. I’d be inclined to view this modest repricing of risk and uncertainty as welcome and healthy rather than as foreshadowing a deeper, more protracted deceleration. On balance, we believe that monetary policy should continue to be directed at moving the real fed funds rate higher. At our last meeting we introduced a bit more uncertainty into the monetary policy signal by putting in more qualifications about the likely path of monetary policy going forward and about the cumulative amount of tightening.  The overall effect of these changes to our statement was to continue to signal that we think the slope of the funds rate path remains positive, implying, of course, that monetary policy is still too accommodative.  But we also indicated, through these changes to this statement, that we have less certainty about the slope and shape of that path. Long-term measures of inflation expectations moderated immediately following the meeting, and some measures of uncertainty about future rates went up.  And since then, market participants have demonstrated a very significant degree of sensitivity to incoming data—at least in terms of the fed funds path priced into the markets  To me this suggests that we got the balance about right last time.  We bought ourselves the desirable increase in flexibility to respond to a somewhat more uncertain set of conditions going forward, and I think we should try to preserve that balance in our signal today. We need to acknowledge, of course, the moderation in the rate of growth in output and demand we’ve seen and the higher inflation numbers, but I don’t see a good reason to try to alter May 3, 2005 58 of 116 The increased uncertainty in the market about the forecast reflects some greater dispersion in the likely path of the fed funds rate, and I think it suggests little gap between the market’s view and our own view of policy uncertainty going forward. So I don’t see a case for altering the statement significantly today in a way that would introduce a greater degree of uncertainty about monetary policy than is already reflected in the markets at this point.  Thank you."
"57";"CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  President Santomero.,   President Guynn.,   Let’s take a break for coffee.  But owing to what must have been a record question period after the chart show, we’re running a little behind schedule, so let’s return quickly. [Coffee break],  President Hoenig.,   President Minehan.,  President Pianalto.,  President Stern.,  President Yellen.,  President Poole.,   President Lacker.,   Vice Chair.,   Governor Ferguson.,   Governor Olson.,   Governor Gramlich.,  Governor, I don’t recall when anyone got applause. [Laughter]  I think what they were applauding was not necessarily your speech but your character. SEVERAL. Hear, hear.,   Vincent, I hate to put you in a position to follow that. [Laughter]"
"58";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The issues before us at this meeting are two. The first is: Are we going to be dissuaded from the announced strategy of another modest tightening in monetary policy?  And second: Is there palpable need to adjust market expectations of policy going forward? We might be dissuaded, or feel obliged to change market expectations under one of four circumstances; and I will go through each of them in order.  The first is if we thought the baseline forecast itself, which I think is built basically around the announced strategy, was unacceptable.  I find the baseline forecast basically acceptable, although I am somewhat concerned, as are President Lacker and a few others who have already spoken, that the inflation drift seems to be upward.  So I think there is some risk there, but by and large it’s basically an acceptable forecast. The second reason I think we would change strategy or change policy in terms of our announcements is if the incoming data made a basically acceptable forecast seem highly unlikely. June 29-30, 2005 141 of 234 consistent with the baseline forecast.  Consumption is likely to hold up well, as outlined in the baseline, because labor markets do appear to be gradually improving.  As David Wilcox indicated, not only has the unemployment rate edged down a little but, more importantly from my standpoint, the broader indicators of labor market conditions seem to be consistent with improvement. Economic conditions have strengthened enough to bring some individuals back into the labor market, as evidenced by a gradual rise in the labor force participation rate.  There is also a decline in the share of individuals working part-time, for economic reasons, as shown on exhibit 4 in the chart show as well.  And I think the tone in the survey data from both businesses and households has been relatively positive.  Moreover, I continue to believe that low interest rates are likely to support wealth creation in the housing market, as we discussed extensively yesterday, and I have very little concern about a sudden fall-off in that regard.  And, finally, with respect to business fixed investment, I would say though the investment-to-GDP ratio has been relatively low—a point I will return to later—I agree with the assessment in the Greenbook that the fundamentals are at least consistent with ongoing business fixed investment. On the inflation side, I would say that David handled the incoming data well in terms of why one should not put too much weight on some of the data.  The one point that he didn’t touch on was unit labor costs.  They rose quite dramatically in the fourth quarter of last year, but I think the good news is that in the first quarter of this year the increase in unit labor costs on an annual basis, quarter over quarter, seems to have subsided somewhat.  So there may be less inflation pressures in that regard. So by and large, in terms of the second reason, I’d say the incoming data are consistent with a pretty good outlook. The third reason that might force us to change our views is if the market signals indicate that June 29-30, 2005 142 of 234 Vincent and the staff have done I think firmly outlines at least some of the issues.  The fixed-income conundrum has been much recognized.  Additionally, risk premia in the fixed-income universe are also quite low. In the equity markets, I think the signals are somewhat contradictory.  And here I pick up a little from exhibit 8.  One thing that’s not shown there is that the implied share price volatilities of both Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are really quite low, and yet the risk equity premium is relatively wide—toward the wide end of the norm that we’ve seen over the last decade.  So in lieu of decrying these conundra with which we are confronted, let me at least do what Michael wouldn’t do, which is venture a hypothesis on why some of these things are true. With respect to the fixed-income markets, I have reached the conclusion—from these various observations of low rates and the flat yield curve—that the explanation probably relates to the fact that, at the global level, domestic absorption has fallen.  I’m not trying to sort out investment versus consumption.  Overall I think it has fallen below what it would have been otherwise.  This suggests to me a fall in the neutral rate, not a global slowdown—to cite the two choices that were in Vincent’s model.  I am heavily persuaded by the work that we saw on Monday, which Janet mentioned, about the number of real-side factors that may be holding back the economy and therefore reducing the neutral rate. I’d also say that the investment-GDP ratio, which has been quite low, has fed into fixed- income market performance because it has led to a change in the corporate financing gap.  Between 1991 and 2000, the financing gap rose from less than $35 billion to a peak of more than $300 billion. That rise reflected the very sharp increase in capital expenditures that we saw and have talked a great deal about in the telecom, high-tech, and transportation sectors, etc.  But the important thing is that the financing gap fell abruptly in 2001 and 2002, turned negative in 2003, and stayed June 29-30, 2005 143 of 234 accelerated tax depreciation, the financing gap returned to slightly positive territory in the first quarter.  But overall the negative financing gap, which has been widespread across industries, indicates to me that the business sector as a whole is generating enough cash to purchase capital expenditures without borrowing. It is also true that the dividend payout ratio has been relatively low.  The dividend payout ratio as a percentage of S&P operating earnings turns out to be, based on a report that I’ve just received, about 29 percent versus the 48 to 50 percent it has averaged over the last 40 years or so. So it’s clear that corporations are really sort of hoarding this cash. Since corporations do not tend to invest in equities, they do tend to invest in a number of fixed-income securities relatively short term.  I think that’s one of the things that have been driving these relatively low interest rates.  And just to put a final point on that, since the beginning of 2003, liquid assets in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose from about $310 billion, or more than 30 percent, to a total of $1.3 trillion.  While the rate of accumulation of liquid assets has slowed, I think the ratio is still a factor that has been driving this relatively low interest rate. In equity markets, my read of the data is that the low volatility is telling us a better story than the rise in the equity risk premium we’ve seen.  As Steve pointed out, or at least implied, the earnings-price ratio part of the equity risk premium really hasn’t changed very much over long periods of time. It is still in the 5½ to 6 percent range.  So it really is the fixed-income side that has been driving the slight widening of the equity risk premium. The final market signal that I think would be important to us is the read on interest rates. Some people have already talked about the interest rate signals we’ve seen.  I won’t belabor the issue. I will pick up a point that Janet made, which is that there are a number of different measures June 29-30, 2005 144 of 234 of the best forecasters of inflation.  It’s not the only reasonably good one.  From the Philadelphia Federal Reserve District, for example, the survey of professional economists also has a fairly good track record on forecasting inflation.  And as Janet pointed out, a random walk—or at least looking back to recent inflation history—has been a good forecaster.  The good news for us is that almost all of those forecasts fall in a range that’s very close to the Greenbook forecast, which gives us perhaps some comfort that the Greenbook has the forecast on inflation about right. The final point I’d make—if you remember, there were four reasons—is:  Would we be dissuaded from raising rates or would we change the signal if we thought it would create some financial instability?  In this regard, I asked the staff to do a very quick simulation of the effect of a rapid 1 percentage point rise in the fed funds rate over what is in the Greenbook forecast.  It turns out that if we were to be so rash as to dramatically raise rates by 1 percentage point over the baseline forecast, that would create by the end of 2006 a rise in the financial obligation ratio of only about 6 basis points.  I won’t go through all the math of it, but obviously it has a fair amount to do with the fact that a vast majority of the mortgages in this country are fixed-rate mortgages.  And second, by definition, if we were to raise rates so dramatically that it would result in a slowing in the economy, we would see individuals take on less debt.  But the bottom line is that I think the strategy we’ve outlined, if executed in a reasonable fashion, should not create financial instability. Let me conclude by saying that I think the strategy we have is about right.  I don’t believe there’s a reason to change market expectations quite dramatically.  I do think there’s some downward pressure on the neutral rate, and I think the Greenbook has picked that up.  So, by and large, I think the appropriate course is full steam ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. June 29-30, 2005 145 of 234"
"59";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  First, let me say that I’ll eschew any and all sports analogies in my presentation and give it to you more or less straight up. The oddity about our District is that we have almost no banks but we have enormous producers for the economy.  For example—and I’m prefacing my remarks this way for a purpose— together with the maquiladoras in Mexico we have two million manufacturing workers.  We have two of the largest airline companies.  We have some of the largest railroads.  We have Dell, Texas Instruments, EDS, and so on.  And I have assiduously been calling around and talking to the CEOs of those companies in order to get a feel not only about developments in our District but also in the national economy.  And this is my report to you. First of all, Mr. Chairman, our District lagged the nation in recovery and really didn’t come out of the recession until 2003.  We are now growing on pace with the national economy, at a rate of around 3½ percent plus.  That’s the good news. On the price front, obviously, there have been increases in the price of oil—and we do have some major oil companies and oil producers.  But other than in oil, oil field workers’ wages, prices of ranch land that may have mineral rights, and in health care, we see no evidence of the price pressures and pricing power that we’ve talked about before. I’ve taken some liberties, and with my colleague’s permission I’ve talked to a neighbor to the north who is an officer of the nation’s largest retailer—Wal-Mart.  The COO, whom I used to advise in my previous capacity, and I had a conversation two days ago and I was struck by his statement that “We’ve been surprised at the lack of inflation across the store.”  It’s a rather large store, I might add.  He indicated that the dynamics of the world economy are exerting downward price pressures, still to this day—deflating prices in electronics, clothing, and almost all retail June 29-30, 2005 126 of 234 my contact noted that they were having trouble making any price moves other than in a flat to down direction. This was confirmed by the CEO of Penney’s.  It’s a different price point.  They have about a 46 percent overlap with Wal-Mart.  But in household furnishings and apparel—again, there are concerns driven by Chinese production levels—they are trying to make up in volume for what they see as continued downward pressure on prices.  This is despite the existence of quotas in certain areas. And, in fact, my contact pointed out that they are forecasting that such pressure will continue for several years to come. In terms of residential construction, as I mentioned yesterday, I talked to someone at one of the nation’s largest homebuilders—a builder of 20,000 homes who has about $6 billion a year in revenue.  Interestingly, with construction costs—the cost of materials: plumbing, furnishings, and fixtures—there is continued price deflation.  Again, that is based on imports coming into the United States. The two areas where they do see constant prices—cement and lumber—Mr. Chairman, are largely due to trade restrictions; lumber sales from Canada and cement sales from Mexico are being restricted by trading arrangements. The largest paper product company, Kimberly-Clark, is in our District.  Interestingly, its CEO reported only one product line where they feel the ability to pass on costs based on energy prices, which again was the diaper market.  That has been the subject of quite a lot of discussion in our District!  [Laughter]  The story is different for prices of paper-based hospital products, which constitute a growing market because of linens being unsanitary.  They have a labor component; and because of the labor component from China, the Philippines, Estonia, and elsewhere, there is June 29-30, 2005 127 of 234 Our contacts in the chemical industry, which is substantial in our District, report that they cannot pass on price increases and have no pricing power.  In the IT [information technology] sector, our sources at Dell, TI, and EDS say that hardware and telecom costs continue downward. And India has begun to exert an effect that is keeping a price ceiling on software costs.  As for the shippers, I spoke with CEOs of three shippers—one again a former client in another District—and they report that they see growth “a tad bit slower.”  They are constrained by competition from DHL and the U.S. Postal Service and by their inability to pass on cost increases other than standard fuel surcharges. The CEO of the largest railroad in our area reports soft patches in the economy.  He noted particularly that growth in shipments for trans-Pacific trade has slowed to the high single digits from significant double digits.  Most notably, by the way, this is occurring in steel where prices have come off dramatically. Most interesting of all were the discussions we’ve had with shippers.  I previously served on a Norwegian shipping board—got off at just the right time—but have used those contacts to get a better understanding of the shipping industry.  And I think here are some interesting data:  Other than the category of LNG tankers, which was covered by the Financial Times adequately this morning, the Baltic Dry Index, for example, has been dropping dramatically.  In fact, the cost of shipping at one point, as you remember, exceeded the cost of goods shipped.  Last year, it cost $100,000 a day to charter a ship to carry iron ore for the manufacture of steel—as we saw in the charts—from either Brazil or India to China.  Now the cost is $31,000. But here is the clincher.  China has entered the shipbuilding business in a dramatic way.  It currently accounts for 14 percent of the shipbuilding market; 40 percent is produced by Korea and June 29-30, 2005 128 of 234 show that an additional 60 percent of the existing container fleet and 27 percent of the existing tanker fleet will come on stream in the next three to four years.  Needless to say, there is no pricing power in shipping. So in summary, Mr. Chairman, while the Eleventh District has caught up with the nation, soundings in our District and nationally indicate no pricing power.  And I detect a slight, but noticeable, shift among the people we speak with toward concerns about slower growth and away from concerns about inflation.  Thank you."
"60";"MR. GRAMLICH.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll let Tom respond on behalf of the Kansas City Royals.  [Laughter] This will be my 62nd and last statement at one of these meetings, and if you’ll bear with me I’d like to give a few parting thoughts before I ride off into the sunset. I believe most of us think about monetary policy in terms of what I will call a modified Taylor rule.  We don’t necessarily follow the explicit Taylor rule outcomes of the Bluebook but we look at inflation and unemployment and try to make them hit our target values, at least over some horizon.  From time to time, we may shade our judgments based on some other factor that may seem relevant, which is fine.  But the basic focus remains on inflation and unemployment.  I strongly agree with this basic focus, and I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble, for example.  There is no way to do that and still maximize the inflation/unemployment outcome. Monetary policy is broad and has broad effects.  When we take rates down in a soft economy, we probably will be creating some bubbles, or at least mini bubbles here and there—not because we want to, but because it is inevitable.  In the late ’90s, holding out against raising rates and hence letting the economy achieve very low unemployment rates probably did add to the June 29-30, 2005 156 of 234 add to the housing bubble, if, in fact, there is a housing bubble.  Given our primary focus on inflation and unemployment, I’m not sure there is anything we could have done about either bubble, and I am sure it would not have been wise to go out of our way to try to prick either bubble. Today’s policy challenge is to reverse the highly accommodative policy we followed a few years ago in response to what I still think was a real threat of deflation. There has been lots of speculation about the so-called neutral level of the federal funds rate, as if once we hit neutrality we can stop raising rates.  First off, this speculation is naive in the sense that whatever neutrality is, it is more likely a zone than a precise rate.  Moreover, neutrality would only be desirable if the rest of the economy were in balance, which is probably never strictly true, and certainly isn’t true now.  For these reasons, I’ve always been disdainful of the search for neutrality. Whatever neutrality is, I think in the current circumstance we ought to take rates somewhere north of it.  The reason is simple: lags.  We have taken the funds rate very low in response to threats of deflation.  That means that at the magic moment when we hit neutrality there will be still some accommodative policy in the pipeline—policy that would have to be offset with at least a slight overshooting on the other side.  This is a well-known shower problem that has enlivened countless macro classrooms.  One can also see this overshooting in the optimal policy simulations in the Bluebook. One issue that has always been important to me involves national saving.  I continue to be a national saving freak.  Our rate is too low; no two ways about it.  Continued low national saving implies either a drop in investment, which is undesirable, or continued international borrowing, which is unreliable.  Like others, I would greatly prefer to correct the problem through fiscal austerity. But despite some welcome bulges in federal revenue, we all know that this is not real June 29-30, 2005 157 of 234 Given that fiscal policy is not measuring up, can we do something about national saving with monetary policy?  Unfortunately, I think the answer is no, at least as long as we are operating under a modified Taylor rule.  Basically, our approach can determine the level of total output but not its composition between consumption and investment.  Regarding this composition, there is an interesting new development resulting from the financial innovation we talked about yesterday.  I admit to having always been skeptical of the empirical importance of interest rates on consumption. I would have thought that the form of housing wealth, whether cash or not, should not matter to rational consumers and that these consumers should realize that interest rates have ambiguous effects on their lifetime optimization decision.  However, if consumption in fact does depend strongly on interest rates, as our econometricians say, at least some of the crowding-out impact of higher interest rates will be felt by consumption.  So I will swallow my empirical misgivings and at least hope that our present easy fiscal and slightly harder monetary regime will be at least slightly less restrictive on investment and slightly more restrictive on consumption. Another issue is, of course, the housing bubble.  My own view is that there probably is now a slight macro housing bubble, with the problem obviously being worse in selected real estate markets.  As argued above, it would be a great mistake for the Fed to renounce its primary focus on inflation and unemployment and start fighting bubbles.  But might it be possible to shape policy in the direction of fighting bubbles?  The question sounds very reasonable.  The problem comes when one tries to get specific.  A few months ago there was a conference at Princeton to address this very question.  What should monetary policy do about bubbles?  I was enlisted as a speaker in this session, and I then characterized my views in Gilbert & Sullivan terms as, “Well, never.  Oh, hardly June 29-30, 2005 158 of 234 There are several arguments why we should hardly ever try to prick bubbles.  Asset bubbles may be too small to matter much in macro terms; they may be endogenous—the result of expansionary policy we have consciously followed; and pricking bubbles may run at cross-purposes with the monetary policy properly based on inflation and unemployment.  But I think the real problem with pricking bubbles can be seen from yesterday’s discussion.  How can we make that type of policy stabilizing?  If one reads the press or listens to Europeans—and I did that this weekend at Basel—the high level of house prices should lead us to raise interest rates higher than we otherwise would.  If one reads the Greenbook or the staff documents we talked about yesterday, the high level of house prices relative to rents leads to the expectation that house prices are more likely to decline than to rise, so that stabilizing policy would be to keep interest rates lower than we otherwise would. In that sense, the bubble policy conundrum is similar to the bond market conundrum.  Great analysis, guys, but do we move rates up or down?  In general, I think we aren’t going to know. House prices are high.  Do we respond to the expectation by lowering rates to fight the anticipated collapse? To put it mildly, this policy would be very hard to explain and carries the risk that our more accommodative policy would drive house prices even higher.  Imagine what Steve Roach and John Makin would say about that!  If I can coin a term, this would be viewed as a Greenspan “shotput.”  [Laughter] On the other hand, do we do what the press would have us do—raise rates and likely destabilize? This is a tough, perhaps impossible, question.  And our best approach is most likely to June 29-30, 2005 159 of 234 Whatever the case, I’m happy to raise the funds rate another notch today and to continue with the “measured pace” rhetoric. For the future, my own five dollars says that you will never figure out what neutrality is, but I am confident that you will be able to tell when to stop raising rates. This leads me to my final point, which is to say how much I’ve enjoyed working with all of you. These meetings have been interesting, challenging, and productive.  I can’t say that monetary policy is the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life, because I did spend three years trying to get diverse people to agree about Social Security, but it was hard.  And I think we did well.  The staff has been superb.  I can’t imagine better preparation for meetings like this than from reading the Greenbook and the Bluebook.  All of you have been consistently interesting and sensible.  And the Chairman has run great meetings and has admirably melded our diverse views into a coherent and effective monetary policy.  I will be eternally grateful for having been a part of it.  [Applause] Thank you."
"61";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Anecdotal reports from our regional contacts and the most recent data releases suggest that business conditions in the Southeast have remained positive since our last meeting.  Florida, as has been the case for some time, has been dominant in terms of both employment growth and the pace of economic activity, given the strength in sectors such as tourism and housing. Coincident indicators, like personal income and state tax revenues, suggest that our District’s growth over the past several months has averaged about 3 percent, with major contributions coming not only from Florida but also from Alabama and, to a lesser extent, Georgia and Mississippi. District employment growth has been averaging roughly 35,000 per month until the disappointing report of only 3,000 new jobs in May.  Our regional unemployment rate has been running about 0.2 percentage point below the national average.  However, absent Florida, the rest of June 29-30, 2005 116 of 234 The apparent slowing in employment growth was a concern in terms of the regional outlook, although I would say that recent anecdotal reports on hiring are more encouraging than the official data.  It seems to me that the key question from a policy perspective is whether there are signs of regional imbalances on either the price or the real side that might shed light on the national picture and on the broader risk to either growth or inflation. With respect to growth, the capital spending survey suggests that planned investment spending in our District remains solid.  And the motivations for this are now more rooted in the expectation of increased sales rather than the need to cut costs, improve productivity, or to replace obsolete technology.  Having said that, let me note that we received some interesting and sobering anecdotal comments from our directors.  One director from the paper pulp and forest industry expressed concerns, perhaps selfish concerns, about the overexpansion for certain manufactured building supplies.  He indicated, for example, that production capacity for building products such as gypsum wall board, concrete, and manufactured lumber was on a pace to expand 30 to 35 percent worldwide over the next three years.  In the specific case of one product that is dear to his heart, oriented strand board, he said that the increase looks more like 40 percent. He characterized the industry’s very aggressive investment spending plans as preparing to, and I quote, “jump off the cliff yet again.” [Laughter] Our reports indicate that investment spending has also increased in the air cargo freight area, driven by international demand.  Our bankers tell us that commercial and industrial lending remains highly competitive, with a resulting narrowing of spreads, although credit quality continues to be good. Our director from the forest product sector noted a continued softening in paper box demand, June 29-30, 2005 117 of 234 Finally, there is the housing situation, which we talked about for a long time yesterday afternoon.  As I’ve been reporting for several meetings, some of our markets, especially those in coastal areas of South Florida and the Florida panhandle, are experiencing a level of building activity and price increases that are clearly, in my view, unsustainable.  Nearly every major Florida city now has experienced increases in the double-digit range, and some, like Miami, Palm Beach, Sarasota, and West Palm, have been reporting increases in housing prices on a year-over-year basis of between 25 and 30 percent.  While our discussion yesterday did not seem to indicate a consensus on a national housing bubble, based on past experience I’m reasonably comfortable characterizing the housing feeding frenzy in some of our markets as being a bubble or a near bubble. For example, the number of major projects planned or under construction in Miami now totals 114, most of which are high-rise developments.  That includes 61,000 condo units—eight times the number that were built in the last decade—and a total of 100,000 new parking spaces.  I know we don’t have any process for introducing exhibits into the record, but I’d like to pass Dave Stockton this pictorial of the new projects in Miami, so that he can continue to worry a little bit along with me. [Laughter] My supervision and regulation staff thinks this is an accident waiting to happen in our area. And while the local market excesses probably do not represent systemic national risk, the shakeouts could have serious regional consequences.  My bank supervision staff points out that housing- related credit risks to our bank lenders are not so much from defaults on permanent mortgage financing that we talked about yesterday, but rather from lending for land acquisition, development, and construction. The ugly picture we have seen before—and that they think we may very likely see again June 29-30, 2005 118 of 234 developers to go ahead and complete the construction of additional units to make them saleable, further depressing the market; and speculators who had hoped to see big capital gains walking away or defaulting on their contracts, giving their properties back to the lender.  Perhaps it’s because of where I sit, but I am less comforted than some of my colleagues about the housing situation. As for the national economy, my view is that real GDP growth is most likely to remain on its recent path, averaging around 3½ percent, which we judge to be very close to trend.  Consumer spending seems to continue to be roughly in line with GDP growth, confidence has rebounded, investment spending is still supportive, and manufacturing has seemed a bit brighter in recent data reports.  I would characterize employment growth as better than the “improving gradually” language would suggest, and I think it should be sufficient to at least keep the unemployment rate around current levels or perhaps nudge it even lower. I am less sure about the prospects for underlying inflation.  But given the amount of policy accommodation that remains in place, and that will remain in place even if we raise our target rate another 25 basis points today, I believe the inflation risks are now on the upside.  While the most recent monthly inflation numbers dipped a bit, the overall path for the last year has clearly been up. And the Greenbook forecast and other forecasts of inflation have been raised for the remainder of this year and into next year.  Until further evidence is available, there is the risk of putting too much weight on the high-frequency numbers, such as the May PPI and CPI releases, and losing sight of the longer-run inflation path. Even more important than this, however, is the presence of the longer-term imbalances that we’ve talked about, which increase the risk to the economy.  Most of these are largely beyond our June 29-30, 2005 119 of 234 troubles in our domestic auto industry and, of course, problems in the airline industry.  Both of these latter problem areas may have undesirable spillover effects to financial markets. It also looks as if higher energy prices are here for a while, and this is reflected in futures prices. Higher energy costs will clearly squeeze energy-dependent businesses first, but I think we’ll also have uncertain trickle-down effects that can’t be good for other industries. I’ve already expressed my concerns about the unstable path of housing in at least some important local markets.  I believe that the least risky policy strategy through these unusual times is to set monetary policy so that it does not contribute to unsustainable activities.  Therefore, I believe that continuing on our recent policy path for the next few meetings would be the best course of action. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"62";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, our view regarding the national economy is basically similar to others I have heard here.  We agree with the consensus of GDP growth running about 3½ percent, slightly over our potential rate.  And we see that going forward through the rest of this year and into next year. I also would say that the anecdotal evidence coming from our region is very consistent with this above-trend growth rate.  Consumer spending continues to grow solidly, with retailers reporting June 29-30, 2005 120 of 234 quarters.  Tourism continues to expand briskly, boosting occupancy rates at hotels and resorts in our region. And energy activity remains high. One of the interesting anecdotes arose during a recent visit I made to the Cessna plant in Wichita, which is booming right now.  They have back orders for their jets—general aviation aircraft—running well into 2007, with prices running from a mere $2½ million to a little better than $20 million for their Citation 10, which flies at 0.8 mach.  And the demand is incredible.  So the general economic environment reflected in these parts of our region really is consistent with a strong growth rate going forward. On the national inflation outlook, I understand the arguments given today for why inflation should continue to ease off.  For that to occur, it is critical in my view that we continue to move policy out of its current accommodative stance.  If we don’t, I think we are stimulating demand—I think it’s reflected in some of the other comments here and in some of the anecdotes that I’ve pointed out—and I think we will have future upward adjustments in inflation as we move forward. So I think it is critical that we get ourselves closer to that neutral zone that we talk about, which no one can pinpoint with certainty but which is probably somewhere between 3½ and 4½ percent.  I’ll leave it at that."
"63";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I made only small revisions to my forecast from last January.  We’ve seen some notable fluctuations in data and sentiment over the last five months, but basically I think we’ve ended up pretty close to where we started, with prospects for growth that are close to the growth rate of potential, perhaps a bit above, and core PCE inflation stable at a little over its rate of last year. The data we received over the intermeeting period reinforced this favorable outlook, assuaging some of the concerns on both the demand and inflation fronts that I had at our meeting in early May.  Growth in private final purchases has been good, with the second-quarter forecast to be around 4 percent.  Slack in labor markets has continued to erode gradually.  Core CPI inflation slowed, supporting the notion that some of the earlier pickup was a product of the pass-through of previous increases in energy and other import prices, and core PCE inflation has been stable. Commodity and intermediate goods price pressures have abated, consistent with the moderate pace of increase in production and a judgment that the global economy was not facing significant bottlenecks, except possibly in energy markets.  And importantly, inflation expectations fell on balance despite the further increase in oil prices.  The recent further rise in oil prices will indeed put some upward pressure on core inflation, but that should be limited in time, and increases in the prices of other imports should abate considerably, owing to the strength of the dollar. Moreover, the behavior of most measures of labor compensation suggests to me that labor markets are not in the process of overheating and may even have some degree of slack remaining. And declines in inflation expectations provide some assurance that past increases in energy and June 29-30, 2005 146 of 234 Over time, of course, it is appropriate monetary policy that will keep the balance between demand and potential supply and inflation in check, and I actually found that thinking about the appropriate path for policy was harder than thinking about the outlook. In a fundamental sense, the favorable outlook rests on a judgment that over the last year or so monetary policy has been well calibrated to the evolving situation.  Market participants seem comfortable with policy to date and with their expectations for the future.  The simultaneous decline in expected funds rates and inflation expectations over the intermeeting period indicates confidence that inflation will be contained.  And the rise in equity prices and still fairly narrow risk premiums in credit markets must rest on expectations of continued solid growth. I think we can be fairly confident that appropriate policy is likely to require additional tightening even beyond this meeting.  That’s what is built into the yield curve, and that structure of rates seems to be consistent with growth continuing around or perhaps a little above the rate of potential and with the output gap about disappearing.  And with output probably close to its sustainable potential and inflation already having picked up a little, I agree with the rest of you that we’re at a point in the cycle at which we need to be especially careful about keeping inflation pressures contained. But how much further we need to tighten in order to accomplish that, and at what pace, are the interesting questions. The staff and markets have built in a leveling out of the funds rate at about 3¾ to 4 percent. That’s quite low by historical standards.  The Greenbook has an implied short-run r* of only 1½ percent. Still, that’s not implausible, judging from the experience of the last few years when very accommodative policy has been associated with growth only moderately in excess of potential. And the recent downward revisions to market expectations for growth abroad—and expected policy June 29-30, 2005 147 of 234 demand.  Nonetheless, the underlying truth is that we really don’t know how much we need to tighten, and, fortunately, we don’t need to figure that out today. I recognize that the 25-basis-points-per-meeting path is not an optimum policy.  As we can see from the Bluebook simulations, an optimum policy would tend to flatten out the trajectory as we get close to what we think is a stopping point.  The risk is that the 25-basis-points-per-meeting pace will tend to ratify your prediction, Mr. Chairman, that our last tightening will be one too many. Given the lags in the effects of policy, if we wait to see confirming signs that past increases have slowed growth on a sustainable basis—and we aren’t seeing just another soft patch—we probably will indeed have overshot the mark.  The path could be especially problematic if it extends into the fall when our meetings get closer together.  Surely, the pace of tightening shouldn’t be dictated by the meeting schedule rather than economic needs.  But I do take some comfort in the expectation that policy doesn’t have to be that precise.  The market will tend to compensate for any overshooting by building in a reversal, provided we let it know that we are open to that possibility when the time comes. For now, sticking to our path of gradual rate increases would seem to be the most prudent course, but such a path is conditional on the economy following its expected path.  We should be willing to deviate either way, even as early as August, should the data indicate a very substantial deviation in the path of spending or prices.  And our statement today should not be read as implying anything about our expectations beyond August.  That will depend on data.  The higher we go with rates, the more we need to keep an open mind about stopping places and possibly even the pace of tightening. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. June 29-30, 2005 148 of 234"
"64";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Fifth District advanced moderately in May and June.  The survey results we released earlier this week showed that manufacturing shipments edged higher and that revenues of service firms grew somewhat more quickly this month.  New orders in manufacturing seemed to slip this month, however.  Growth in retail sales moderated in June, as our big ticket sales index contracted slightly after having moved sharply higher in May.  District housing markets remained fairly hot—maybe not as hot as Miami, but fairly hot.  Home sales continued at high levels.  Bids above asking prices were common in popular locations.  Markets for beach properties and for condos in downtown areas are especially June 29-30, 2005 136 of 234 growth to pick up over the next six months.  Our contacts also expect an upturn in capital spending growth over that period, and price pressures in the District remain contained. Indications are that the national economy continues to perform well, although concerns about the housing market and energy prices are causing jitters in some quarters about the sustainability of the expansion.  Average net job growth for the three months ending in May exceeded 150,000 per month—a rate sufficient to keep up the steady improvement in labor markets we’ve seen since last year.  And the Greenbook expects real GDP to average above 3½ percent through the end of 2006, slightly faster than potential. To me, the most striking revision in the June Greenbook was the 0.2 increase in the projected path for core PCE inflation through 2006.  Expected inflation is now 2.1 percent for ’05 and 1.9 percent for ’06. I found this revision striking, because 2 percent is the upper limit of my own comfort zone for core PCE inflation.  Moreover, market participants are aware that the core PCE index is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure.  And if we allow it to drift much above 2 percent, we run the risk of unhinging longer-run inflation expectations, especially if energy prices spike up further as well. Having said that, I take heart from the fact that inflation expectations have fallen somewhat in the past couple of months.  TIPS inflation compensation, both near-term and longer-run, has continued to decline even in the face of climbing oil prices.  Of course, inflation expectations build in beliefs about our future behavior.  I read declining inflation compensation, along with the apparent fall in inflation uncertainty for which Vincent’s staff apparently finds evidence, as implying that markets expect us to do whatever is necessary to hold the line on inflation. I see three main risks to the outlook.  First, with oil markets as tight as they are, the world June 29-30, 2005 137 of 234 Second, we’ve been anticipating a handoff from housing investment to business investment over the course of this recovery.  While business investment has continued to pick up, the demand for new capital appears to be limited now by the rate at which firms expect their output to grow.  So the potential problem is that businesses may be reluctant to pick up more slack before they see that housing is headed for a soft landing.  Yet that reluctance would interfere with or impede a smooth handoff, making it more difficult to achieve. Third, I find myself worrying about the possibility of an inflation scare in the bond market, despite the recent decline in TIPS spreads.  It’s not clear how likely this is, but if it happened, it would be very costly.  A spike in long-term yields could be particularly harmful today for elevated housing prices.  It would raise long-term mortgage rates directly, obviously.  Moreover, it would force us to raise short-term real rates.  And in such circumstances I think it would be even harder for us to facilitate this handoff of investment from the housing sector to the business sector without an intervening recession.  Thank you."
"65";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In recent weeks we’ve heard a wide variety of views about business conditions in the Seventh District.  Most sectors have good news as well as some bad news but, overall, conditions are positive and seem consistent with an economy growing near trend. Evidently, accommodative policy is offsetting the drags from energy and the international sector. Within manufacturing, heavy equipment producers continue to report strong sales growth. For example, all 21 of Caterpillar’s business units are above plan.  This year some of their product lines have sold out for 2006, and they have begun taking orders for 2007.  In contrast, one of our directors who is the CEO of a large diversified manufacturing company reports a surprisingly sharp slowdown in orders, although he concedes that business had been growing at an unsustainably high rate. The Chicago Purchasing Managers’ Index, which will be released today, edged down from 54.1 in May to 53.6 in June. In retail, apparel sales are generally strong and mall traffic seems good, but a retailer in home furnishings reported a marked slowdown in sales during the past six to eight weeks.  In motor vehicles, GM noted strong sales in response to its new marketing program.  GM and Ford both continue to forecast light vehicle sales of about 16.8 million units in 2005—the consensus forecast from our recent auto outlook symposium had similar numbers for 2005—and they expect sales to remain near this pace in 2006. Labor markets continue to improve.  Temporary-help firms report that growth is moderate, not spectacular. They say demand is soft for low-skilled workers, but it is stronger for professional, technical, and clerical workers.  And average temp wage and benefit increases have held steady in June 29-30, 2005 110 of 234 The news on the price front is similar to what we’ve seen in the last few meetings, with increases for plastics, rubber, and heavy machinery—and, of course, energy.  Integrated steel producers are burdened by high coke and iron ore prices.  In contrast, steel scrap prices have fallen 35 percent from their peak in November of last year, which reduced the costs for the mini mills. Turning to the national outlook, since our last meeting we’ve learned that the soft patch was temporary, as many of us expected.  Furthermore, the core inflation numbers improved but energy prices moved up even further, as we’ve just been discussing. Looking forward, our outlook is very similar to the forecast in the Greenbook, with growth slowing in the current quarter but picking up somewhat in the second half of the year.  On balance, we project that GDP will increase at a rate near 3½ percent both this year and next.  The story underlying this forecast is a familiar one.  Accommodative monetary policy and the trend in underlying productivity appear sufficient to offset the current drag from higher energy prices. On the inflation front, we don’t see broad-based resource constraints pushing up prices.  The pass-through of cost pressures to consumer prices has been modest.  In fact, Mr. Chairman, after you left our board meeting two weeks ago, my directors gave me a hard time regarding the suggestion that businesses had any pricing power at all.  In addition, inflation expectations remain contained, even with the most recent increase in energy prices.  So we see core PCE price inflation peaking at 2 percent this year and edging off a touch next year. Of course, we should not be too sanguine.  It would be unfortunate if underlying core inflation drifted above 2 percent, and there is some risk of that happening.  Resource slack has narrowed, as Dave Wilcox pointed out earlier.  And given our uncertainty as to the true level of potential output, we may already have closed most meaningful resource gaps.  With oil prices June 29-30, 2005 111 of 234 could happen if we are perceived to be improperly monetizing the higher oil prices.  Therefore, it will be important for us to continue to remove policy accommodation in order to contain inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations. So at this meeting, we should increase rates by 25 basis points.  For the remainder of 2005, we may need to increase rates more than currently expected by the futures markets.  I agree with the view expressed by some people during the chart show: Risk management suggests that a path with higher interest rates would be a better course for our policy than the one outlined in the futures market.  And given the risks to the inflation outlook, a flat federal funds rate of 3¾ percent throughout 2006, as the markets expect, is simply too low."
"66";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As Susan indicated, I, too, looked at the mortgage market in anticipation of the theme of our discussions yesterday.  But I also had a concern about the extent to which the mortgage market might be creating froth in the market.  I interviewed several of the largest mortgage originators.  I talked to contacts at banks, nonbanks, and one of the large subprime lenders and asked them to approach the question from the same perspective.  That is, I asked them: What are you finding that is new or different in your market?  What attracts your eye because it’s new, and where do you see the risks embedded in the nature of the mortgage market today?  This does not address the question that President Guynn raised about the risks associated with the activities of contractors or real estate developers, which is a separate and very significant risk. It may get at the question that President Yellen asked as to where the ultimate source of the stupidity is in the market—not whether or not there is stupidity in the market. In conclusion, mortgage terms are indeed becoming more flexible and less restrictive, creating certain defined risk exposures.  While each of the risk exposures appears to be both June 29-30, 2005 152 of 234 due to the layering of the exposures.  It’s the layering that really causes the risk.  And, in part, it means that the most significant body of the risk exposures is in identifiable markets and lenders. There is a lack of consensus as to how the relaxation of credit standards will impact safety and soundness. To date, loan delinquencies have remained modest, both within and outside of the banking industry. However, the undiminished appetite, particularly for the nonconforming mortgage product, has allowed for the flexibility to continue.  And there is no slowing in sight, despite all the warnings that we have heard and indications in some markets that there has been a leveling, and even a decline, in some property values. While that environment is clearly likely to produce unrecognized risk somewhere in the financial system, it seems unlikely that that risk will be in any of the portfolio lenders, including the bank lenders, to any significant extent, because of the avaricious nature of the MBS [mortgage­ backed securities] market.  The risks, as Susan and others have mentioned, are pretty obvious.  The IO loans, now for terms of up to 10 years, may account for 50 percent of total loans in some markets.  So there’s a greater risk of negative amortizations.  Also becoming more popular is what is known as the alt-A mortgage product, which makes loans based on stated incomes and stated assets, and carries a higher interest rate in exchange for fewer verifications of the income and asset figures provided by the borrower. Let me give you an example of how the layering that causes the risk can work.  Let’s take as an example a loan in a high-end market such as California.  The mortgage sought by the borrower would exceed the maximum of Fannie or Freddie, automatically making it a nonconforming loan and automatically removing the risk parameters that are embedded in the conforming product. Because it is nonconforming, it opens the opportunity for the Alt-A product, which means that it June 29-30, 2005 153 of 234 associated with that instrument does not seem to be captured in what the secondary market is looking for. So the secondary market will buy it.  The originator of the loan is able to meet the competition and rid itself of that risk. That said, there are some identifiable risks that are clearly being managed.  According to some lenders, about 20 to 25 markets bear careful watching, and lenders have started to exercise restraint in those markets.  Most of the markets were mentioned yesterday, but obviously they include places like Florida and Las Vegas. There is also an ability to look at investor properties and subdivide that category into three groups.  One of them is the typical purchaser of a vacation home; Jack Guynn is buying in the Blue Ridge Mountains, for example.  Or, as Susan mentioned, another good example is the investor who is concerned about the equity markets and wants to move into residential real estate.  So that isolates those in the third group—the most high-risk borrowers.  They are the ones who want to get by with the greatest amount of leverage.  That is the borrower who is simply looking to take immediate short-term advantage of any increase in value.  And that is a buyer those careful mortgage lenders can address with more specificity. A great deal of uncertainty, frankly, surrounds the interest rate risk exposure, because there have been very few adverse interest rate periods in recent years and the industry experience is limited.  But the availability and proliferation of FICO scores means that interest-only and high loan-to-value mortgages are given only to those within certain FICO bands, where the lender has the greatest confidence in the borrower’s repayment capability, which is based on the historical experience of that borrower in terms of his or her debt repayment record. To date, foreclosures have been limited and minimal at banks and bank mortgage June 29-30, 2005 154 of 234 secondary market.  One lender told me that they are using the secondary market first of all for their conforming products; second, for their nonconforming products; third, for their HELOCs; and fourth, for loans on first delinquency.  And for the latter, this lender is selling them at only a 2 or 3 percent reduction to book. So that loan is going off the books, and in some instances, they are even selling the residual in the secondary market.  So there are five different channels through which this lender is able to use the secondary market.  It sounded to me very similar to what the 1960s New York Yankees were doing with the old Kansas City A’s under Charlie O. Finley—using them to improve asset quality.  [Laughter]  They were unloading high-risk properties, and doing so without any expectation of compensation from the counterparty.  And they were doing it annually.  So it’s much the same thing that is happening now. As for the secondary market, why is that market so avaricious?  I’d cite a number of reasons. There are many new investors, including the hedge funds, with minimal experience in dealing with market uncertainties.  There are many new products; 50 percent of the mortgage-backed products are either alt-A or nonprime.  That’s the flow, as we discussed yesterday.  There is evidence of a lack of secondary market discretion, including the ability to price for risk; the risk premium simply does not reflect the risk embedded in that product.  There have been some indications that the secondary market is starting to tighten its standards, one of which Susan mentioned, which is the new guidelines from Standard and Poor’s.  The other is the beginning of some change, particularly in the AAA tranche, where a slight price increase recently was passed on. In summary, the activity in the mortgage market shows no signs of abating.  The risk exposures remain, and the risk exposures seem most likely to be in the MBS market.  The place to look for the first evidence of weakness would be in the first-loss position, wherever that first-loss June 29-30, 2005 155 of 234 and disseminator of risk or if those in that market will be the last to recognize the risk that’s embedded in what they’re doing and know how to price it. Mr. Chairman, I did not address the statement today because I see no need to adjust our “measured pace” language or to make any other significant adjustment to our statement at this meeting.  Thank you."
"67";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to start by saying that I thought the staff presentation was very comprehensive and very sound, including the discussion of risks and standard errors. So I congratulate the staff on a very fine job there. Let me just summarize very quickly key anecdotal information that I have gathered.  First of all, my sense from my contacts is that the real economy is growing moderately, continuing the growth of about the past year or so.  Second, labor supply of hourly workers is plentiful.  There are lots of anecdotes of that type, but a dramatic example is a new Wal-Mart store opening in San Diego, where there were 10,000 applicants for 400 jobs.  That’s a very typical story; the margin may not always be that big, but it’s a very typical story.  I get the same kind of information from my contacts in the transportation industry.  The only exception there seems to be truck drivers, a position for which qualified applicants seem to be in chronic short supply. Third, managerial and technical skills are becoming in somewhat short supply.  A contact with a major software company told me that their outsourcing to India was actually more a matter of June 29-30, 2005 135 of 234 than the cost. This is, I’m sure, for standard sorts of software code writing.  Another item in that vein is that later this year we could see a strike of UPS and FedEx pilots.  There are ongoing negotiations.  The contract expired some time ago, or at least became available for a reopening some time ago.  And the pilots apparently are quite far apart from the companies in those negotiations. Fourth, I don’t think there’s any doubt that energy prices are having a significant effect on the purchasing power of, let’s say, the lower half of the income distribution.  Wal-Mart has been talking about that for some time in terms of their same-store sales.  But another very interesting Wal-Mart anecdote was that they’ve observed among their own employees a reduction in health care utilization—that is, fewer doctors’ visits—but an increase in emergency room visits. Apparently employees are struggling some to make the co-payments and that kind of thing, again emphasizing the stress that exists in many lower-income households.  That’s where I’ll stop.  Thank you."
"68";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Third District softened somewhat in late spring, but this appears to be temporary and our business contacts continue to expect gains in line with recent trends.  Retail sales fell in May.  For many area retailers, this was attributed to cold and rainy weather in the early spring, and early reports in June suggest that sales have picked up with the return of warm weather.  The outlook for auto sales, however, remains subdued.  Earlier in the year, dealers had been optimistic that auto sales would improve. Now they expect fewer sales this year than last. Manufacturing activity in the District also weakened in June.  After showing a sizable rebound in April, the index of general activity weakened in May and turned negative—with a reading of minus 2.2—in June, which is consistent with flat manufacturing activity.  The indexes on new orders and shipments remained in positive territory, and our respondents did not expect this lull June 29-30, 2005 112 of 234 As part of the Board staff’s survey, we polled the District’s business contacts, including those in manufacturing, retailing, and services, on their plans for capital spending over the next 6 to 12 months.  About half of our firms reported that they planned to maintain capital spending at current levels.  Plans for increased spending were more prevalent among nonmanufacturers than manufacturers, while planned reductions were scattered across both types of firms. Activity in other sectors of the region continued to expand in the intermeeting period.  The downward trend in nonresidential construction appears to have bottomed out, and commercial real estate leasing activity has been rising.  There have been six consecutive quarters of positive absorption.  The pace of home sales has risen since the winter and was about steady during May, at a very strong pace.  House-price appreciation continues to be strong. Regional employment continues to grow, although not as strongly as in the first quarter. Employment rose in each of our three states for the first two months of the second quarter.  The three-state unemployment rate declined from 4.8 percent in the first quarter to 4.5 percent in April and May. Business contacts continue to report that it is difficult to find employees to fill openings. One of our contacts says the labor shortage in southern New Jersey has reached crisis proportions. One pharmaceutical firm in the District is bringing in workers from its plant in Seattle, while a large energy company in our District is trying to attract skilled labor from as far away as Alabama.  Other companies report that it’s taking much longer to hire people than was true a year ago. Price pressures in the District continue to build but at a slower pace than earlier this year. The current and future price indexes in our manufacturing survey moderated in June, but remained at relatively high levels.  A special manufacturing survey question in May revealed that nearly half of our participants had raised prices of their product lines since the beginning of the year, and about June 29-30, 2005 113 of 234 of the goods they are purchasing have been roughly steady, fuel surcharges are common on goods shipped to them. In summary, economic conditions in the Third District softened a bit in the late spring, but indications suggest that this is temporary.  Regional business contacts remain upbeat and generally expect an improvement in the region’s economy in the months ahead. My assessment of the economic conditions in the nation is similar to what it was last month. The expansion continues with the fits and starts one expects to see as the economy approaches a sustainable growth rate and full employment.  The revised data suggest that there was not much, if any, soft spot in the first quarter.  While some of the recent monthly data have been on the soft side—for example, May employment growth and retail sales—these follow months where the data were on the high side.  Payroll employment has averaged 180,000 per month this year, consistent with our forecast.  Although the second quarter is likely to be softer than the first quarter, averaging through the monthly volatility shows an economy that is growing near its potential and is close to full employment. Higher oil prices will likely have some dampening effect on economic activity and put some upward pressure on inflation, but the effects need not be strong enough to divert the expansion.  The economy has proved quite resilient as the price of oil increased from $30 a barrel at the beginning of 2003 to over $60 a barrel more recently. I’d like to compliment the Board and Reserve Bank staff on the housing price discussion.  I found myself somewhat comforted by the analysis showing rather benign effects, at least at a macroeconomic level, from the potential drop in real estate values.  And I also wanted to June 29-30, 2005 114 of 234 review the various potential explanations for the decline in long rates as short rates have risen and to think about their different implications for monetary policy. That said, I find the arguments that lower long rates might be signaling a persistent economic slowdown unconvincing.  None of the forecasters we poll is predicting such a scenario. For example, our most recent survey of professional forecasters suggests sustained output growth over its forecast period.  I find the explanation that focuses on an increase in demand for long-term debt relative to supply more interesting.  But as the staff points out, the reason for the outsized demand would be relevant, as would information concerning its expected persistence.  The implication for monetary policy would presumably depend on the source of the demand and its perceived persistence. Putting the pieces together, our forecast is similar to that in the Greenbook.  We both see the economy expanding at near potential and closing in on full employment.  The major difference is that the Greenbook projects a decline in core inflation between this year and next, while we are projecting a rise in core inflation; hence, my question earlier.  We think there is less slack in the labor market, so we expect growth in hourly compensation to run above productivity gains and to accelerate modestly in 2006, leading to a modest rise in unit labor costs.  This rise in unit labor costs translates into a slowly increasing core inflation rate.  We also anticipate some depreciation of the dollar, which will cause a modest rise in import prices, and we anticipate some pass-through from the energy price increases into core inflation.  I believe inflation will remain well contained over the period, provided we remain focused on our goal of price stability. Consistent with all of that, our forecast incorporates a steeper path for the fed funds rate than does the Greenbook.  Given my assessment of economic conditions and the forecast, I believe it’s June 29-30, 2005 115 of 234 last meeting, it seems likely that we will continue to raise rates until we actually come to what we perceive to be the end.  Given the underlying strength of the economy, the potential for increased inflation, and the fact that policy remains accommodative, I do not think we’re at the end of the tightening cycle. Regarding the language, I’ll leave the specifics to the policy discussion.  But our discussions last month persuaded me that we have sufficient flexibility with the current language and that the time to make significant changes may be when we pause and feel uncertain about the future direction of policy or when we think a significant change in policy is required.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"69";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Anecdotes from our directors and others, incoming data on the regional and national economies, and the results from running our forecasting models all appear to me to be consistent with real GDP growth of 3 percent or more.  Personally, like many others, I expect growth of around 3½ percent—the kind of expansion we have been experiencing. I’ve been struck most recently, as I reviewed the latest anecdotes and the incoming evidence on the economy, by the breadth of the positive reports, though of course much of what we have been seeing is a continuation of what has been going on for some time.  So I’ll just cover the positive things very, very quickly: sustained strength in home prices, sales, and residential construction activity; incipient improvement in nonresidential construction activity; expansion in manufacturing in the aggregate; moderate gains in employment; continuing increases in consumer spending; and a positive situation with regard to capital spending. As Sandy Pianalto just noted, there are parts of our economy—what I guess I would call “old industrial America”—such as domestically owned automobile producers and their suppliers, and though not industrial, the hub-and-spoke airlines, where there are lots of problems.  But it seems to me that the forecasts adequately allow for those circumstances already.  So, to me, the economy and the economic expansion appear to be on solid footing. As to inflation, I have not changed my forecast, but I must admit I am a little less comfortable about the situation than I was formerly.  That’s partly because we’ve gotten a little more inflation this year and last year than I had earlier anticipated.  But also, as I listened to Dave Wilcox’s attribution analysis, I got a little nervous.  I’ve had a lot of experience doing those kinds of June 29-30, 2005 131 of 234 the underlying dynamics or interactions of the price performance.  So I’m a little more concerned than I was formerly that inflation, if not tilted to the upside, is at least getting locked in at a somewhat higher rate. Having said all of that, it seems to me that as far as policy is concerned we have been on the appropriate course and we should continue on that course.  I think the policy implications are really rather straightforward."
"70";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d focus my remarks today on the topic we discussed yesterday—the housing markets.  And then I’d like to talk a little bit about some of the liquidity issues in housing markets and relate that to monetary policy. Let me start by saying that overall I agree that there is not a major risk of significant problems in the housing markets.  But there is momentum building in the housing area that is raising some issues about which I am not as sanguine as many of the staff who gave the presentations yesterday.  But I want to compliment the staff from both the Board and the Reserve Banks.  I thought they did a fantastic job in pulling all of the information together While inflation overall is apparently well contained, I, too, am generally concerned about the continued ratcheting up of our expectations.  The one thing that stands out is how much housing prices have jumped relative to overall price levels.  We know that the average price for new homes in May was up 8 percent from a year ago.  Existing home prices were up 10.2 percent, as was said yesterday.  But inventories remain relatively lean, even though the supply has risen by about half a month since the beginning of the year. When I look at the jump in housing prices, I’m trying to see if consumers are saying, “We have good, strong income growth and we’re able to afford more.”  Or are they seeing these price increases and trying to jump in while they still can afford a house, before home prices get totally out of their range?  Are they viewing real estate as an alternative for investment purposes, after being stung in the stock market drop of a few years ago?  Really, all of these factors may be at the heart of the strong demand for housing. But I also think that the financing markets are sending different signals in these areas.  I know Mark is going to talk about some of the specifics but I want to discuss some of the macro June 29-30, 2005 149 of 234 customers going to banks to refinance and take advantage of low, long-term fixed interest rates.  So most of the mortgage originations in the 2001-2002 period were predominantly fixed-rate loans or they were ARMs that had fairly long fixed-rate periods before becoming adjustable.  What is striking is how this has been changing in the last 12 months.  ARMs of all types have jumped from about 16 percent of originations in 2001 to about one-fourth in 2002 and 2003, to over half of mortgage originations last year.  This is happening in a period when short rates are rising and long rates are flat to down.  If bankers are really working to the benefit of their customers, why aren’t they locking in long rates in this environment? It is also the case, when we look at the mix of products, that more of the mortgages are subprime products.  Subprime originations have climbed to over 18 percent of total originations.  In terms of where these mortgages are being parked—whether they are on the books of banks and other financial institutions or are being securitized—about two-thirds of originations continue to be securitized. So the use of the markets is about the same.  But the types of mortgages being securitized are changing. Again, these are predominantly ARMs, and more of them tend to be option ARMs—the higher-risk kinds of structures. As we saw in the information presented about the real estate mortgage pools that are being created, the risk profile in those pools is changing.  Interest-only mortgages were basically nonexistent in those pools two years ago; they are now running over 3.6 percent of them.  Whereas a lot of these IO mortgages had very conservative loan-to-value ratios—under 80 percent—more and more of them now have loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80 percent.  And about 9 percent of the IOs in these pools are going to subprime borrowers—that is, the riskiest customers.  Yet those loans require interest-only payments, no amortization.  Two weeks ago S&P required additional June 29-30, 2005 150 of 234 HELOCs are being used more for purchase money down payments.  People no longer have to save to make a down payment.  And when we look at HELOCs in general, for the last three years they’ve grown at a compound rate of over 30 percent a year.  As would any supervisor, when I see a product growing 30 percent a year for three years, I tend to get a little nervous about the concentration risk. Where is the liquidity coming from for these? Again, a big chunk of it is going to the securitization markets. I think one of the challenges we have as bank supervisors is that, to the extent the banks are originating these loans with the intent to sell them to the market, they’re looking to the market for the credit definitions. We know from our QIS-4 [Quantitative Impact Study 4] results, looking at the Basel II exercise, that we had a huge disparity in the results on loss expectations on home equity loans and other mortgage products.  A lot of these are new types of products.  The confidence intervals around the expected defaults, I think, are a lot wider for them than for those that have traditional structures. We also know that there’s a lot of correlation risk that could happen here.  If the housing price bubble does break in a market where employment is dropping, people could be leaving an area and we could have more defaults.  In addition, we know that the dropping of home prices, in and of itself, tends to create more defaults, especially with negligible equity in these properties.  Also, to the extent that people default and the banks have more properties to foreclose, there are neighborhood effects, with losses getting bigger when the defaults do occur. So, what I am concerned about from a liquidity perspective, since these are being securitized and moving into the markets—and there is plenty of appetite in the market to take these products— is the lack of discipline relative to previous periods.  In the ancient days, when mortgage loans stayed on the books of financial institutions, liquidity limitations forced them to choose the higher June 29-30, 2005 151 of 234 understands the structure of these loans any better than some of us do in terms of pricing the risk, as evidenced by the S&P move two weeks ago. So, again, I’m not overly concerned.  Especially with the record profits and capital in banks, I think there’s a huge cushion.  But the implications of this for housing wealth and for investors who take the ultimate risk in these securities could create some problems in terms of the way economic growth proceeds going forward.  And it’s something that I think was appropriate to spend the time talking about today."
"71";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  New England continues to expand but probably more slowly than the nation.  At our last meeting, I spoke of a couple of bumps along the road to a stronger regional economy.  Those bumps remain—in particular, rising concerns about slow job growth, rapidly growing input costs, the strength of demand, and the availability of skilled June 29-30, 2005 121 of 234 Moreover, with the base realignment and closure (BRAC) proposals by the Pentagon now public, there are clear challenges to be faced in both Connecticut and Maine, which together bear about half of the related job losses for the whole nation.  While there will be extensive efforts in Washington by New England legislators to modify the BRAC results through the work of the BRAC Commission, judging by the outcome of the last four rounds of base closures, little will change. This will be particularly difficult for Maine, with its smaller and less differentiated economy. And I expect the news of the MBNA/Bank of America merger won’t go over well in Maine either.  So it’s not hard to see why the general tone in New England seems a bit on the soft side. Employment in our District is growing but at a slower pace in May than in the three previous months.  Unemployment has edged up, and most other indicators of economic health show only modest growth.  Indeed, business confidence has trended down sharply, and commercial real estate markets remain sluggish across the region. Regional manufacturers—those contacted for the Beige Book, those who sit on our New England Advisory Council, or those who participate in our economic forums—are for the most part experiencing rising demand and volume growth.  But they view increases in costs as a particular impediment.  They see the costs of raw materials of all sorts, including energy and transport, as problems.  And they believe passing on such costs is difficult, except when they have unique or technologically advanced products.  Many talked about margin pressures and, as compared to the last several meetings, fewer talked about pricing power.  Perhaps this is because energy surcharges already have been implemented and accepted but other pricing changes are proving more difficult. Health care costs are a concern as well.  And the rising costs—or unavailability of—necessary June 29-30, 2005 122 of 234 To end the regional discussion on a little more positive note, there are industries that are clearly doing well. As a generic category, the leisure and hospitality industry is growing.  Tourism is solid and hotel margins are good.  Retailers are more optimistic as well, though the wet weather in May dampened sales [laughter] and caused inventory levels to rise.  Many software companies are facing good demand for their products, and business service firms say that job markets are tightening, especially for technology workers. And I’d have to say that in my 11 years of reading the notes on Beige Book discussions, I’ve never seen a description of the business outlook quite like the one I read in our recent notes, which was, I quote, “Crazy, busting at the seams.”  That was the case for one very large regional producer of aircraft integrated systems.  For this company, demand from the airlines for retrofits and for fuel management and diagnostic systems has taken off, literally.  [Laughter]  So, not everything is growing slowly in New England. Turning to the national scene, there is clear evidence that the economic softening we noted at the last meeting has reversed course, at least partially.  The so-called soft patch in the first quarter is in the process of being revised away with the changes to net exports and inventory levels.  And while the second quarter will suffer some from the unwinding of auto inventories, there does seem to be a solid pattern of underlying growth. Looking further ahead, there is very little difference between our forecast in Boston and that in the Greenbook.  Through late ’05 and into ’06, we continue to see an evolving handoff from policy-stimulated, consumer-led growth to a solid pace of underlying demand led by increased business spending that is being driven by relatively sound fundamentals.  Incoming data, while June 29-30, 2005 123 of 234 We, like the Greenbook, see four-quarter growth rates in both 2005 and 2006 in the mid- threes, unemployment close to the staff’s estimate of full employment, and both core CPI and core PCE edging downward.  This isn’t terribly different from our outlook at the previous meeting.  But while some aspects of the earlier soft patch have gone away, new or perhaps more sharply drawn risks have emerged.  In particular, oil prices continue to surprise on the upside.  This could both dampen growth and contribute more to inflation than we currently expect.  The baseline forecast sees inflation moderating over the next year and a half, but that assumes that oil prices flatten and don’t continue their upward climb. By the end of the forecast period, some slack remains, but there are risks on the upside that resource pressures could occur sooner.  Indeed, some compensation measures may be hinting at this, and slowing productivity could also contribute.  Risks exist on the downside as well, in particular that the drag of higher energy prices will slow worldwide growth even further, working to create greater slack here in the United States. The other major area of risk, as I see it, involves a wide array of asset and financial variables.  We’ve discussed whether there is a housing bubble or just symptoms of froth in some markets.  While much of the rise in house prices can be explained by rising incomes and demographics, low interest rates clearly have been a contributing factor.  They have also contributed to what most market practitioners view as a sense of reaching for risk in markets and to relatively narrow credit spreads.  The complications of some of the newer, more intricate, and untested credit default instruments caused a bit of market turmoil recently.  This was far from a systemic event, but it does I think illustrate the fact that nasty surprises can occur when markets overdo. I found the papers prepared by Vincent and his colleagues on the conundrum of low 10-year June 29-30, 2005 124 of 234 more credence in the low 10-year yield as a signal of increased financial ease rather than potential economic weakness. But the case for both interpretations I thought was well made. For both these major risks—rising oil prices and excesses in asset and financial markets— there are possible downside effects on growth and upside effects on inflation and market volatility. So how should policy react? Or, more pointedly, when should we pause from our “measured pace” to assess where things are? Given the Greenbook forecast and reasonable assumptions about remaining slack, one could look at the downside risks and say that a pause should occur sooner rather than later.  But one could also look at the upside risks and decide a pause should come at a later point.  Frankly, I think the latter course is less costly.  That is, if we err on the side of tighter policy, easing can be done quickly if it’s necessary—and at little relative cost.  Higher rates, if approached sensibly and cautiously, will help to wring out of the system some excesses and protect against unexpected surges in inflation.  If we stay too accommodative for too long, then the price of correction in terms of economic growth may well be higher. But, really, pausing is not the question for today.  I think our best course of action should be to repeat what we’ve done over the last several meetings and move the funds rate up.  I know we’ll have more to say later about the language in the statement, but for now let me emphasize once again that I think saying what we did and why we did it should be enough.  I know there will be no desire to change the statement in any fundamental way until we take a pause or decide to move faster. That may be wise, and it has worked pretty well so far.  But I continue to believe that there is a risk in continuing to imply that we know more than we do about what the future course of policy will need to be. June 29-30, 2005 125 of 234"
"72";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Business activity in the Fourth District has not changed very much during the intermeeting period.  Business conditions in the region are okay, but not great.  Many of the business contacts I talked to report that their business is better in other parts of the country than in our District. Recent credit downgrades of debt issued by GM, Ford, and some of their suppliers have received a lot of attention in the District.  Longer term, companies in the automobile supply chain are bracing for consolidation, as Ford, Daimler-Chrysler, and GM grapple with their cost structures. My District, though, has a number of Honda and Toyota plants and suppliers to those plants.  So the longer-term adjustments in the District are not likely to be quite as severe as in other parts of the Midwest.  Nevertheless, the Fourth District companies that sell to the automobile supply chain are not optimistic about the sales and profitability outlook for that sector.  One banker I talked to confirmed that his customers in the automotive supply chain have become very cautious about their investment spending recently. At the time of our last meeting, my greatest concern was that the pace of real economic June 29-30, 2005 129 of 234 growth has held up fairly well and inflation has held fairly steady.  Nevertheless, I’m not feeling any more confident or certain about the outlook—especially the outlook for inflation—than I was in May. I approached this meeting thinking about inflation in the same way that David Wilcox did in his presentation.  The Greenbook baseline projection for core PCE is close to 2 percent for nearly all of this year and next year and only very slowly returns to my preferred rate of 1½ percent.  And I find this long time frame to be discouraging.  Even more discouraging is the prospect that inflation could very well turn out to be greater than that baseline projection. As David pointed out in his exhibit 6, in early 2004 the Greenbook baseline projection called for core PCE to increase over the four quarters of 2005 at a rate of 1 percent.  By the end of last year, that was moved up to 1½ percent.  Then over the past six months of this year it has been moved up another ½ percentage point to 2 percent.  I’m not repeating these numbers to cast aspersions on the staff projections because, after all, when they were made I thought those were very reasonable projections and I agreed with them.  As a group, we reported to Congress in February that our central tendency projection for core PCE was 1½ percent to 1¾ percent this year and the same for next year.  And, as Steve pointed out this morning, in our preliminary numbers, the projection for core PCE has been moved up to 1¾ to 2 percent for this year and next. I know that I have consistently underestimated inflation.  And now we’re facing oil prices of close to $60 per barrel and there is a risk, I believe, that unit labor costs could trend up.  Assuming that the real side of the economy does hold up, the potential inflationary consequences of these developments give me second thoughts about pausing too soon in our removal of policy accommodation.  But I’ll hold my comments on policy for later on in the meeting.  Thank you, Mr. June 29-30, 2005 130 of 234"
"73";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last FOMC meeting, I worried about a slowdown in growth and a pickup in inflation.  I hypothesized and hoped that both would prove transitory.  On the whole, I consider recent data reassuring that the soft patch in the spring was just that—maybe not even that—and not a precursor of a more entrenched slowdown. While the Greenbook subscribes to the view that the slowdown in growth was transitory, the staff has made an upward revision, by a couple of tenths, to its forecast for core PCE inflation for this year and next year, now projecting inflation of about 2 percent in both years.  I’m a bit less pessimistic on inflation than the staff.  Recent data on core inflation have been pretty good of late. Moreover, I see the fundamentals—namely, the pressures on future inflation—as providing room on balance for some optimism.  The most worrisome factor is that oil prices have risen further, although this should tend to boost core inflation more this year than next year. As David noted, the recent jump in compensation per hour should probably be discounted, since it appears to be due to one-time factors.  On the encouraging side, I see a noticeable decline— about 17 basis points—in inflation compensation at both the 5- and 10-year horizons, high markups, an appreciation in the dollar, a leveling off of commodity prices, very modest increases in the ECI, June 29-30, 2005 132 of 234 The situation with regard to slack, as David noted and emphasized, is complicated because the unemployment rate is relatively low, near most estimates of NAIRU.  But several other measures, as he pointed out and as we also routinely monitor—including the employment-to­ population ratio, capacity utilization, the output gap, and the other indicators that David showed us— do suggest that slack remains. One final point on the inflation outlook is that one of the best forecasters of future inflation is past inflation.  And I’m told that this is a point that was emphasized at a special topic session a couple of years ago. On this score, things look fairly good, with core PCE price inflation at 1.7 percent over the past 12 months. While I guess I can and have quibbled a bit about the inflation outlook for the next year, overall I think the Greenbook forecast seems reasonable.  Real GDP appears poised to grow just slightly above its potential rate, gradually eliminating remaining slack.  And core inflation, while currently near the upper end of my comfort zone, at least to me seems likely to moderate a bit over the next few years. The Greenbook forecast depicts an almost textbook scenario of an economy continuing along the path toward a rather attractive steady state.  Going forward, there are obviously some sizable risks, and I count the unwinding of possible house and bond market bubbles as one or two that are high on my list.  But I think the most likely outcome is—as in the Greenbook projection— that we will continue to move in a positive direction over the next couple of years.  And given what we now know, I think the funds rate path assumed in the Greenbook, which is very close to the market’s current view, is appropriate.  That is, we are likely to need to raise rates a couple more times before slowing the pace of tightening rather substantially.  And I want to emphasize that, in June 29-30, 2005 133 of 234 economy moving along this textbook path during a period characterized by some quite difficult circumstances. I know that Monday’s pre-FOMC briefing emphasized that economic activity has been burdened by some major drags over the past year or so.  These include the oil shock, the deterioration in the trade balance, and the still low level of investment spending relative to GDP. The result is that we’ve had to keep interest rates exceptionally low for a long time, just to get respectable economic growth.  In fact, respectable and not stellar growth is all we have gotten, even with exceptionally low long-term yields and unexpectedly rapid gains in house prices.  And those are two factors that, on their own, would be working to push up the equilibrium real funds rate. So the merely respectable growth in the economy has really rested on the backs of just a few interest rate-sensitive sectors:  business investment, consumer durables, and housing.  From that perspective, it’s really not all that surprising that house prices have risen a great deal, and it’s not surprising to hear our directors and other contacts comment that liquidity is abundant and that lending is taking place for deals that one of our directors simply characterized as “stupid.”  I think he meant by historical standards.  [Laughter]  My point is that to offset the drags, we’ve needed to give the economy a strong dose of stimulus, which inevitably boosted the housing sector—and that just to get reasonable economic growth.  That is equivalent to saying that the equilibrium real fed funds rate is unusually low—1.4 percent in the Greenbook path. So, for me, the policy imperative that follows is that we need to be careful not to overdo the pace of policy tightening.  I noted that in recent months several FOMC members have commented that we usually know we’ve come to the end of the tightening phase when we have tightened one or two times too many.  I think we should be especially attentive to this concern this time around, June 29-30, 2005 134 of 234 John Williams’s analysis yesterday highlighted the fact that if house and/or bond prices fall, the zero bound could become an issue we would be discussing again. To conclude, I’m all for raising the funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting, and I believe the language in the press release should seek to maintain the path for the expected fed funds rate that now exists in the market.  My worry is that unless we’re careful in crafting the language as we raise the rate today—and likely again in August—markets will start to build in more increases in subsequent months than they have so far.  I think we are nearing the point when we will need to start pausing, and I hope we can maintain that expectation in the market in the period ahead."
"74";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050630meeting.csv";"  Thank you. We’re somewhat more confident in the strength and sustainability of the expansion than we were in May.  Our view is very similar to the staff forecast. We expect real GDP growth to average roughly 3½ percent over the forecast period. We expect core PCE to follow a somewhat higher path and to end the forecast period slightly higher than we expected in May, at just under 2 percent. This forecast assumes that we’ll continue to tighten monetary policy, perhaps by a bit more than foreseen in the staff forecast and than is currently priced into the market.  To us, the risks to this forecast seem roughly balanced.  We see no new sources of potential risk.  This is not to say June 29-30, 2005 138 of 234 daunting. It’s worth noting, though, that these risks—from a cliff in housing prices to a sharp increase in household saving, to a larger and more sustained oil shock, to less favorable future productivity outcomes, to a sharp increase in risk premia or to declines in asset prices—in general are risks that we can’t really mitigate substantially ex ante through monetary policy. However, by making sure we get the real fed funds rate up to a more comfortable level we can help.  The alternative strategy, to oversimplify it, would be to follow a softer path for monetary policy to provide a preemptive cushion against the negative effects on employment of a fall in housing prices, a rise in risk premia, some rise in saving and a fall in consumption, and so forth. This would, I believe, be a less prudent strategy. Although there have been persistent concerns about the vulnerability of this expansion and about some of its less robust characteristics, the two most remarkable aspects of this recovery are encouraging. The first is its resilience.  So far, each episode of incipient softness has proved to be shallow in depth and short in duration.  Despite very prolonged and substantial headwinds in the context of an oil shock, a large ongoing drag from net exports, a significant tightening of financial conditions, a modest withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, etc., quarterly GDP growth—as Janet said— has shown impressive stability around a 3½ percent annual rate over the last year and a half.  And this is a dramatic reduction in realized macroeconomic volatility.  It makes the much-heralded “great moderation” look turbulent. The second positive feature of this period has been the behavior of underlying inflation and inflation expectations.  Of course, underlying inflation seems to have moved up a bit, but large changes in oil and commodity prices and import prices have produced periods of substantial acceleration in headline inflation without, at least to this point, causing more than short-lived June 29-30, 2005 139 of 234 The behavior of productivity growth and expectations about future productivity growth explain some of this. Also important, of course, is the credibility engendered by the record of the FOMC.  Changes in the structure of the financial system must matter, too.  There are almost surely other factors—luck for one—that are at work. Among the choices in Vincent Reinhart’s note on interest rates, I’m inclined to support the more benign assessment of the recent behavior of forward interest rates and term premia, even though these factors can’t fully explain those moves, and even though the future may prove to be more volatile and adverse than the markets now seem to expect and than those explanations would imply. So what about monetary policy going forward?  There are two salient dimensions of the forecast. One, of course, is growth slightly above trend from a starting point where the remaining amount of resource slack, if any, is substantially diminished.  The other is an underlying inflation rate—just to focus on the core PCE—that now seems to be running at a modest margin above 1.5 percent and that we expect will end the forecast period above 1.5 percent.  And inflation expectations, at the horizon over which monetary policy operates and with reasonable adjustments to translate them into a view on the PCE deflator, are still some margin above 1.5 percent. We don’t consider this inflation forecast a cause for serious concern.  We anticipate upward pressures on inflation from some firming of compensation growth and from higher unit labor costs. We expect those pressures will face the countervailing forces of relatively moderate inflation expectations, strong competitive pressures, still substantial profit margins, the potential for some increase in the labor force participation rate, and pretty strong expected future productivity growth. And yet it should matter to us that, even in a world where the nominal fed funds rate peaks June 29-30, 2005 140 of 234 meaningfully above 1.5 percent.  The range of estimates in the forecasts and model simulations before us, and the expectations we can derive from the market, place the terminal rate of the nominal fed funds rate now between 3½ and 4½ or between 3¾ and perhaps 4¼ percent.  These estimates have moved down a bit over the last few months, but the shape of the path has steepened a bit. I don’t think we really know how much confidence we can have in these estimates, even if the forecast unfolds as we expect today.  But my view remains that we are better off following a path that would put us at the higher end of these estimates than in taking the risk of doing too little and stopping prematurely or trying to manage the communication challenges of a temporary pause when we still believe we have further to go.  Thank you."
"75";"CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";"  Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, would somebody like to start the general discussion?  President Moskow.,   President Fisher.,   President Yellen.,   President Lacker.,   President Santomero.,   President Stern.,  President Guynn.,   President Minehan.,  May I suggest that if you have ideas or notions about how to change the statement, write a memorandum to the Committee well before the meeting, and the Secretariat will circulate it.,  There’s no reason why you have to wait until the last few days if you have some ideas to suggest.,   You may galvanize the discussion on the relevant issues. Clearly, there is a limited life expectancy for the particular statement we’re using now.  My own judgment is that we may luck out in the sense that the markets will perceive changes that are going on in the economy and will move the forward federal funds rate in a manner that will essentially make our transition to a different status seamless.  But we can’t assume that.  We have to be aware of the fact that we may have to make a very specific judgment. Coffee is available. Why don’t we break and come back in a reasonable time? [Coffee break] August 9, 2005 56 of 110,   President Hoenig.,   President Poole.,   Vice Chair.,   Governor Olson.,  Governor Kohn.,   Governor Bies.,  Governor Ferguson.,  Thank you very much.  Let’s move on to Brian Madigan."
"76";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data show broad-based support for growth, with inflation—at least in the most recent readings—relatively well contained. Final demand seems to be robust, with consumers, housing, and to some degree business investment spending, all making contributions.  No doubt some of these data have been helped by the surprising success of the latest set of incentives from the auto companies, which boosted consumer spending and led to an unexpected slowdown in inventory investment. However, underlying financial conditions, the creation of wealth and jobs, and both consumer and business confidence I think provide a more lasting, sustainable basis to growth going forward. While it’s hard to have a great deal of confidence in the saw-toothed quarterly pattern that we see in the Greenbook, I think the baseline forecast in the longer term is amply supported by the facts. And in my view, a continued execution of our announced policy of a gradual removal of accommodation is in order. However, there were a sufficient number of surprises in the intermeeting period—and, as August 9, 2005 73 of 110 examination of a number of issues.  Given the time, however, I’m going to focus my comments on only one of those. I think the most important issue from a policy perspective is whether it is reasonable to accept, as a basis for today’s decision, the staff’s forecast of inflation stabilizing, albeit at the very upper end of what I believe is this Committee’s acceptable range. The baseline staff view of this relatively benign inflation dynamic can certainly be called into question, given a range of sources of uncertainty and inflation pressures.  Those uncertainties and inflation pressures come from a number of factors: the mixed data that we’ve seen of late on labor compensation; the upward movement in the price of oil; the recent changes over the last several quarters in unit labor costs; and our new understanding that PCE prices were on a steeper upward trajectory and that structural supply-side growth may have been slightly less robust than we had thought before the NIPA revisions. To attempt to answer this question, I sought to validate the Greenbook inflation forecast, and I’d like to hand out some tables that indicate the results of this work.2  What I asked the staff to do was to assess the historical performance of several alternative measures of inflation as predictors of one-year-ahead inflation—CPI inflation in particular.  And here I think I owe a slight apology to Gary, because I came to some statistical conclusions that were somewhat different from his instinctive conclusions. If you look at the table I’ve handed out, the first page shows what is called the root mean squared prediction error of alternative forecasts of one-year-ahead CPI inflation.  The set of forecasts that I looked at is pretty obvious:  the Greenbook, the SPF [Survey of Professional Forecasters] CPI forecast, the CPI random walk, and the median CPI random walk using the Cleveland median CPI.  In the second to leftmost column you’ll see that over a long period— August 9, 2005 74 of 110 from the third quarter of 1981 to the first quarter of 2004—our Greenbook forecast has turned out, at least on this relatively simple measure, to have been the best of the forecasts.  The random walk forecast tends not to be so good, but other forecasters externally have also done pretty well. You can look across the various periods and see that, by and large, the staff forecast tends to be the historical winner. Curiously, as you get to the far right column, which covers the period beginning in 1999, we can add in important information—the compensation from TIPS. Again, I think it gives a relatively good forecast of inflation.  And then the one measure here that is not self-explanatory is the adjusted TIPS. There, our staff has adjusted the TIPS to eliminate the best estimate that we have of the liquidity premium and inflation risk premium based on a term structure model.  And if you look at the adjusted TIPS, at least in the short period of 1999 to 2004, you can see that the adjusted TIPS measure tends to be somewhat better than almost any of the others. So, by and large, we’d say overall that the market seems to have a really good forecasting record in the short term.  And in the longer term, our Greenbook forecast seems to be the best and is probably somewhat better than the random walk. Turning to the second page of the handout, given that background of what we can trust, I think the good news here—again, I had to do this on the CPI forecast—our staff’s CPI forecast seems to be pretty much in the middle.  We are not an outlier.  The other good news, particularly if one trusts the adjusted TIPS information, is that it also seems to be quite consistent with the Greenbook forecast. So I took this to basically say at the end—and I want to be relatively short here, given I’m the last speaker—that we can be reasonably confident in basing our policy today on the Greenbook inflation forecast.  There clearly is an upside risk to that forecast, I think.  But as both other forecasters and a variety of market-based indicators all signal, it would be very August 9, 2005 75 of 110 while there’s obviously some uncertainty, I’d say let’s build our policy approach around the baseline forecast, and let’s continue with the market-accepted approach that we’ve already announced of a gradual removal of our accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"77";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, as reported in the Beige Book, activity in our District has picked up substantially. There’s a tremendous amount of activity in all but the manufacturing sector. And there’s an enormous surge in confidence, particularly in Texas, even though that may seem like a redundancy to talk about confident Texans! I’ll refer to just a couple of points very quickly as part of the broader discussion we’ve been having at this table. First, we’ve had a huge surge in housing starts.  Houston now ranks second in the country year-to-date in terms of housing unit permits, and Dallas ranks third.  First, by the way, is Atlanta. Moreover, permits are running at rates roughly three times what we see in New York City and roughly twice those in Miami or Orlando.  But to illustrate the point that we discussed at our last meeting, in terms of price pressures, Dallas ranks 250 out of 265 MSAs [metropolitan statistical areas], which shows the geographic differential.  In any event, we’ve had August 9, 2005 35 of 110 The second point, with regard to energy, is that Texas, Louisiana, and New Mexico account for two-thirds of the rig count in the United States.  It’s a rather schizophrenic sector. One might say that schizophrenia beats dining alone, because we do get both sides of these arguments.  [Laughter] We have a very excited group of people—the rig operators—now running at the tightest capacity rate in terms of rig utilization since December of 1985 in the case of Texas and since 1986 in the case of Louisiana.  As evidence of the kind of pressure that’s occurring on the happy side, but also a testimony to globalization, we have the first case of a company—a small company that was not able to find rigs—importing a rig with workers from China to operate in a certain basin in Colorado.  By the way, 70 percent of that rig content is constructed in China and 30 percent in the United States.  This is the first such case that we’re aware of. On the opposite side, the depressive side, there is a constant fear of price collapse in the oil sector. One might describe it as a wild surmise, except that one of the most articulate and outspoken champions of the view that oil prices could fall dramatically happens to be Lee Raymond, the Chairman of Exxon and the Chairman of the National Petroleum Council.  He likes to remind listeners, and he lectures me constantly, that in 1985 or 1986—I forget exactly when it was—we had a price collapse which took oil prices from $28 to $10 in two weeks.  He is constantly warning his colleagues—noting that it is a minority view within the oil patch—that if we have a warm winter he expects that kind of price behavior in the oil market.  And he certainly is a noteworthy proponent of that view. On the high-tech side, I’d note a couple of points based on conversations with Texas Instruments and Dell on the issues of capacity and capital expenditures.  TI, having just August 9, 2005 36 of 110 area—says that they expect this to be one of their last full-bore production facilities for wafers. By the way, even with that large dollar investment, the factory will employ only 500 people. What they’re finding now is that they can buy what they call commodity wafers—which is about 60 percent of the content they need—from Chinese producers at ever-lower prices.  Dell repeats the same kind of defiance of the laws of economic behavior, as they put it, in terms of what they’re able to source out of China, and they claim now to be the second largest operator of U.S. companies in China.  Moreover, they report that with each passing day, as we’ve heard from retailers, somebody appears on their doorstep able to outbid any existing supplier at an ever- cheaper price. As far as the retail sector is concerned, again, with my colleague’s permission, I do talk to contacts from Wal-Mart occasionally—to the COO and to the President of Wal-Mart International. We hear the same kinds of reports, and there are substantial questions about Chinese accounting. And, Karen, the reason I asked the question about the assumptions regarding the Chinese yuan appreciation or the general depreciation of the dollar against the yuan—even though it’s obviously very volatile—is that the CEO of Wal-Mart International said that it makes absolutely no difference that China has revalued the renminbi at this juncture. They constantly find that people that will come in and underbid existing suppliers.  The supposition, Mr. Chairman, is that the Chinese (a) don’t pay back principal, (b) don’t pay taxes, and (c) if they do pay taxes, they pay the tax collector rather than the government.  All of that, of course, gives them a substantial advantage.  This has always been the case, and we assume it will be not carried forward over time.  But in terms of competition, there seems to be a voracious appetite to continue to supply—a variation of the old Communist model in which they produced August 9, 2005 37 of 110 retailers, our high-tech sector, and others, and now our energy sector—are taking advantage of that situation. Having said all of that, I want to indicate, as did Mr. Moskow, that with this strong economic activity, even though there may be a risk that we’re borrowing from the future, we, too, are concerned about inflationary pressures.  So we would be in favor of further tightening to the degree that my former colleague as Deputy U.S. Trade Representative just mentioned.  We’ll talk about the wording of the statement later.  Thank you very much."
"78";"MR. GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like everyone else, we think growth has strengthened since our last meeting.  We’re going into the second half with more forward momentum, and this has been accompanied by a broad-based improvement in confidence about the outlook. We expect a stronger second half of ’05 than we did at the last meeting.  But our forecast for next year remains essentially unchanged, with real GDP growth still a bit above potential—we think around 3½ percent—and the core PCE deflator at around 2 percent.  On the August 9, 2005 62 of 110 the risks around this forecast seem broadly balanced to us, with perhaps a slightly greater probability of outcomes on the higher side. As this implies, we’re very comfortable with the basic Greenbook view, the story behind that view, and the evolution in the estimated output gap the Greenbook expects.  I guess the one qualification I’d mention is that we don’t see a strong case yet for as significant a downward revision in our estimate of potential growth or actual growth in ’06. The fundamentals supporting consumption and investment growth still seem intact. Underlying productivity growth still seems fairly good.  Real yields appear to have increased materially, and equity prices, credit spreads, and risk premia generally suggest a pretty favorable view of this expansion and its durability.  Our various surveys of sentiment, formal and less formal, support this more positive view of the national outlook. We think the underlying inflation rate is following a slightly higher trajectory than we thought at the last meeting, and we think a lot of the forces at work in the economy that we have discussed today will continue to put some upward pressure on the inflation rate going forward. But we don’t expect a significant acceleration in inflation above this 2 percent band, and that view, of course, is consistent with the moderation in inflation expectations we’ve seen since the start of the year. However, even this relatively modest path leaves us some margin above the 1½ percent pace for the core PCE that we believe should be our objective over time.  And, of course, even this forecast of 2 percent could prove to be too benign. All of this suggests that we should try to design our monetary policy signal to achieve three objectives.  These will be familiar objectives.  First, we should reinforce the sense that the fed funds rate needs to move higher for us to achieve our price stability objective.  Second, we August 9, 2005 63 of 110 evolves. We want to ensure that expectations of policy continue to be responsive to changes in the forecast, and we want to make sure that we have the flexibility to alter the trajectory as appropriate. It’s important in this regard that we not give the market more certainty about the future path of the fed funds rate than we can reasonably expect to have ourselves.  I think we also want to avoid conveying the sense that our task is simply to get to neutral, that we’re confident in our estimates of what neutral is, and that we’re unlikely to need to move beyond that point.  Even if the data continue to support this very favorable forecast we all seem to share, we may find it increasingly difficult to decide how far we’ll need to move.  And, finally, given the move up since June in the market’s expectation of the fed funds rate path, I think we should try to leave the expected future path of the fed funds rate largely unchanged today—or perhaps a bit firmer. But I don’t see any reason now to try to induce, or to take the risk of inducing, a major shift in current expectations. Thank you."
"79";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Consistent with incoming data on the national economy, business conditions in our part of the Southeast have remained positive since our last meeting.  In fact, I found it more difficult than usual to answer the questions: “What has changed?” and “What are we seeing and hearing in the region that might help inform national trends in our policy discussion?” So, uncharacteristically, I will highlight just one regional issue—one I’ve talked about a great deal and one which I still think is especially important—and that is the extraordinary pace of home building and sales in some of our markets in the Southeast.  It may be wishful thinking on my part, but one gets the sense that things may—and I emphasize may—have begun to show some signs of cooling.  Although home building remained at high levels over the most recent period, reports from builders in our area were a bit more mixed, and some modest deceleration was noted in a few Florida markets.  Most interesting, our bank examiners are now reporting that some of the large regional banks are beginning to exercise a new caution in their real estate lending, and some have gone so far as to actually stop development and construction lending in certain areas of Florida. I find this appropriate and encouraging.  Of course, the fact that permanent mortgage rates remain relatively low, even with the recent uptick, is probably still the greatest stimulus to the extraordinary and prolonged housing boom.  But I hope my sense of August 9, 2005 48 of 110 Turning to the national economy, I’ll also focus on just a couple of areas and their policy implications, and I think all of those have already been referenced in the question period or by others. The first is that the growth in output has, if anything, been somewhat stronger recently than I expected, even though the NIPA revisions tell us that the economy was on a somewhat lower growth path than we had thought. Others may not share my view, but I think that I, and probably we, have more often than not tended to underestimate and underforecast output growth. We may be acknowledging that again based on the fact that most forecasts, including the Greenbook, have been revised up for the remainder of the year.  I believe it was President Stern, and I think he just confirmed this, who reminded us once—and maybe more than once earlier in the expansion when we were getting uneasy—to have faith, and he seems to have been right. I’m also perhaps more sensitive than some to what we now know from the data revisions that show us the higher levels of inflation in the recent quarters.  I recognize that the upward revisions on the core PCE series were in the imputed prices.  Nonetheless, the level of measured inflation has gotten closer to the upper bounds of my comfort level, as well that of others, and I think we should be more sensitive to forces that could, despite the most recent monthly data that have been encouraging, exert upward pressure on prices in the period ahead. Although I did not go back and check, I would guess that the adjustment in the estimated output gap reflected in today’s Greenbook was one of the largest between-meeting adjustments in quite some time.  Although I don’t find the output gap framework especially helpful, the rapid closure in that measure suggests to me that upward inflation pressures could be more imminent. Of course, the Greenbook’s “more room to grow” alternative scenario could give one comfort, but I do not find that possibility compelling, because such an outcome hinges critically August 9, 2005 49 of 110 participation rate. I’m not convinced that is a reasonable view.  I’m concerned for two reasons. First, it is not clear that the failure of labor force participation rates to rebound following the recession means that slack in the economy is greater than is reflected currently in the unemployment rate.  Our Atlanta staff’s recent research indicates—when one controls for changes in worker characteristics, changes in individual behavior and preferences, and for differences in the economic environment—that labor force participation rates are not likely to return anytime soon to the peak level seen in 2000. Second, looking at the upcoming changes in labor market demographics that will hit the economy as soon as next year, we will have to change substantially how we think about labor markets and job creation in our economy.  If I read the data correctly, projections by the BLS [Bureau of Labor Statistics] and Social Security Administration show that nearly 400,000 more workers will retire in 2006 than will enter the labor market.  That trend will accelerate year by year, as more and more baby boomers reach retirement age.  It is unlikely to be completely offset by increases we might see in older worker labor force participation. The cumulative deficit in workers could reach nearly two million in 2009 and four million in 2011.  I think we all know our economy will find ways to deal with these significant changes. But given this forward-looking perspective, I am not terribly worried about slack in the labor market.  Further, not far down the road I think we will find ourselves concerned about where the workers will come from, especially if the economy continues to create jobs—even at the current pace.  Not only do we have to revamp some aspects of how we think about the economy, but we also must be mindful of the pressures that will bring to do things differently. August 9, 2005 50 of 110 When it comes to the policy discussion, I think we should be sure that we’re comfortable, after taking account of the very latest information on growth, productivity, and inflation that we’ve gotten over the last couple of weeks, with the phrase in the alternative B draft statement that characterizes labor market conditions as continuing to improve only “gradually” and the phrase that says “core inflation has been relatively low.”  It seems to me that we should not do or say anything today that could counter market expectations that we now have a somewhat greater upside risk to inflation and that we still have unnecessary policy accommodation to remove. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"80";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, let me start with some thoughts on the national economy. I do expect growth in real GDP to average about 3¾ percent this year and 3½ percent next year. While this is somewhat slower than last year, it remains above trend.  And the monetary policy and financial conditions currently in place I think are poised to support continued above-trend growth. With growth above trend, the output gap and labor market slack will further diminish. In fact, the economy appears to be at or near full employment now, which is all the more reason to have the federal funds rate above its current level. I’d like to turn for a bit to developments in our region, because the evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this strong outlook.  For example, economic growth has strengthened rather noticeably since our last meeting.  Employment continued to expand, and in the intermeeting period businesses announced substantially more new hires than layoffs in our August 9, 2005 58 of 110 rebounded, and tourist activity showed no effect that we could notice from higher gasoline prices. In addition, energy held steady in terms of high levels of demand.  Drilling has slowed in the mature oil and gas fields of Oklahoma but has continued to grow strongly in newer fields in the Rocky Mountain region. Drilling in those areas continued to be constrained by a shortage of equipment and labor.  As a result—and I’ll repeat what Richard said—one Denver-based energy company has ordered two Chinese rigs and rig crews for delivery this fall as well as several additional rigs for the coming couple of years. While manufacturing activity expanded at a slower pace than in the spring, most firms are optimistic about future sales and plan more hiring and investment to meet the increased demand.  A wide range of District businesses also reported sharply improved earnings due to strong revenue growth systematically in our region.  The only negative news on this level was that commercial real estate markets continued to show only modest improvement and that inventories of unsold homes were up noticeably in some of our cities. I think it is worth noting that a sizable area of extreme drought has developed throughout the central Corn Belt states. The drought affects much of Missouri and Illinois and parts of Wisconsin and Indiana.  Markets currently expect the nation’s corn crop to drop 10 percent and the soybean crop to drop 4 percent. As a result, corn and soybean prices have both risen about 13 percent since their planting.  The USDA crop report that will come out later this week, on August 12th, could trigger a further rally in prices if drought damage is greater than the market currently expects. Turning to inflation, I think it is worth noting that core PCE inflation, as we discussed August 9, 2005 59 of 110 at that pace next year. While we continue to talk about this as being moderate, I think it is important to recognize that it represents a continued upward adjustment of the inflation outlook and is at the higher end of what most of us have indicated we are comfortable with.  I also remain concerned about the upward pressure on inflation.  First, there is an upside risk from higher energy prices and dollar depreciation.  In addition, the real fed funds rate, using the core PCE inflation, is only 1.2 percent.  These factors, I think, pose an upside risk to inflation, especially when combined with growth that remains above trend and an output gap that is small and approaching zero. I believe we are now at a point where the upside risk to the economy is greater than the downside risk.  And while we appear committed to moving only 25 basis points today, and I think the market would be surprised if we did otherwise, we ought to at least seriously consider eliminating any reference to “measured pace” in our statement.  To me it was noticeable in listening to David today that, as we talk about the economy, potential is less than we expected, demand is greater than expected, inflation is greater than we anticipated, and monetary policy is probably 100 basis points below what most people think it should be.  In my view, it’s time to think about changing our statement.  Thank you."
"81";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have remarked, underlying demand has shown a surprising degree of vigor over the intermeeting period.  Strength in final demand should show through to output as the mini-inventory cycle works itself out.  This strength, together with revisions to estimates of the level and rate of growth of potential GDP as a consequence of the NIPA revisions, suggests that the economy is probably a little closer to its long-run sustainable production than we had thought.  A smaller output gap, in combination with further increases in oil prices—some portion of which is likely to show through to core prices for a time—in turn suggests that inflation risks are a little higher and raises questions about our policy strategy. In my view, although the risks have shifted a little, they have not shifted enough to throw us off our presumed policy path of measured increases in interest rates, and I would continue to indicate that in our statement. I agree with the staff forecast that the increase in final demand is likely to slow going forward, as we continue to raise rates. The surprise was not in investment, which continues to be August 9, 2005 67 of 110 strong. In part, the unexpected strength reflected auto incentives and is borrowed from spending in the future. The increase in consumption required a further decline in the saving rate from an already low level, a pattern not likely to be sustained absent continued very sharp increases in housing prices. In that regard, at some point rising short-term rates—and recently long-term rates —should take their toll on housing price appreciation.  To be sure, to date the indications of cooling housing markets are anecdotal, such as those we heard from President Guynn; they’re not yet data-based. But if, as many assert, the demand for houses is being supported to a considerable extent by ARMs and exotic mortgages tied to short-term rates, the effect of monetary policy tightening should, if anything, be greater than in the past, with the housing wealth channel bearing more of the adjustment. In addition, the further rise in energy prices is likely to shave something off spending, or at least postpone the time when energy prices are no longer holding back growth.  And the positive contribution to final sales from net exports in the second quarter appears to be a short- term quirk in either data or behavior.  Moderate growth abroad, together with our outsized demand for imports, should once again begin to damp demand on our own productive resources. Moreover, incoming data on prices and compensation continue to indicate, to my mind, that there is some slack remaining, which is working to contain price pressures.  Although core PCE data for 2004 and before were revised higher, incoming information about the most recent several months has suggested an appreciable short-term deceleration.  The recent price data were, in fact, lower than anticipated.  In effect, the data tended to confirm that the higher rates of inflation earlier this year were temporary, probably reflecting the increases in price levels of oil and other imports, and that inflation is not on an upward track.  These data have been consistent August 9, 2005 68 of 110 have been contradictory and confounding, but it seems hard to believe that the surprisingly soft numbers for the ECI in Q2 and Q1 were drawn from a labor market under pressure, perhaps giving some more weight to President Poole’s comments on the anecdotal information there. Even the productivity numbers are somewhat ambiguous in their implications for cost and price pressures. Although past productivity growth appears to have been lower, and the staff marked down its estimate of structural productivity growth for 2005 and beyond, actual productivity data for 2005 are running at a higher rate than had previously been anticipated.  The estimate for the first half of the year was revised up to 2½ percent, and the current quarter is projected to be substantially higher than that. Market participants seem to think the measured pace of policy tightening will be adequate. They have added to the extent of the tightening but not the pace.  And inflation compensation, as President Lacker noted, while edging a little higher over the intermeeting period, remains much lower than it was just a few months ago, despite the further increase in energy prices. Finally, I think the strategy we have followed of tightening at a measured pace and being transparent about our intentions has a number of advantages.  In particular, following this strategy—especially compared to one of larger increases or those that weren’t well predicted by the market—reduces the odds of significant overshooting.  Gradual changes enable us to get a better handle on their effects on the markets and the economy as they are happening.  Their predictability means that they are incorporated into financial conditions more readily and accurately, bringing forward their effects on financial conditions and making observations about August 9, 2005 69 of 110 And I wonder whether this strategy isn’t going to be especially useful given the uncertainty about how our actions could affect housing prices, construction, and consumption. Increasing rates will affect housing markets. Indeed, that’s a necessary condition for constraining inflation pressures. But increased uncertainty about the strength of this channel, given the changing nature of mortgage markets, reinforces the arguments for a gradual approach to policy, if possible. I agree that the incoming data should reinforce and strengthen our intention not to allow inflation and inflation expectations to rise from here.  I’m encouraged by the reaction of markets to the news over the intermeeting period in adding 50 basis points to the string of expected gradual increases in the funds rate. This shows that they are not constrained by our language from marking up long-term interest rates, and it strikes me as the right response, at least for now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"82";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming economic data since our last meeting have been consistent with a reasonably paced recovery and well-contained inflation. Payroll employment has been solid.  It has even accelerated a bit lately, indicating steady improvement in overall labor market conditions.  The ISM [Institute for Supply Management], industrial production, retail sales, and durable goods orders all came in stronger than anticipated, and the GDP report exceeded what was expected in the June Greenbook. The recent strength in business investment bodes well, I think, for the ability of that sector to take the baton from the housing market should it wane.  For now, though, households seem confident enough in future income prospects to continue to expand spending, particularly on durable goods and housing. Thus, the outlook for the remainder of the year is brighter now, August 9, 2005 41 of 110 Our information on the Fifth District’s economy is broadly consistent with the national outlook. Retail sales picked up markedly in July, as shopper traffic and big-ticket indicators both rose significantly. Employment growth in the sector seemed to moderate last month, however, unlike the national figure. In the service sector outside of retail, revenue growth picked up and employment continued to expand at a steady pace. Manufacturing shipments rose modestly in July, but new orders declined.  Excluding the ailing textile industry, things look much better but still registered a bit of a slowdown in July. Employment in manufacturing continues to decline.  Our surveys indicate that price pressures remain well contained in our District in both the manufacturing and service sectors.  And the housing market in our District remains quite robust. In response to the stronger real outlook, the yield curve has shifted up significantly.  The 10-year Treasury yield has risen over 40 basis points since just before the June meeting, and the 5-year yield rose 47 basis points as of a couple of days ago. Market participants are now expecting substantially more tightening this year and next year—an assessment with which the Greenbook concurs. The federal funds rate is now expected to reach 4¼ percent by mid-2006, an upward revision of about 50 basis points since our last meeting. In comparison, inflation expectations have been remarkably stable.  Inflation compensation, as measured from the TIPS [Treasury inflation-protected securities] curve, has increased only 5 basis points at the 10-year horizon since the June meeting and has actually fallen at the 5-year horizon—and this despite the fact that oil prices have risen substantially on net. It’s quite striking that the stronger real outlook over the intermeeting period has led to August 9, 2005 42 of 110 expectations are obviously a good thing, although they are stabilized right now at the upper end of my comfort zone and I’d be happier if they were ½ point lower.  What’s really impressive, though, is the public’s belief that we will move the funds rate by whatever amount necessary to prevent stronger real prospects from showing through to future inflation.  Our past behavior and communications evidently have given people a fair amount of confidence that we will allow short-term real rates to fluctuate as needed in response to changing fundamentals. This, Mr. Chairman, was the idea behind the question I asked you earlier.  The issue is whether the economy might be able to withstand fluctuations in capacity utilization or the output gap, or however we measure it, without necessarily having these real relative price changes that are naturally going to occur in that circumstance pass through to overall inflation.  This implies, however, a fairly flexible outlook for policy rates, even if market measures of expected inflation do not move around very much.  I think one of the most important challenges we are going to face over the next year or so will be to preserve and enhance this confidence the public has in the responsiveness of policy to evolving economic fundamentals.  Thank you."
"83";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There haven’t been many changes in our region since the last meeting, so I’ll keep my comments about our region brief. Business conditions around the Seventh District are generally good, although we still lag the nation. Labor markets continue to improve gradually, and inflationary pressures remain moderate. Many of our contacts remarked that growth has come down from last year’s pace, but they’ve also acknowledged that last year was unsustainably strong and that the current moderate pace is more in line with long-run trends. Finally, Michigan is still struggling, due to its heavy reliance on the Big Three automakers.  The Big Three indicated that the reaction to their latest incentives, which succeeded in pulling down inventory significantly, as David mentioned, was larger than they had expected. Nonetheless, they told us they were only raising their sales outlook for the year as a whole by 100,000 or 200,000 units. They also said that they would be fairly conservative about increasing production; this gets to the payback we talked about before. Turning to the national outlook, the recent data confirmed that the economy is on solid footing. We expect growth to be somewhat above potential over the rest of this year.  This represents a modest strengthening of our forecast since June.  And with the unemployment rate at 5 percent, it is likely that the current degree of resource slack is small.  The moderation in the recent monthly core inflation data is a positive development.  However, the upward revisions to core PCE inflation are a serious concern.  Apparently, inflationary pressures were higher than we August 9, 2005 33 of 110 At our last meeting, I was concerned about the possibility of core inflation running above 2 percent sometime over the next couple of years.  Now it turns out that we’ve already been having inflation at that pace.  This, of course, includes both market and nonmarket inflation but I don’t think you can discount the nonmarket inflation.  As Janet said, we now have additional data. And I think the point is, in reference to Tom’s question, that the forecast for core inflation has changed now. It used to be that inflation in 2006 was coming down from the rate in 2005, and now, of course, it’s going up. Looking ahead, given the policy assumption in the Greenbook, we think the inflation forecast is reasonable and that the risks to the outlook are balanced.  But I am uncomfortable with the outlook. I’d like to see inflation stabilizing below 2 percent much sooner.  I agreed strongly with the Chairman’s arguments at the last meeting about the asymmetric policy costs surrounding the inflation forecast. And at the higher rates now built into the Greenbook, we could face an even greater risk of a disappointing increase in inflationary expectations.  In that case, reestablishing price stability would require much tighter policy than markets currently expect. I’m also concerned about the large amount of liquidity chasing financial deals.  In the early stages of our accommodative policy, businesses were extremely cautious and many capital investments were deferred.  Liquidity flowed into mortgages and into housing.  Now corporations are flush with cash, competition among lenders is intense, money is flowing rapidly into private equity funds, and banks continue to relax lending terms.  I think we may be approaching the point in the lending cycle where investors tend to overreach and make bad August 9, 2005 34 of 110 And given firms’ buffers of cash, I don’t see much risk of choking off productive investment projects if we raise rates to levels somewhat higher than markets currently expect. So how does this all add up?  Given the good prospects for growth, but with some asymmetric policy risks, I continue to think that we should raise rates until we are comfortably in the middle of the neutral range.  To me, this means reaching a fed funds rate of about 4½ percent before we pause. Of course, we will continue to watch the incoming data.  If either inflation or growth comes in much lower than expected, we can stop earlier—or we can do more if necessary. Finally, it’s pretty safe to say that this is not the meeting for us to change our policy strategy. So I favor a 25 basis point increase today, and I’ll hold off my comments on the language until later."
"84";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  August of the off-election year is a time when we can take stock of how the Congress has responded to certain issues.  As we began this year hopeful that Congress would address some issues that had important fiscal policy implications, I think now is an appropriate time to review to see what impact Congress’s actions will have and the implications for our deliberations. That sense of timing was heightened in recent weeks when we got a mix of very positive and very negative news. The positive news was the 14 percent increase in receipts that the federal government has experienced thus far this year combined with the increase in payments of slightly under 7 percent. That has had the net effect of reducing the expected 2005 deficit by August 9, 2005 64 of 110 subsequent years have also been reduced.  That sequence and the provisions of it were very well documented in the Greenbook and particularly in Part 2 of the Greenbook. On the other hand, just before Congress left town they passed a transportation bill that was loaded with pork, and it also contained numerous gimmicks—there’s no other way to say it—that allowed them to ignore their own budgetary guidelines.  And that passed with only eight dissenting votes in the House, which was very discouraging to anybody who is expecting to see some fiscal austerity. Unlike most of you, I’ve spent most of my public life involved with fiscal issues as opposed to monetary issues. So it’s somewhat disappointing to me that my arrival on the Board coincided with the departure of fiscal discipline at the Congress.  [Laughter] As the year started, there were a number of issues on which there seemed to be a sense of resolve that they would be addressed.  In particular, Social Security was high on the agenda for this Administration.  There was a recognition that Medicare and Medicaid issues were of growing concern and certainly more problematic.  There was a desire to achieve some fundamental changes in income tax policy, and there were some other unresolved issues relating to either taxes or funding, particularly pension reform.  The President began by announcing that he was going to—I believe he said “spend” but I think he meant “apply”—some of his political capital to the Social Security issue.  Initially there was a very strong push on that but as of now— at the August recess—there seems little likelihood of action this year or perhaps even by this Congress. The hope is, if there’s anything with respect to Social Security, that the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee could package it in some way with other policy issues that have some momentum.  So they might be able to move it as a package, but separately and August 9, 2005 65 of 110 With respect to tax policy, the President did appoint an advisory committee on tax reform that has been meeting.  I know our Chairman spoke to that group, as have others, and that committee is expecting to produce a report by September 30.  Even though the report deadline seems to be in place still, the substance of what they are going to produce is not yet fully in place. However, the public statements by several of the members have indicated some of the issues that will be included.  Three in particular will be fairly thoroughly vetted.  One would involve a revision of the existing income tax code, highlighting the necessity of dealing in particular with the alternative minimum tax.  Currently the alternative minimum tax hits about 4 percent of taxpayers; within five years, it will be up to 20 percent of taxpayers.  The cost of a repeal of the alternative minimum tax could be anywhere from $600 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next decade.  So for each year that addressing it gets postponed, the cost gets much higher. That certainly will be considered.  A value-added tax also will be given some consideration, as will some sort of a consumption tax. What will not be produced is a report that is in the form of legislation.  I’m told by some that the report will be neither a legislative proposal nor a textbook.  It will be a report that discusses tax options that hopefully will keep the burden relatively neutral with respect to where it is at this point.  Because it will not be in the form of legislation, it will not become an active legislative issue any earlier than the spring, and maybe late spring, of 2006.  Therefore, it’s unlikely to be considered any time within the next Congress.  Among other issues that are still outstanding, of course, are some other tax issues and the absence of funding of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. In summary, the long and short in my view is that we will not see relief on the fiscal side. August 9, 2005 66 of 110 less severe, I think, during the time when the economy was soft.  The deficit spending, in fact, was stimulative at a time when stimulus was welcome.  As we get closer to equilibrium, it seems to me that that changes. So, it seems to me that at the very least we will be proceeding with an absence of fiscal discipline.  What that will mean, among other things, is that it will add pressure, I would think, to the external funding of our current account deficit.  And it will certainly raise questions as to the willingness and the appetite of the U.S. Congress and the U.S. people for maintaining a stable economy and a stable currency.  Thank you."
"85";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My contacts led off almost universally with comments such as: “Things look great;” “Everything is steady-as-she-goes;” and “All business areas are strong.”  And I’d just like to fill in a few observations here. My Wal-Mart contact—and as I think you know, Wal-Mart has been very concerned about the drain on purchasing power because of gasoline prices—said that they now believe that August 9, 2005 60 of 110 product mix that was too skewed toward the low end, and the part of the income distribution that buys the low end merchandise is still struggling with gasoline prices.  So, to some extent, their overall sales performance last year was simply a consequence of the mix of goods that they had on their shelves. They have changed that mix of goods.  He used as an example the fact that 22 percent of the TVs they’re selling now are high definition digital TVs.  That’s a rather big percentage for a company like Wal-Mart. An interesting comment from my UPS contact was that they are now struggling to obtain enough aircraft, in good part because of their expansion in China.  That expansion is not just in the import/export business—they’re entering the internal Chinese market.  He said that they have no aircraft available either for purchase or lease until 2008.  UPS and FedEx both have filled out their fleets to a very considerable extent by taking aging passenger aircraft and converting them. But the converters are all working at capacity.  So, UPS will keep in service aircraft that are 30 to 40 years old. Obviously, those planes are much more expensive to operate, and UPS would like to replace them with new aircraft but will make do with these older ones.  Both UPS and FedEx said that they’re expecting a very good holiday season, but they anticipate having plenty of capacity. A contact with a major software company said that they’re a little skittish—“very cautious” was the term he used—about the large enterprise business but that other sectors of their business are doing quite well. It seems to me clear that the economy has a very good head of steam.  I would argue that monetary policy is not highly expansionary at this point.  Rates have gone up a lot, and the market anticipates that rates will continue to go up.  I’m one of the few people, I guess, who look August 9, 2005 61 of 110 [laughter] MZM is up by slightly more than 1 percent in the last year and has been about flat in the last six months. M2 is up a bit less than 4 percent.  That’s not consistent with highly expansionary monetary policy. I would say, however, that there is a disconnect arising between the anecdotal reports and the econometric estimates and analysis on the state of the labor market.  When I talk to contacts in my District, they say over and over again that they have no problem with labor availability and that there is no wage pressure, except in isolated cases.  For example, my UPS friend said that they are having ongoing negotiations with the Teamsters and are seeing some job actions.  So there may be some issue there.  But except for a few scattered examples—such as truck drivers, as I’ve mentioned before—my contacts say that they just don’t see any problem with labor availability. And that’s not just at the low end, but at all skill levels, though there may still be some problems hiring accountants.  But even that’s not something that they bring up voluntarily when I talk with them.  Again, they see no significant wage pressures.  So I think there’s a disconnect here between the anecdotal information and the econometric information.  I don’t know what to do about it, but I’d make note of it.  [Laughter] Thank you."
"86";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As expected, the economic softening we saw in the Third District in late spring was temporary, and economic conditions in the region have strengthened since our last meeting.  Retail sales in the District, which had fallen in May, improved in June and early July.  We saw gains in most categories, especially seasonal items, apparel, and home furnishings.  Like elsewhere in the nation, strong auto sales led the way.  Our dealers report that their inventories are now at desired levels, but many are concerned that sales August 9, 2005 43 of 110 While retail sales have regained some strength over the past month, high gasoline prices are beginning to impact consumer behavior.  Our dealers report a shift away from SUVs—that’s a plus as far as I’m concerned [laughter]—to vehicles with higher fuel economy.  We’ve also had reports that shoppers were visiting stores less frequently, consolidating shopping to economize on gasoline expenditures. Manufacturing activity in the District also has improved since June, although it remains more subdued than last year. The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey rose to 9.6 in July, up from minus 2.2 in June.  That’s quite a large swing in the index, and it is true that the volatility of the index has increased this year.  But a staff analysis indicates that the level of volatility remains low by historical standards and that the index continues to be a good indicator of changes in the manufacturing component of the industrial production index. The more forward-looking indicators in the survey, including the indexes on new orders and shipments, also showed modest improvement in July.  Activity in other sectors of the District’s economy continued to expand in line with recent trends.  Payroll employment growth in the region accelerated to 1.5 percent in the second quarter, somewhat weaker than the nation’s pace of 1.8 percent.  Regional unemployment continues to trend down in most of the District’s labor markets.  The three-state unemployment rate fell from 4.8 percent in the first quarter to 4.5 percent in the second quarter.  Only six of the District’s sixteen labor markets had unemployment rates above 5 percent in June. The residential housing sector continues to show strength.  Construction and home sales were up on a year-over-year basis in the three-state region.  House price appreciation continues and is especially strong in New Jersey. The downward trend in nonresidential construction August 9, 2005 44 of 110 first quarter, especially in center city Philadelphia.  The demand for commercial space continues to expand at a slow but steady pace in Philadelphia, but vacancy rates remain at nearly 17 percent. News on the regional inflation front has improved somewhat.  Consumer price inflation in the region is still running at a stronger pace than in the nation, due mainly to stronger increases in owner equivalent rents.  But it’s down from the pace we saw earlier in the year. Increases in wages and benefits in the Northeast have also moderated, although some of our business contacts report that they are planning higher salary increases for next year.  A manufacturing survey indicates there has also been a moderation in industrial price pressure this year. Although the prices paid and prices received indexes remain elevated, much of the significant increase in the indexes seen last year has been worked off. In summary, after a temporary lull in activity this spring, economic conditions in the Third District have strengthened and the outlook is positive.  Regional business contacts remain upbeat and expect the region’s economy to continue to expand in line with the recent trend. Incoming data suggest that the national economy has also regained momentum since our last meeting.  The data reports received over the intermeeting period on most sectors have come in better than expected. At our previous meeting, I argued that it was premature to conclude that the softer data we were getting at the time pointed to the beginning of a persistent downturn. Rather, I interpreted it as part of the fits and starts we usually see as the economy approaches equilibrium.  Similarly, I believe it is now premature to conclude that the faster growth in final demand we saw in the second quarter will necessarily persist. However, I think we need to be particularly watchful at this point to ensure that we don’t August 9, 2005 45 of 110 that aggregate demand may be growing above potential at a time when little slack remains in product and labor markets.  So we must remain vigilant. It is true that the most recent monthly measures of inflation have moderated, and the revised data on core PCE suggest that it has not accelerated this year. Still, the levels of inflation are significantly higher than previously measured, and the benchmark revisions in the GDP report suggest that less capital deepening has occurred.  The latter implies somewhat weaker structural productivity growth going forward and more inflation pressures.  In our current economic situation, therefore, it is my view that we must continue on our path of removing monetary policy accommodation. As for the announcement we use to explain our action, we should point out the strengthening that has occurred in economic conditions since our last meeting and the fact that the inflation pressures are indeed elevated. Appropriately wording the rationale part of the statement will ensure that we have substantive policy flexibility at future meetings, even if we decide to make no change in the assessment-of-risk paragraph today.  In fact, to me a better time to change these paragraphs is when we think a significant change in policy action is called for.  I don’t think that time is today, but it may be getting closer.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"87";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economy continues to track the national economy quite closely, as it has for a long time.  And as I commented at the last meeting, what is striking about the District economy right now is the breadth of the economic expansion. Virtually all sectors are either strong or improving, and I won’t go through a review August 9, 2005 46 of 110 improving employment conditions, wage increases still remain quite modest, as best I can judge. And inflationary pressures haven’t changed, as best I can assess the situation. As far as the national economy is concerned, we’re now almost four years into the current economic expansion and, overall, things look quite good to me.  That in a way is remarkable in and of itself, as I think of the conversations we’ve had around this table over the last four years and the variety of concerns and issues that were raised.  To be sure, policy has played a role in supporting this economic performance but, as I’ve commented before, I think once again we are observing the fundamental soundness, resilience, and flexibility of the economy. The situation is starting to resemble in broad terms, in my mind at least, the long expansions of the ’80s and ’90s.  In fact, without stretching too far, I think one could perhaps make the case that the situation is even a little better than a few years into those expansions. After all, today we have low interest rates, low inflation rates, well-anchored inflationary expectations, for the most part a fairly well-balanced domestic economy, and what I might call a promising international economy.  I call it promising not because I’m thinking about Europe or Japan, but because I’m thinking about China and India and some of their smaller brethren. There are some issues, to be sure.  One is oil prices, which have already been mentioned today. The federal budget situation is another one, although I think that’s more a secular than a cyclical problem.  And then there are housing prices.  All I would say there is that even if there is a bubble, and even if it bursts, the quantitative significance of that remains quite unclear, as far as I’m concerned. I do think we need to pay considerable attention, as we have been, to the inflation situation, but my sense of the situation is that there is no significant deterioration under way or August 9, 2005 47 of 110 forecasting inflation. It has worked remarkably well for a good number of years now. [Laughter] Having said that, I do think it’s appropriate to continue with the policy path we’ve been on. That seems, given the way the economy has evolved, fully appropriate to me."
"88";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus my comments today on some macroeconomic perspectives and on what we’re learning in the supervisory reviews of mortgage products that we and other regulators are undertaking now. On the positive side, when we look at the large volume of ARMs in existence, most of them are of the traditional form.  And currently those ARMs are at a point—whether they’re adjusted annually or they started out as 3-year fixed-rate loans and then move to annual adjustments—where they will be reset.  For the ones that started out in 2002 with fixed rates for three years, this is the year when they will go to annual resets.  We know all of them, since they’re indexed to short-term rates, are going to have a big increase whenever their anniversary August 9, 2005 70 of 110 To the extent that long mortgage rates or the reindexed rates are very close to those available to most borrowers on refinancings, it looks as if most of these ARMs can be converted into a fixed-rate product without a large amount of payment adjustment.  There will be some, but it seems likely to be manageable for many of these borrowers. On the other hand, we’re seeing a lot of subprime ARMs where this may not be true.  As you know, those ARM products that have been pushed into the subprime market are much more problematic.  So the affordability for that group of customers is questionable.  They are going to be hit not only by higher gas prices but higher monthly mortgage payments when their rates are reset. And that is going to be more of an issue as we go forward and as we continue to raise short-term interest rates. Also, I’m a bit more pessimistic about what is happening with regard to some of these option ARMs and the more esoteric ARMs that are being marketed and have been marketed particularly in the last nine months.  Bankers as a whole I think clearly are doing a good job at underwriting these. We have some lenders on the edges, though, that we’re working on. But these mortgage market developments have some significant macroeconomic implications.  Many of these loans started out with teaser rates that were below current market rates. So first of all, the rates have to catch up to the market level.  Then also, the index to which the rate is tied will have moved up by about 250 or more basis points, say, by the end of the year. So if they are interest-only loans, the rate could go from something that maybe started out with a “1” and could get to something with a “4” in front of it.  And all of a sudden the monthly payments are going to go up fourfold.  Even if defaults don’t increase, it certainly is going to pull August 9, 2005 71 of 110 Another issue is that apparently many of these loans have limits on how much the payment can go up each year in order to try to make the annual adjustment easier.  But that puts borrowers in a predicament because it throws them into negative amortization.  During the teaser period, they’re in negative amortization; and the cap on the index used to reset the monthly payment could put them further into negative amortization. So if they do want to get out of the ARM and switch to a fixed-rate loan, they have to cover the additional negative amortization. Many of these loans have prepayment penalties, so the lenders recoup that.  That may be problematic in moving more people into fixed-rate products as interest rates rise.  And to the extent borrowers go to fixed-rate mortgages, they’ll go to fully amortizing loans, which could be a financial burden—even though we are beginning to see mortgages of 40 years and longer.  The leverage that we see in households on their borrowing I think is another indication that if they’re stretching to be able to afford these houses, it will be more problematic for them to stay in the houses as their monthly payments go up—perhaps even double or triple. So, when we talk about the wealth effect of housing price bubbles, I’m getting concerned around the edges that we could see a major impact on cash flows of both subprime and prime borrowers because these ARMS are indexed to short rates and those rates are moving up.  Since ARMs are a big chunk of the mortgage market today, we have to realize that we can’t just look at long-term mortgage rates and the affordability of housing.  We need to look at the short rates, too, because they’re getting to be more and more important. As I look overall at the economy today—and I’m going to echo some of the comments I’ve heard around the table—I’m very comfortable that we have gotten past the soft spot of the spring. I also am a little pessimistic regarding how this recent bounce will be sustained.  But I August 9, 2005 72 of 110 And in my view, that is a good pace of growth.  I also believe, to echo the comments Governor Kohn just made, that the market has reacted to the understanding that we may have to push rates up even further. There is a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market, and I think that’s what the market is seeing.  When we talk about accommodation, the market is looking at the liquidity that can flow into deals for both commercial activity and for consumers.  So I think we need to continue to push the funds rate upward. And personally, my number for the upper limit on the funds rate is much higher today than it was three to four months ago."
"89";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In assessing all of the information about the District that our Bank staff had gathered for this Open Market Committee meeting, and in my own interactions with contacts around the region, a few words stand out because they were repeated so often. And they are different words than would come to mind from many of the previous discussions. The words are “lackluster,” “underwhelming,” and even “blah.” New England’s growth has been lagging that of the nation through the entire 2001-2005 period, largely because of the impact of the technology downturn in Massachusetts.  For most of 2005, however, it has seemed that the region might be gaining a bit—with employment growing at a pace only slightly behind that of the nation, signs of life in manufacturing, and strong residential real estate markets. We noticed a lull, as almost everybody else did, in the early spring.  We thought that lull would dissipate, but it seems that the forward momentum that existed earlier has faltered a bit.  It could be the recent hot weather and its impact on retail sales.  It could be the impact of high gas August 9, 2005 51 of 110 could be the continuing sense of business caution about hiring and prospective demand.  And it could be the effect of the proposed base closings, especially in Maine.  But whatever it is, economic activity seems to have flattened out, and one can see this in the consumer confidence and business confidence data. Indeed, consumer confidence in New England fell to 79 in July, with readings on current sentiment about normal—a little bit lower, but still in the normal range.  But expectations about future activity were down to their lowest reading since 2001.  Now, it’s only a month’s data, and it’s difficult to get excited about one month’s data on consumer confidence, but I think it does tend to pick up the mood in the region. That’s not to say that the region’s economic health is not moving in a positive direction. Employment is growing; it’s just growing slowly.  Unemployment is down, but that’s largely because the labor force is down. Moreover, manufacturers and related service companies do report growth. Demand is just not as strong as they once expected, and they’ve been working hard to contain costs and increase market share through acquisitions to maintain revenue growth. Indeed, even the once-hot residential real estate market seems to have moderated a bit. Region-wide inventories of homes for sale have risen, and Freddie Mac home price indexes for the region indicate price appreciation about at the national level, except in Rhode Island where the residential real estate boom continues.  Sales of existing homes decreased in the first quarter of 2005 from the previous quarter and levels are below those seen in 2004. Perhaps the lull in economic activity that ushered in the second quarter lingers on in the minds of New England businesses, and maybe the stronger trends that are evident now nationally August 9, 2005 52 of 110 growth is not so much a rising tide that’s lifting all boats but a continual struggle to survive by the businesses within the region. People keep asking where the next new thing is that will fill the downtown office space and get the region really humming again.  There’s no good answer to that question except that the region’s history is replete with cycles of downturn and rebirth and reinvention.  Indeed, looking at the glass as half full, one benefit of a period of slower but positive growth is that a lot of attention is placed on productivity enhancements in the private sector and on creating more incentives for business growth in the public sector. Turning to the nation, our forecast for the rest of ’05 and ’06 is quite similar to that of the Greenbook, using the same monetary policy and government spending assumptions.  We could argue a bit about the Greenbook’s lowered rate of potential growth, and we end up with slightly less inflation and slightly more unemployment, given our sense that the output gap is slightly wider and will not be fully closed by the end of 2006.  But a lot of this is splitting hairs.  Recent economic data, the seemingly stronger health of the labor markets, and the expected flattening out of oil prices are all good news.  The economy is doing well, and inflation seems pretty much in check. And both the Greenbook and we in Boston see that picture continuing into 2006. A key question, of course, in such a halcyon environment, is how one sees the risks to that environment.  Concerns abound about upside inflation risks.  But in my view, anyway, the risks seemed fairly balanced.  As the alternative scenarios point out, the Greenbook might be wrong about the amount of slack in the economy, and the projections of potential might have been shaded lower than is actually the case—that is, should we ever really be able to perceive August 9, 2005 53 of 110 Indeed, one can read a variety of labor market indicators—not just labor force participation, but also long unemployment duration, a low job-finding rate, a low job-separation rate, moderate ECI [Employment Cost Index] wage growth, and overall a continuing subdued pace of employment growth relative to GDP—as suggesting greater levels of labor market slack. Productivity as well could be stronger rather than weaker, as reflected in conversations with every business contact I have; they all continue to emphasize their unflinching focus on cost control and innovation. And profit margins remain quite high by historical standards.  We could well have more room to grow without igniting inflationary pressures and over time need less, rather than more, policy constraint. But the fact remains that we have not yet arrived at a place where most would say policy is neutral, let alone a constraint on activity.  And cost pressures do reflect some upside risk to inflation. Recent data on banks’ consumer, industrial, and construction lending could be a harbinger of more rather than less strength.  Spending on equipment and software could surprise, given anecdotes from the tech sector.  So, growth above potential is possible, and that could nudge resource usage upward. Even now, various measures of wage pressures are sending contrary signals. The better reading may be the ECI data, but the upward trend in unit labor costs should not be ignored. Energy costs could well be a problem, though they are as likely to take a bite out of growth as they are to feed an inflation spiral. The projected current account imbalance of 7 percent of GDP is an even larger concern in my view, as the risk of a significant and perhaps sudden adjustment looms larger.  If the adjustment takes the form of a large depreciation in the dollar and more pass-through to August 9, 2005 54 of 110 And I remain concerned that abnormally low interest rates produce greater risk-taking that could come home to roost in an unpredictable way.  I meet with a group of investment managers prior to the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, mostly to understand better how those individuals are reading markets.  One quote from this week’s meeting: “The biggest risk markets face right now is their belief that there is no risk.”  With equity volatilities at a very low level and bond risk spreads very narrow, market participants seem to believe things are rosy as far as the eye can see, and they seem to be reaching out the risk spectrum for return. And it would seem that consumers continue to reflect the “don’t worry, be happy” perspective in their spending and saving habits. We know from experience that such confidence can be a harbinger of financial instability to come.  Thus, I continue to believe that while the risks to our forecast may be balanced, it would be more costly if we were to err on the side of more rather than less accommodation.  It seems clear to me that the move to a less accommodative posture should continue.  And if current trends persist, that process possibly should accelerate. It also seems clear to me that the move today that the markets expect is the right move to be taking. And I think we should begin to give some thought to how we ought to start the process of changing our statement.  Maybe we don’t need to change it today, but we should set in process some movement toward thinking about how that statement should change.  Continuing to reassure markets with the “measured pace” language may be providing too much in the way of certainty. Arguably, markets don’t need this anymore and would benefit from a more realistic assessment of uncertainty.  Some would argue, I know, that the ideal time to change is either when we see a need to pause or to accelerate.  It’s hard to know when that will be, and I worry August 9, 2005 55 of 110 I think it’s very difficult to react three or four days before a meeting to alternative language and to come up with something that’s satisfactory and moving in the direction of change. If we are going to change our language, I would hope we have a chance, prior to the week before the meeting, to contribute to the underlying thinking that goes into that.  And I would argue that we ought to begin that process sooner rather than later.,  Okay.,  I think that would be a helpful thing to do.  I, by no means, think I have the perfect answer. Probably none of us does."
"90";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I talk to my business contacts in the Fourth District, I’m struck by the lack of any specific concerns about the near-term economic outlook. The business community appears to be optimistic about the remainder of this year— they see diminishing inflation concerns and a brightening growth outlook. The price statistics reported during the intermeeting period were better than I expected them to be.  I hear from businesspeople I talk with that steel and raw material prices remained soft; moreover, the Big Three auto producers have reduced prices to sell more vehicles.  These price cuts might take some pressures off of inflation as well.  Based on the comments of my business contacts and my reading of the details of the price statistics, I don’t see that inflationary pressures are intensifying further. Like President Stern, I don’t believe that the near-term inflation outlook has changed as much as the inflation revisions between the June and August Greenbook might imply.  The inflation environment that I just described seems to be more in line with the baseline forecast in the June Greenbook than that in the August Greenbook.  However, for reasons that David has already explained, the staff believes that there is somewhat more inflation pressure in the economy today than they saw a month ago.  Consequently, they think that the policy path now needs to follow a steeper trajectory than the one assumed last month in order to nudge inflation back down gradually over time. Now, I have to confess that I’d rather be making policy based on the world depicted in the June Greenbook than the world in the August Greenbook.  And I don’t want to come across as complacent about inflation.  As I stated at our last meeting, the inflation rate is already running at the high end of my comfort zone.  I also find myself concerned that the heavily August 9, 2005 57 of 110 the inflation outlook appears to be requiring more policy restraint.  The fed funds path in the August Greenbook might prove to be too steep if inflation pressures unwind faster than the baseline projection contemplates.  But it also might prove to be too flat if those pressures don’t unwind at all. I don’t relish the prospect of having to add an additional 50 basis points to the funds rate path projected in the June Greenbook and not get much of a reduction in the inflation rate as a result of that. Since the funds rate paths in the June and August Greenbooks don’t part company until the November meeting, I’m hopeful that we’ll have a better read on the inflation situation by then. For today I’m comfortable with the path that we’re on, and I don’t see a need to diverge from that path today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"91";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050809meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data, including the benchmark revisions, have altered my perception of the economic scene noticeably.  We now see more underlying strength in economic activity relative to potential through the second quarter and into July. The July employment report suggests that job growth has also gained momentum, and developments in a broad range of financial markets suggest that market participants share this assessment.  The Greenbook, sensibly, has raised its assumed path for the funds rate to bring growth next year back to the pace of potential. The inflation picture is clouded up in both senses of the word.  It is unclear and also a bit foreboding. The picture is a bit foreboding because the benchmark revision boosts inflation as measured by the core PCE to 1.9 percent over the last 12 months, which is at the top of my comfort zone. It’s unclear, because our two main inflation gauges are now giving different readings on the performance of inflation over the last year, although both, fortunately, suggest that inflation has been relatively tame over the past several months.  With a normal gap of about ½ percentage point over the core PCE, the 2.1 percent increase in the core CPI, in contrast, August 9, 2005 38 of 110 Of course, the issue for policy is not so much where inflation was in the past but, rather, where it is headed. Given the unusually small and likely transitory gap between the two measures of core inflation, we tried to break through some of the cloudiness associated with this divergence in signals by examining statistically which measure typically does most of the adjusting to bring the spread back into line.  A finding that the CPI typically does most of the adjusting would be bad news. A finding that the PCE price index normally bears the brunt of the adjustment would be good news.  Unfortunately, we found few statistical regularities.  Both measures have taken the lead at different times, so we can’t count on either one to provide a reasonable signal at the present time. Moving from actual inflation outcomes to the pressures affecting inflation going forward, it seems likely that higher oil prices are being passed through to core inflation to some extent. So unless they rise further, the effect on core inflation should begin to dissipate next year. Unfortunately, I think I also said the same thing at our June meeting, and they did rise again. Another risk relates to unit labor costs, which have risen notably over the past year after several years of little or no change.  This partly reflects slower, although still robust, productivity growth. Insofar as the decline in productivity growth has been cyclical rather than structural, our analysis, and that of other researchers, suggests that it will have little effect on inflation.  In other words, it is structural productivity growth and trend unit labor costs that mainly drive inflation. It would take a drop in structural productivity growth to boost inflation. As discussed in the Greenbook, the recent benchmark revisions probably do warrant a modest decrease in our estimates of structural productivity growth, which does add to inflation August 9, 2005 39 of 110 encouraging that, even after a downward adjustment, productivity still seems to be growing somewhat faster than the robust rates achieved in the second half of the ’90s. I’m less concerned about inflation pressures emanating from the other component of labor costs, namely, labor compensation.  Although compensation per hour jumped recently, this appears to be due to one-time factors and thus should be discounted.  This interpretation is supported by the smaller increase reported in this morning’s release on the second quarter and from readings from the employment cost index, which excludes these items and has shown only modest increases. Furthermore, recent increases in labor compensation could be part of the process by which labor’s share of GPD is returning to more normal levels, following a period of unusually rapid growth in profits that has been pushing up capital’s share. This interpretation is supported by recent econometric work by our staff suggesting that transitory deviations of the markup from its mean are typically unwound over time by movements in labor compensation, not inflation. Indeed, our contacts are telling us that in the absence of much pricing power, increases in labor costs are hurting their bottom lines. The increased pressure on margins appears to have reinvigorated the search for productivity gains.  For example, a natural gas drilling company in our District just installed chips in all of its wells that alert a central control when a well is down. With this technology the firm has been able to shed workers who check the wells manually, and it has decreased the down time of wells in the network. So for all of these reasons, I’m inclined to think that inflationary concerns about unit labor costs should be focused more on possible changes in structural productivity growth than August 9, 2005 40 of 110 Another source of inflationary pressure relates to slack in the labor market.  In my view, a whisker of slack probably still remains, but on balance there is probably less than we saw in June. Of course, the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent in July, but other measures, such as the employment-population ratio, a survey of job market perceptions, and industrial capacity utilization now signal a bit less slack. So, overall, the economy is noticeably stronger than seemed likely in June.  Some of the slack that remained at that time has been eliminated, and the trajectory for inflation has shifted up a bit. The market’s expectations concerning the degree of Fed tightening have increased, as have longer-term yields.  I consider it obvious that we should continue on the path of raising the funds rate, and I’m comfortable with the wording in Alternative B."

"93";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Beyond the tragic and sobering consequences of Katrina that we saw, the effect of Katrina with respect to monetary policy I think has been to create greater uncertainty, not just about the near term but also the intermediate term.  Katrina clearly has become more policy-relevant than the previous natural disasters that we’ve seen, because it hit energy-producing regions of the country at a time of high and potentially rising energy prices driven by global supply and demand factors.  It also came at a September 20, 2005 78 of 117 economy—supported by a particularly strong housing market and accommodative monetary policy—appeared to be growing above potential, Additionally, core measures of inflation, while not deteriorating recently, had been running a bit high for my taste.  Near-term inflation expectations were also rising; and longer- term expectations, while still being described as contained, were somewhat less contained than they had been at the last meeting, as Dino’s chart showed. I think the staff has done an outstanding job of calibrating the effects of Katrina and the subsequent rebuilding on the economy, including a careful assessment of the loss of and need to rebuild the capital stock.  I accept the baseline forecast as the basis for discussion today and note that its contours are similar to those of private sector forecasters as well. However, the range of uncertainty around the baseline forecast is large.  The plunge of consumer sentiment reminds us of that fact, as do the rise in inflation expectations in the most recent survey data and the ongoing jitters in spot and futures energy markets. Faced with such uncertainty, we might be guided by our history in dealing with other periods of shock to the economic system.  During previous episodes of shock and uncertainty, we have often lowered rates or at least temporarily refrained from raising rates to wait for the range of uncertainty to narrow. Therefore, before deciding to raise rates today, we have a burden of examining why we are not following the same reaction function we have in the past. I see at least four reasons why, unlike in the past 20 years or so, the uncertainty that we face now should not be a precursor to a pause.  First, the relative impact of a natural disaster on growth and inflation is ambiguous and not easily comparable to the shocks that we have September 20, 2005 79 of 117 1987, and even Y2K—were clearly, or at least primarily, demand shocks, working through confidence effects and unsettled financial conditions, either actual or potential.  Now, as others have said or implied, we are facing a shock to both the demand and the supply side of the economy.  This is obviously an important distinction.  Katrina is likely to elongate the period of high and rising energy prices that we were already confronting before the hurricane struck. In the longer run, theory tells us that a persistently high energy cost, exacerbated by occasional shocks, reduces both labor productivity and potential output over time, as the amount of energy used per worker declines.  This effect is only partially offset by the installation of energy-saving devices. If households and firms recognize the impact of high energy prices on potential supply, all else equal, they should lower equity prices and also damp aggregate demand through expectational effects. The possible reduction in aggregate demand does not, however, ipso facto match fully the reduction in potential supply.  President Lacker suggested that a naive policymaker might put greater weight on the demand effects, but I also think that a reasonable policymaker would certainly recognize the need to set policy to help maintain a balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand. And that does not inherently imply reducing our target funds rate. Second, as already indicated, before Katrina we were seeing conditions of gradually rising inflation pressures.  Staff estimates that seem reasonable to me indicate that the persistent energy price increases have contributed and will contribute ¼ to ¾ percentage points annually to core inflation between 2004 and 2007.  Importantly, the staff forecast for inflation has been gradually rising from Greenbook to Greenbook as well.  If we were to pause today, in my September 20, 2005 80 of 117 inflation to become embedded in inflation expectations, making it difficult to regain control over the inflation process and losing some of our hard-won credibility. Third, the effort to rebuild parts of the United States will undoubtedly require massive federal expenditures in addition to transfers from insurers to households and businesses.  As the staff forecast shows, this will be highly stimulative to the economy next year.  I won’t elaborate on that, as a number of others have already discussed it. And I think the final reason for not following a pause strategy here, as a few others have said, is that it won’t be clear when we can restart again.  It is not clear to me at all that the data over the next few quarters will be free from the disruption of Katrina, but it is pretty clear to me that inflation pressures will continue to build.  So, therefore, the staff forecast strikes me as a reasonable approach.  That forecast manages to allow these various effects on growth—actual and potential—and inflation to end with a stable inflation outlook, in part by assuming that this Committee raises rates from the current accommodative level.  This assumption seems warranted to me.  In my judgment, we have sufficient reason not to follow our historical response of pausing. The one counterargument to all of this is that there are also clearly a number of drags on the U.S. economy.  These drags include drags from the export sector and relatively slow growth of business fixed investment.  These show through, in my judgment, in the form of a lower equilibrium real interest rate, which implies that at some point we certainly should discuss when we want to stop raising the funds rate or at least be clear that we’ve moved past the neutral level. That may be, as I think Tom Hoenig suggested, in the not-too-distant future.  Be that as it may, September 20, 2005 81 of 117"
"94";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, the Texas economy is faring better than the national economy.  Pre-Katrina we saw very strong evidence of that in all nine of what we call our super sectors in the economy—including, by the way, the information and telecom sectors, which suffered serious setbacks in the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the reversal, coming out of the recession in 2003. Post-Katrina data are likely to be stronger still.  Despite or perhaps because of the unique September 20, 2005 46 of 117 evacuated to the state of Texas.  We expect about 40,000 of them to stay, and that’s above and beyond Jack’s employees to whom we’ve tried very hard to be helpful. The way our economy will improve in the aftermath of the hurricane is by increasing the convention business, for example, that has been displaced into Dallas.  And the port of Houston will have increased activity.  We’ll see what happens with this storm that’s brewing presently. Our office and business relocation efforts are running full bore, and throughout the state we’re getting commitments already from people who have been displaced along the Gulf Coast. Our data show greater business optimism than is seen nationwide.  Our bankers are very frisky. [Laughter] As one of them, the CEO of the largest bank in our District, put it the other day, “loan demand is stronger than horseradish.” And it just continues onward. One concern I would note is that economic conditions in Mexico are worse than we expected, and—a point to make about the Greenbook—we’re less optimistic than the Board staff about the second half of the year. There seems to have been an implosion in domestic demand in Mexico.  We’re also concerned about some developments in the building materials sector for cement, wood, and steel—we’re seeing significant evidence of the hoarding of lumber, for example—and how that might affect construction activity in our state.  We are, at least in Northern Texas, second to Atlanta in terms of housing starts, although fortunately not subject to significant upward price pressures. On the national anecdotal side, this has been an aggressive period for us in that we talked to as many CEOs—many with firms headquartered in our District—and other business contacts as we could. We spoke with a total of 15 CEOs for this round, one COO in retailing—everybody September 20, 2005 47 of 117 sizes and dimensions of conventional companies.  So I’d like to summarize very quickly what we heard. The retailers, from the convenience store operator who is headquartered in our District to the largest retailer, emphasized two points.  First, $3.00 per gallon gasoline seems to be the tipping point in terms of having an impact on consumption.  Whether Katrina is directly related to that or not, the point is that one gets from these retailers evidence of a falling off of demand and, very importantly, a bifurcation of demand.  By the latter I mean that the higher-end retailers like Nieman Marcus continue to do well while the lower- and middle-end retailers suffer. Second, there has been a change in product choice, with a move from branded products to unbranded products. My favorite example provided to me in this call-around was the substitution of Gold Coast cigarettes for Marlboros.  There’s a $2.50 per pack difference, and retailers, particularly 7-Eleven, are seeing significantly higher sales of the lower-priced brand. The price pressures that are coming in retail are in areas one would expect—plastics, packaging, transportation—and there is evidence of price pressures beginning to build.  I understand that Wal-Mart executives have called in the CEOs of all their suppliers and told them that Wal-Mart will not accept further cost through-puts.  But the company indicated that they will work together with their suppliers to achieve efficiencies.  Whether that experiment will succeed or not is another question. On energy, we have what we call a SWOT team—we replace the A with an O, which is for oil—that includes the largest integrated company down to some smaller gas producers.  I’ve been sending around some notes to my co-Presidents on what we have learned from these September 20, 2005 48 of 117 gasoline prices. There are 25 ships at sea presently bringing in product, meaning gasoline.  And the expectation is not so much a direct price movement based on Katrina but increased volatility, as we talked about earlier, dependent on whether or not the winter turns out to be a cold one. That’s what the producers are looking at in terms of the real side of the business as opposed to the speculative side of the business. The effects are working their way through chemicals, and these are effects that don’t come to mind readily.  You can only take a natural gas molecule and divide it in so many ways. Our chemicals people are telling us, for example, that they don’t yet have the leeway to pass through prices on things like nitrogen and hydrogen and other chemicals that we ordinarily don’t think about but that are important to the chemical production process.  But as one said: “We are going to look for every way we can to pass on prices there.” Regarding the shipping and rails, the largest barge company in the country gave us this statistic: 300 to 400 barges out of 15,000 to 16,000 were affected by developments in the Mississippi related to Katrina.  But it was “no big deal except for an impact at the margin.”  We received a similar report from the CEO of one of the larger of the five railroad companies.  One thing that everybody in the transportation business talks about that they applaud politically is the waiving of the Jones Act.  The estimate is that it will cut intercoastal transportation costs by ship by half, which is obviously not insignificant. As far as express delivery is concerned, the key factor there in terms of ground transportation is whether or not the U.S. mail will move up its prices; the expectation is for a 5.4 percent increase in January.  On the auto side, as President Moskow reported, Ford is probably September 20, 2005 49 of 117 the used auto auctions for Manheim and Adessa, the two largest wholesale used car auctioneers. There was a big spike in prices post-Katrina.  If you do the math, whether 100,000 cars or even more were lost from hurricane damage, this should be of assistance to the auto companies. As far as technology is concerned, TI reports the ability to pass on some price increases in their broad semiconductor business.  But again, all the tech folks, whether it’s Dell or EDS, report continued pressure to lower prices and to outsource and new source their employee base. On housing, I have reported on the hoarding of lumber.  There is another interesting development, which is the disappearance of contractors and subcontractors from our state—and apparently from Florida, Jack—because they are rushing to New Orleans to cash in on the money that is going to be spent there. In summary, the comments from our business contacts on Katrina, while acknowledging the human tragedy and the tremendous displacement of people and property, range from “no impact” to “short-term shiver” to “sporadic impact.”  And as cold-hearted as it may seem, this comes down to the issue of where we are today.  The way I have thought about it is that I believe there will be less of an income statement impact but more of a balance sheet impact, which is something I worry about.  What I mean by that is that perhaps we will see a temporary setback in terms of growth, a shifting in the complexion of that growth, and, to be sure, additional volatility and potential price increases. But what I worry about most, Mr. Chairman, is what I have come to refer to as the fiscal incontinence of the government.  That is, I worry about money being thrown at a problem and whether or not that will undermine the confidence that we depend on to September 20, 2005 50 of 117 I’m reminded of a story that George Shultz told me about his time working under President Reagan, who was very frustrated about spending.  George picked up the phone and called I think it was Sam Cohen and said, “Tell me, Sam, is there really any difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to spending?”  And Cohen said, “I want to think about it, do some research, and give you a serious answer.”  He called back the next morning and said, “Yes, George, there is. Democrats enjoy it more.” [Laughter]  “But otherwise there doesn’t appear to be any difference.” I want to vote for a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate.  I agree with President Santomero’s point about confidence.  I worry about the price pressures that are building, but I also think it’s very, very important that regardless of the amount of additional fiscal stimulus— whether it’s $85 billion or more—that we not be viewed as being tempted in any way, shape, or form, to monetize that fiscal spending, whether it’s incontinence or profligacy. I would suggest also, Mr. Chairman—and this may seem odd—the possibility of looking at the language in our statement, which I think Jack mentioned obliquely, and whether or not we want to continue with the term “measured pace.”  Has it run its course?  Has it become synonymous with a 25 basis point increase or not?  And might we not use Katrina as an opportunity to decouple that link in order to provide us greater flexibility going forward?  But, in summary, I am in favor of continuing to remove policy accommodation.  Thank you very much."
"95";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Obviously, our Atlanta Bank’s attention these past three weeks has been riveted on Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, because of both our operational responsibilities in the areas affected by the storm and our concerns about the welfare of our New Orleans staff.  In addition, we have been trying to contribute to our collective understanding of the policy implications of the storm and its aftermath. Let me first take this opportunity to thank our colleagues here in Washington and at all of the Reserve Banks for the extraordinary support you have given us over the past three weeks and for the contributions some of you and many of your staff members have sent for our New Orleans staff relief fund to help some of our most desperate employees.  Also, it’s my September 20, 2005 37 of 117 us with the processing of New Orleans checks in Atlanta.  And our sister banks in Dallas and St. Louis and the Cash Product Office in San Francisco have gone to extraordinary lengths to help us meet the cash needs of the hurricane-affected areas. Fortunately, we have accounted for all but one of our 176 New Orleans staff.  Our staff members now, amazingly, are spread across 12 states, living with friends and relatives and trying to restart their lives. It’s not clear at this point when we’ll be able to restart operations out of the New Orleans office. We have sorted through the various dimensions of the impact of the storm and could cite much in the form of detailed statistics and anecdotal evidence.  That descriptive information has already been shared with the Board staff and others around the System, so let me use my time to focus on our views of the most important policy implications of what has happened. In the end, we believe—if past experience is any guide—that while there will be a hit to output, the natural inclination of people to rebuild residences and businesses will begin to kick in more quickly than one might expect.  And this will be supported by the inflow of insurance payments and the substantial federal aid that the President has promised, as we have already talked about. We do believe that this will begin sooner in Mississippi, which does not have to contend with the flooding that will delay progress in New Orleans.  In fact, our directors from Mississippi indicate that as early as last week deals were being done and aggressive cleanup and even some major repair work had already started.  From this perspective then, we believe the lost output, as is the case in the forecast in the Greenbook, will be made up reasonably quickly. My greater concern is on the implications for prices from the damage of the area’s September 20, 2005 38 of 117 refineries, pipelines, and natural gas processing facilities.  These facilities are critical to the production and distribution of energy and energy-related products for the nation as a whole.  The damage has already been seen, as oil and natural gas prices have spiked, and we believe there will be important impacts on both headline and core inflation measures.  These will result from the ripple effects stemming mainly from the supply shock to the prices of oil and gas, refined products, transportation, and building materials. In addition, the promised federal spending will help to fuel demand for labor in the area and for construction materials as well as other goods and services that are already in short supply and will be needed for the rebuilding.  As someone else has already indicated, this increased demand will clearly add to short-term price pressures that will extend beyond the South.  How significant and how long-lasting these price effects will be is still very uncertain. For example, we don’t know how long the supply problem, particularly for natural gas, will last. Despite what has been reported elsewhere, our on-the-ground sources state that a large part of the pipeline system that moves oil and gas from the wells to processing facilities has yet to be inspected for damage, so we just can’t yet know how long it will be until normal operations resume.  And as Karen noted, this uncertainty may be exacerbated by Hurricane Rita, which is now on a projected path that would take it through some of the offshore gas and oil fields that were not severely hit by Katrina. Our own sense is that the implications of the natural gas disruption and its associated price run-up have not been given sufficient attention.  While natural gas reserves are reported to have been in the normal seasonal range prior to Katrina, there is little September 20, 2005 39 of 117 The chairman of my board of directors, who heads the holding company of the major electric power company serving the Southeast, told me just yesterday that if natural gas prices remain as high as futures markets suggest, the consumer is in for a huge hit in coming months. He suggests that not only will homeowners be shocked at their bills for natural gas this winter, particularly if we have a cold winter, but that electric utility rates are in for a big jump, as state regulatory agencies eventually approve the pass-through increase in generation costs attributed to high natural gas prices. We know that virtually all of the new electric-generating facilities built in the last couple of decades were designed with natural gas as the preferred fuel.  Just as higher gasoline prices seem to have finally hit home with consumers, these coming jolts from natural gas and electric bills could well show through to inflation expectations, in our view. While some of these supply and price shocks will likely be transitory, and energy supply problems should ease a bit as pumping capacity in refineries comes back on line, they will still last for several months before reverting to levels that we think are likely to be a bit higher than pre-Katrina levels. These increased energy prices will show through markedly, most markedly in the broad headline inflation measures.  But we also think we will see some significant feed- through effects to core prices. Large industrial users of natural gas, like the building materials company Georgia-Pacific, whose president is on our Atlanta board, are already feeling the huge cost pressures from high natural gas prices and have become more determined than ever to pass on some of those costs. Another of our directors with worldwide responsibility for Dow Chemical indicates that prices for petrochemical feeder stock from oil and gas are already up 20 to 40 percent and will September 20, 2005 40 of 117 who runs a major trucking firm indicates that her costs are going through the roof, and fuel surcharges are now the norm.  The anecdotal information is that customers are more readily accepting these increased costs, which are now being passed on more readily rather than being limited by competitive pressures.  For these reasons, we are not nearly as sanguine about either the short-term or long-term implications for prices as the Greenbook. Putting all of this together, we believe, as the Greenbook clearly lays out, that the economy went into Katrina with considerable momentum.  And looking past the next six months or so, we think the hit to near-term aggregate growth will be more than offset by the stimulus associated with deployment of private and public funds to rebuild. The maturity of the expansion pre-Katrina was underscored by a report from one of our regular temporary employment agency contacts who reported that they are now seeing shortages in several markets in a number of skilled and unskilled jobs.  In fact, they have raised wages by $2.50 an hour in several categories. While I think one might make the case today for a pause from our policy path, it is the case that significant monetary accommodation is already in place. And we have more fiscal policy support to come in targeted federal spending for hurricane relief. I am most concerned about the pressure on prices.  While some of this will be short-lived, I don’t think those higher inflation numbers will go unnoticed by either businesses or individuals. And I think this could begin to cause some deterioration in inflation expectations, which remained reasonably well contained until recently.  At the same time, I don’t want us to appear to be overreacting to the short-term supply shock to prices; that may make it seem that we think we’ve gotten behind the curve. I believe the best way to ensure that expectations don’t September 20, 2005 41 of 117 as hard as it is for me, coming from our area, to say—that we should increase our fed funds target rate by another 25 basis points today and be very careful about the communication that we craft to go with that announcement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"96";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been a lot of discussion on the national economy and Katrina, and I don’t think I’ll repeat that.  But I would say that I am in agreement with the scenario the Greenbook has outlined here; we do expect a temporary slowdown in the economy this year and then a pickup next year and beyond.  And I think the September 20, 2005 66 of 117 Economic growth in the District remains strong, although businesses have expressed some concern over the impact of Katrina on the regional economy.  At the end of August, though, employment was still growing solidly.  Retailers reported further growth in sales; tourist activity continued to show little effect from higher gasoline prices at that time; and manufacturing activity had grown pretty solidly over the summer. In a special survey that we conducted following Katrina, a wide range of contacts said that the disaster would have some negative effect on their businesses in terms of costs and the availability of supplies.  And a small percentage actually expected some positive effects from it. More specifically, a contact at a major railroad coming out of our District from Kansas City told me that they were able to get their operations along the Gulf Coast back in order within just a few days of Katrina and were back moving materials across that area at almost normal levels. So, there has been a fairly strong reaction in terms of bringing things back on line after Katrina. While the impacts of Katrina remain uncertain, I would say that analysts in the farm sector are more optimistic than they were just a week ago, for example.  The impact on the transportation system, as I just mentioned, appears to be less than initially feared.  Terminal facilities are now reporting limited damage to physical infrastructure, and the unloading of barges and loading of ocean-going vessels appear to be starting again.  As a result, the hurricane’s impact on agriculture will be primarily through higher fuel prices.  Higher diesel and natural gas prices have a large impact on crop production costs, as they boost the cost of operating machinery, drying grain, fertilizers, and so forth.  So overall I think activity in our District will continue strong. Katrina will have some impact on the region but not a major or September 20, 2005 67 of 117 Turning to the inflation outlook, my concerns there have not changed since our last meeting.  Core inflation is higher than I would prefer, although it still is in the 2 percent plus range. Core CPI inflation, for example, is up 2.2 percent in August from a year ago, and other measures of underlying CPI inflation are, in fact, higher and moving slowly up.  In addition, I believe the upside risks to inflation have increased, and I think we need to be aware of that and sensitive to it. In my view, a pause now would in fact be more than a pause, because as others said—in particular President Santomero—in this environment the data are going to come in weaker than we would otherwise expect.  So a pause now would be hard to reverse until sometime next year. The other point, which others also have noted, is that fundamentally monetary policy remains accommodative for now.  We have been removing accommodation but policy is still accommodative, and I think we need to keep that in mind.  Therefore, I think we should continue on that path as we move forward from this point.  I would agree, though, since we have been removing accommodation for a while, that at some point here in the next few meetings we should be talking about changing the language and about how close we are to neutral on the funds rate. I think that will be an important and interesting discussion for us.  However, for the time being, I think we should stay on our course and remove accommodation at the pace we have been doing in recent months.  Thank you."
"97";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like President Geithner and many others of you, I do view this as one of those rare situations in which we can truly say the outlook is more uncertain than usual.  [Laughter] But that should not deter us from proceeding with our “measured pace” of rate increases. The pre-Katrina data themselves suggested some potentially interesting questions about the outlook, which could have implications for policy going forward.  I was especially struck by the weakness in capital spending, despite high and rising profits and strength in other aspects of the so-called fundamentals.  It’s possible that business caution has increased again, perhaps out of concern about the effects of the rapid run-up in energy prices on demand since last spring. But at the same time, house prices on the OFHEO index continued to rise at a very rapid pace through the second quarter, supporting household spending and further increases in resource utilization. The expansion was continuing but had become even more unbalanced—more reliant on declining household saving rates induced by rising house prices.  Core inflation was coming in lower than expected again. But the potential for future price increases, absent a further tightening of policy, was suggested by upside surprises on one measure of labor costs, rising resource utilization, and the threat that increases in energy costs could feed through to underlying September 20, 2005 76 of 117 I agree with the staff’s assessment that the most likely outcome from Katrina is that the economy will not be materially deflected from the path it was on.  After the initial disruptions, fiscal stimulus, rising house prices, and still favorable financial conditions, along with the economy’s natural resilience, should overcome any drag from higher energy prices and should keep activity increasing at a good clip in an economy that is already producing at a high level of resource utilization. Under these circumstances, inflation pressures will not abate.  And judging from the tendency for the output gap to continue to shrink this year, we’ll probably need at least a couple of rounds of rate increases to keep the economy near its potential and to prevent inflation from trending higher. Katrina has greatly added to uncertainty, and not just about the extent of the near-term disruption or the effects on energy markets.  The more difficult uncertainties relate to how people may react to what has happened, how the government will decide to respond, and how businesses and households will react to these governmental actions and to whatever the path of energy prices turns out to be. How these uncertainties are resolved will affect the economy’s medium-term prospects. But at this point, that added uncertainty doesn’t look particularly asymmetrical in its implications for the path of policy. The risks are still two-sided.  Growth could be stronger than anticipated, for example, owing to greater government spending and new tax incentives, with implications for inflation. But on the other side, the rise in energy prices may have less of a persistent effect on core inflation than the staff has predicted. The feed-through of energy prices to core inflation has declined appreciably over time, September 20, 2005 77 of 117 August may have it right that higher energy prices will have more of a negative influence on demand than a positive effect on long-term inflation.  The skews in the probabilities for the most likely outcomes were highlighted by the Michigan survey on Friday, pointing to extra weight on the possibility of weaker growth from increasing energy prices that affect consumer psychology and spending but also pointing to potentially higher inflation if expectations do become unanchored. And these skews themselves have offsetting implications for policy. Moreover, uncertainty isn’t going to be reduced by pausing or slowing the pace of tightening. This uncertainty isn’t about the response of the economy to past or future monetary policy actions. Raising the funds rate, as expected, isn’t likely to undermine sentiment or spending. Indeed, pausing, slowing down, or being more ambiguous about our expectations for policy going forward could confuse the public about our view of the situation. In sum, this is a situation in which we should make our best guesses as to the likely outcome, however bad those guesses may be, and act on them, continuing the “measured pace” of tightening for now. Thank you."
"98";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic activity appears to have expanded at a quicker pace from mid-August through mid-September.  For the most part, production and sales in our area were not substantially affected by Hurricane Katrina.  Shipments from District factories accelerated from August’s modest upturn, and new orders grew for the first time since May.  Service firms reported faster growth in their revenues, and they maintained the moderate pace of hiring seen in early August.  Retailers told us that overall sales grew modestly. Labor market conditions remained solid, with District job growth maintaining the moderate pace of recent months. Hurricane Katrina had relatively few real effects in our area, as I said, causing only some scattered and short-lived outages of gasoline and interrupting raw materials shipments to a small number of manufacturing firms.  In addition, higher gasoline prices, combined with fears of September 20, 2005 61 of 117 Ophelia, battered the Carolina coast last week, but preliminary assessments suggest it was not any more damaging than the typical, run-of-the-mill hurricane. While several of our contacts tell us that higher fuel costs will squeeze profit margins, the majority tell us that they are passing on cost increases to their customers.  Many firms report that customers are more receptive to price hikes in the current environment.  With about half the responses in as of yesterday morning, preliminary results from our September business surveys are showing that both prices paid and prices received are rising at a quicker pace than in August, and expected price trends have generally ratcheted up as well. Turning to the national picture, the Greenbook’s forecasts for output and its components appear broadly consistent with private forecasters and with what we were hearing from our Fifth District contacts. Prior to Katrina, the economy was growing at a reasonably strong pace but with some signs of inflation pressures rising from elevated oil prices.  And the real effects of the hurricane that are projected in the Greenbook forecast appear quite plausible, given the difficulties of assessing the temporal extent of the disruptions to economic activity. But on the inflation side, the Greenbook forecast paints a picture that I find somewhat distressing. The staff’s inflation forecast has been steadily drifting up over time—as shown, for example, in the fine new table on page 21.  [Laughter]  And it was revised up markedly for this meeting.  Core PCE inflation is near 2½ percent throughout 2006 and does not fall below 2 percent until 2007. Inflation expectations move upward as well, which causes growth in compensation and unit labor costs to step up significantly at the beginning of next year.  This September 20, 2005 62 of 117 While the real, quantitative effects of the hurricane are uncertain at this time and may prove more moderate than first feared, the qualitative implications for short-term real rates seem quite clear to me.  A real interest rate is, of course, the price of current resources relative to forgone future resources, and for a number of reasons Katrina has caused a temporary scarcity of current resources. A portion of the capital stock in the affected region has been destroyed or damaged, and workers have been separated from employers.  It will inevitably take time and resources to rebuild the capital stock and reestablish productive labor market matches. The good news is that these effects are likely to be relatively short-lived.  Within a year or so, we are likely to be back to more or less where we would have been in the aggregate.  But this means that, if anything, Katrina should cause real interest rates to rise to encourage adjustment to the temporary scarcity of current resources.  The fiscal response to the disaster points in the same direction regarding real rates.  The sustainability of federal deficits was questionable prior to Hurricane Katrina, and the spending amounts being proposed for hurricane recovery efforts just strengthen the case for tighter policy. I think we have to be careful about reasoning on the basis of the gap between current output and estimates of potential output.  Some estimates appear to identify the decline in potential primarily with a small estimated effect of lost capital.  Such approaches see the supply- side effects of Katrina as minimal and, therefore, interpret most of the decline in output as a shock to aggregate demand. This makes it tempting to a naive policymaker to consider counteracting the September 20, 2005 63 of 117 which I’m aware amount to reductions in our current capacity to produce goods and services. Lower real interest rates can do little to counteract these reductions. I think we should be careful about the widely cited analogy in the public press to the 1970s when oil supply shocks were subsequently followed by recessions.  I say this recognizing that several participants around the table were somewhat closer to monetary policy than I was then. But in the 1970s, inflation expectations were untethered, and people came to expect us to allow energy price shocks to feed through to overall inflation.  We often confirmed that expectation by keeping real interest rates from rising.  In fact, at times, we kept nominal rates from rising as fast as inflation and, thus, real rates fell.  We were then forced to raise rates dramatically to bring inflation back down and, in the process, exacerbated the real effects of the oil price shocks. So, to interpret the effects of Katrina as signaling an imminent shortfall of aggregate demand is to draw the wrong lesson from the 1970s, in my view.  The right lesson for us today is the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored in the face of this shock.  At our last meeting, we noted the relative stability of longer-term inflation expectations as measured by the TIPS inflation compensation numbers, even in the face of sustained oil price increases.  But the behavior of the fed funds futures prices and the TIPS curve since Hurricane Katrina suggest to me that our credibility is seriously incomplete, in the sense that many market participants appear to think that we might be willing to tolerate elevated inflation for some time in an attempt to ease the real effects of the hurricane.  Our action and statement today should provide the public with greater certainty about our near-term intentions.  Thank you. September 20, 2005 64 of 117"
"99";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, the fundamentals in the Seventh District continue to improve, although we are still underperforming the national economy.  Prior to Katrina, most of our contacts thought that their businesses were expanding at rates consistent with the long-run trends in their industries. One exception was the motor vehicle sector.  The size of the drop in sales in August was a disappointment to automakers, but not a surprise.  They also complained about the effect of gasoline prices on demand, particularly the shift in sales away from big SUVs toward more fuel-efficient but less profitable models. When we asked our contacts about the impact of Hurricane Katrina, they reported several different kinds of effects. Some noted increased activity in response to the storm.  A number of firms in our District received orders for items such as RVs, construction materials, heavy equipment, and appliances.  And Ford said that they were looking at increasing their fourth- quarter production schedules to replace vehicles destroyed by the hurricane.  But we also heard September 20, 2005 35 of 117 contacts noted some decline in activity, which they attributed to higher energy prices, uncertainty, and a CNN effect. High- and low-end stores were reported to be doing okay, but specialty retailers were taking a hit. Katrina also has led to some cost increases in our District.  Grain elevators are paying more to work through transportation disruptions and to dry crops in storage.  We also heard concerns that the diversion of resources to the Gulf Coast will drive up the cost of construction materials and skilled tradesmen throughout the country.  And several contacts noted increases in costs for fuels, fertilizer, and shipping. Of course, not all of the cost increases we have been hearing about are related to Katrina.  Indeed, a major retailer and one of our temporary help contacts commented that wage pressures had increased notably at the national level. Turning to the national outlook, the data we had in hand prior to Hurricane Katrina pointed to a solid expansion in activity.  We all know how devastating Katrina was in terms of the misery it caused the people of the Gulf Coast.  Nonetheless, although the uncertainty is great, the hurricane’s effects on the national economy likely will be short-lived.  Even in the near term, the Greenbook baseline projection doesn’t have Katrina reducing GDP growth below trend; and certainly by early next year the hurricane should have a net positive effect for growth, given the large federal spending coming on line. With regard to inflation, the July and August readings on core prices were good, but even so the Greenbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year has been raised to 2¼ percent.  Last time many of us were concerned that core inflation was running at the upper end of the range September 20, 2005 36 of 117 Greenbook, and as we were talking about earlier, one major reason for this increase in the inflation forecast is the expected pass-through of higher energy and distribution costs. Another important risk is faster compensation growth.  Both compensation per hour and the ECI are projected to increase significantly next year, and this seems consistent with the anecdotes I noted earlier about wage pressures.  These pressures are of particular concern at this stage of the cycle because we can’t expect continued outsized gains in productivity to hold down unit labor costs. Some cost increases may be absorbed by lower profit margins, but there is a risk that they may show up in higher prices as well. With the outlook for inflation already higher, and with so much liquidity in the financial system, the cost of excessive policy accommodation could be significant.  So at this point, we should continue to increase rates until they are safely in the neutral zone."
"100";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Dave Stockton’s introduction today suggested that this Greenbook analysis was a combination of the use of judgment and models.  And as I reviewed the input, I noted it reflects that combination. To wit, the Greenbook said that Katrina will restrain economic activity for the remainder of the year. Information is scant and fractured. We are in uncharted territory, with devastation of an entire city. Katrina is expected to depress real GDP by about ¾ percentage point in the third quarter, half of the effect due to reduced energy sector output.  In the fourth quarter, a small positive real GDP growth is expected, but consumption will remain depressed.  By the end of 2007, the level of GDP is expected to be back where it would have been prior to the hurricane. Not included in the Greenbook, but a judgment that seems obvious at this point, is that there is an immeasurable but hard to ignore fact that the economy is only now recovering from a corporate wariness toward expansion, suggesting that the psychological impact of Katrina is potentially problematic. Turning to the inflation outlook, consumer energy prices are expected to increase considerably in the third and fourth quarters and then fall back in subsequent years.  Our current projection for the pass-through effect contributes 0.2 to core PCE prices in 2006, with little effect in 2007. The fiscal stimulus expected to follow Katrina will impact the economy primarily in the years 2006 and 2007. I would say that, as time passes, hopefully the need for an appropriate congressional response to Katrina will be balanced by the need for fiscal discipline, as suggested September 20, 2005 82 of 117 With respect to the monetary policy path, the September Greenbook was unchanged from the August Greenbook; the expectation is for a 4 percent fed funds target by year-end and a 4¼ percent rate by mid-2006.  In one of the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook—characterized by deteriorating inflation expectations created largely by surging energy costs—core PCE will not stabilize at 2 percent by 2007 but instead rise to 2½ percent in that year.  A Taylor rule construct of monetary policy response would bring the fed funds target at that point to 4¾ percent. In summary, the economy has taken a body blow as a result of Katrina.  The solid growth that we had been experiencing has been interrupted, but the economy is expected to get back on track during 2006. The speed of the recovery is unknowable at this point, as the devastation to New Orleans has put us in uncharted territory, as we said earlier.  It is important, as many of you have pointed out, to note that the pass-through effects of higher energy costs require that we maintain and perhaps increase our sensitivity to inflationary pressures.  The effects of Katrina and the concerns about the potential for Hurricane Rita, as amplified by yesterday’s movement in the WTI spot price, suggest that we not take this week’s measure of inflationary expectations or headline inflation as an indication of how core inflation may be impacted in future months. Ten consecutive ¼ point increases have brought the target fed funds rate into a range where it can reach both the expected level for year-end as well as that for the middle of next year without a need to continue our unbroken pace of rate increases.  And a pause would accommodate the alternative scenario of deteriorating inflationary expectations.  As it will be September 20, 2005 83 of 117 caused by Katrina, I think it may be appropriate to pause or defer removing accommodation at this meeting."
"101";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus on a couple of anecdotal reports on the weak side of the projections going forward.  But I don’t want this to be September 20, 2005 68 of 117 I do want to say also that we seem to have merged the first and second go-rounds, so I’ll just take note of that. [Laughter] I’m not going to break that pattern either. According to my contact at Wal-Mart, the company estimates that every $10 per barrel increase in crude oil costs them about 100 basis points of same-store growth.  In fact, Wal-Mart is cutting back purchases for the holiday season.  Wal-Mart suppliers are also concerned about the strength of holiday sales, and Wal-Mart is in the process of negotiating price concessions in anticipation of weak sales.  I think that more or less fits the message from my colleague to the right. Wal-Mart is anticipating a significant effect on corporate profits from the hurricane, both because of the damage and also because of the voluntary contributions that many companies have made. I have a contact in a large software company who said that they are very concerned about weakness in the large enterprise sector of that business on a global basis.  They don’t understand exactly what’s happening there, but they believe large enterprises may be making a genuine effort by to cut back on spending, perhaps because of the cycle that companies went through. They had delayed purchases and a lot of them have come back.  But now they have filled their needs and are slowing down. My UPS contact said that they’re looking at an unexplained shortfall in the last two months in volume and revenue projections coming out of Asia.  They don’t know why that is happening. One other thing that’s going on with UPS and FedEx both is that they’re in the midst of labor negotiations that are beginning to become nasty, with pilots disrupting service.  An example cited was this: A pilot lands a plane, knows that something needs to be fixed, but September 20, 2005 69 of 117 a delay. So there are some so-called job actions by some very strong-willed pilots.  I think this is true for both UPS and FedEx, and it could lead to some disruption during the peak season. As I hear people around the table—and I think we’ll hear the same from those who have not yet spoken—we’re all very adamant that the fundamental course of policy going forward not depart from controlling inflation.  So, looking out over the next year, Katrina will have an effect primarily through the energy sector, because the direct disruption is a pretty small part of the total economy. What we have is a supply disturbance in energy overlaid on a fundamentally strong demand picture that has been driving up energy prices worldwide, and I don’t think we know exactly how big that disruption is going to be from the supply side.  And it’s not just gasoline; I think heating costs for fuel oil and natural gas will be a bigger bind for consumers.  Once we start paying winter heating bills, the discussions about sales being hurt by high gasoline prices are going to be displaced substantially by discussions about the cost of heating. I would like to state my own view in favor of a pause.  At least I think we ought to get that case on the table. I want to reemphasize that we need to retain our longer-run concern about inflation. I think we can be completely clear about that in our statement.  The statement would say something along the lines that as the uncertainties are resolved, we would then anticipate resuming the “measured pace” of rate increases. But I would also like to address the policy question by focusing on how best to deal with a number of possible outcomes.  To some extent we tend to focus on the forecast in terms of a point estimate, and I think the Greenbook does a good job with that.  But there are substantial September 20, 2005 70 of 117 looking out a year because it’s a question of how fast the reconstruction takes place.  Huge federal involvement may actually slow things down in the near term, because people will be waiting to see the money and may delay spending to rebuild and replace.  I don’t really know. But I’d like to focus attention on the following:  Suppose, on the one hand, we have a good news scenario where things fall into place better than we might have anticipated and, on the other hand, a bad news scenario where things are worse than we might have anticipated.  How would today’s policy decision position us best for dealing with those various possibilities? Clearly, if we raised rates today, it would fit nicely with the good news scenario.  And we would continue removing policy accommodation with however many more moves are needed in the future. If we have a bad news scenario and we paused today, that also would fit well.  On the other hand, if we raised the funds rate today and have a bad news scenario, we might find ourselves in a position where we would feel compelled to pause later.  Then we would be in a situation where people would question why we didn’t pause right after the hurricane when all the uncertainties were in place.  If we paused now, we would have made the correct call, if you will. And as the uncertainties are resolved, we would then go back to raising rates.  So, it’s that kind of calculation that leads me to come out in favor of a pause.  I think with the proper wording of our statement we will be able to resume our rate increases in a timely fashion.  Thank you."
"102";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Consumer spending for general merchandise has edged up. Retailers report that back-to-school shopping got off to a slow start in August, but attributed it to exceptionally warm weather, which hindered the sale of fall merchandise.  Auto sales have been brisk, with dealers in the region reporting continuing high rates of sales in August, except for large SUVs. Employment is rising steadily in the region, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation.  While the regional unemployment rate ticked up in July from its second-quarter level, it remains lower than the national rate. Housing markets remained strong in the District, with sales continuing at a high rate. Price appreciation continues at a steady pace, but several of our contacts noted that higher-priced homes appear to be taking longer to sell now than earlier this year.  The nonresidential market continues to improve, with construction contracts up and office leasing active.  The demand for commercial space continues to expand at a slow but steady pace in Philadelphia.  Although vacancy rates remain high, we have seen positive net absorption of office space for seven consecutive quarters. Rental rates remain steady. Recent manufacturing activity in the District has been softer than we saw earlier this year. The index of general activity in the manufacturing survey rebounded in August but fell September 20, 2005 42 of 117 District this month. The downward trend in our index since the beginning of the year is echoed by a number of the regional manufacturing indexes as well as the national purchasing managers’ index. There was also a significant drop in the respondents’ expectations about future activity. There were still more firms expecting an increase in activity over the next six months than expecting a decline, but the percentage of respondents expecting a decline doubled in September. I should point out, however, that the survey was taken in the days early after the Katrina event, and that likely had something to do with the large drop.  We’ll have to look forward to the next couple of months. Perhaps the most notable and troubling information from our latest survey is the significant increase in price indexes.  The prices paid index showed its strongest increase since 1973 and is at its highest level since January.  The index for prices received also moved higher. Expectations about future prices were also considerably higher this month. Concerns about inflation are not limited to our manufacturers.  While the economic impact of the hurricane has been slight in our District—and our business contacts expect further improvement in our regional economy—the loss of petroleum products and production in the facilities in the Gulf of Mexico has prompted a sharp rise in inflation concerns in many of our firms. Turning to the national outlook, as the Greenbook noted, incoming data on the national economy pre-Katrina indicated that the expansion was continuing on a solid footing, with GDP growth slightly higher than potential. Labor markets continued to improve, with little or no slack September 20, 2005 43 of 117 prices. While there was some softening in the most recent orders and shipments data, this reflected the usual month-to-month volatility, and business spending remained healthy. Higher energy prices were showing through to headline inflation, but so far had little impact on core inflation.  If Katrina hadn’t happened, it is my view that a decision to continue our strategy to remove monetary policy accommodation would have been relatively easy.  But Katrina did happen. The hurricane is a human tragedy, as was noted, and it has changed the near-term outlook for the economy. I commend the Greenbook staff for the careful discussion and analysis of the potential effects on both growth and inflation. I acknowledge that there is a wider band of uncertainty around the forecasts than there had been.  However, as a baseline forecast, I think the Greenbook has it largely right.  Certainly, Katrina will have a substantial impact on the Gulf of Mexico’s regional economy for many months to come.  It also has a potentially wider national scope than other natural disasters.  Because of the disruption in the energy and shipping sectors, it will have ramifications for the rest of the economy. The destruction of the physical wealth and oil infrastructure and the disruption in economic activity will temporarily reduce the growth of the national economy and add to inflation over the near term. Monthly data over the next couple of months are going to be weaker than we’d like to see, and our headline inflation numbers are going to be higher than we would like. But these effects are likely temporary.  The cleanup has already begun, as was noted, and rebuilding efforts funded by public and private spending will add to baseline growth September 20, 2005 44 of 117 As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and the energy markets stabilize, much of the run- up of inflation should reverse as well. Of course, a longer-run negative impact is not out of the realm of possibility, but I think we will see a reversal of the sharp run-up in oil and gasoline prices after the hurricane season. That, along with the good economic prospects, the good progress going forward to get the oil and refinery capacity back on line, and the improvement in governmental response after a troublesome beginning will all help mitigate these longer-run impacts. The relevant policy options for us to consider at this point are whether to continue removing policy accommodation or to take a pause.  I would argue that the prudent course of action today is to remain on our previous path, i.e., to continue to move rates up gradually. There are ample fundamental reasons for such a policy action.  “We are at a whisker from potential output,” to quote a recent comment by President Yellen.  I like that comment—“a whisker.” [Laughter] And I continue to be concerned about inflationary pressures.  The higher energy prices we saw even before Katrina add to the concern. And we now have a significant increase in the amount of fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, as was discussed, which has the potential to keep pressure on inflation elevated for some time, even after energy price increases subside.  I would also note the apparent increase in near-term inflation expectations.  The recently released University of Michigan Survey, discussed earlier and in our briefing documents, shows a fairly hefty increase in both short- and medium-term expectations of inflation—a fact worthy of our September 20, 2005 45 of 117 Finally, I believe that continuing to reduce policy accommodation would be the best way to underscore to both the markets and the public our belief that Katrina will not change the underlying economic fundamentals and that the negative impact on growth will be temporary. Markets generally expect a rate increase today, so I believe that move would not be disruptive. By contrast, pausing today will do little to improve the temporary effects on growth of Katrina, which is largely a supply shock. And if we do pause today on the grounds that Katrina has made the short-run economic outlook uncertain, I think it will be very difficult for us to resume raising rates in the short term.  Economic data coming in over the next couple of months on production, employment, and consumer spending are likely to be weak because of hurricane effects. Trying to craft a statement to explain why we are raising rates in the midst of weak data, after pausing now, would be a daunting task.  So if we pause today, I think we have to consider that we will be on hold for a while, perhaps even as long as to the beginning of next year.  In my mind, this poses an unacceptable risk that we will find ourselves behind the curve.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"103";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with a few pertinent facts about the District economy, both pre- and post-Katrina.  Overall, the District economy remains healthy. Employment is continuing to advance modestly; and in at least a few geographic areas, it seems likely that employment gains are being constrained by a lack of available labor.  Construction activity, both residential and nonresidential, is strong and/or improving.  And one of the large credit card issuers in our District has reported—and I think this is reflective of national conditions—that repayments on credit card debt are up and charge-offs are at a 10-year low. Higher fuel prices so far have not led to production cutbacks or plant closings in the District. Where possible, firms are switching to less expensive sources of energy, and surcharges are, of course, common. Higher energy prices do, though, seem to be particularly adverse for local governments and for farmers, who are also adversely affected by the infrastructure destruction and disruption in the Gulf area. As for the effects of Katrina on the national economy, at the qualitative level I think we actually have considerable experience in analyzing these kinds of shocks, and in my view the Greenbook at that level has it essentially right.  It seems to me, as others have commented, that in the short term we will get a disruption to growth followed by a rebound and presumably ultimately a resumption of trend growth.  And, as far as inflation is concerned, I think we will get an acceleration ultimately followed by a return to trend, assuming that policy adheres more or less to the path that it would have followed. At the quantitative level, though, it seems to me difficult to say anything precise with a lot of confidence. But I would venture that in these circumstances—because of the concentration September 20, 2005 65 of 117 relative to the energy and transportation infrastructure—the amplitude of the swings, both in terms of growth and inflation, and perhaps the duration of the adjustment, would be extended. There’s a temptation, I suppose, to exaggerate this.  After all, a relatively small part of the economy is affected.  But it seems to me that, in any event, uncertainty has increased.  And if this overall description is roughly appropriate, then I find thinking about monetary policy more complicated than it was formerly.  Moreover, I don’t think the situation is going to get clarified in the near term, because the incoming data, of course, will be difficult to read, given that they will be affected in one way or another by both the disruption and the recovery efforts as they proceed. In these circumstances, I feel most comfortable falling back on fundamentals—namely, the flexibility and strength of the underlying economy, which I don’t think are affected by this. So I come out with a view that it’s appropriate to continue on our path of removing policy accommodation, and I would favor a ¼ point increase in the fed funds rate.  Having said that, I think we are getting to the point where we’ve removed a lot of accommodation.  And one of these days we need to consider that and also think about how that ought to affect the language in the statement."
"104";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have already remarked, preparing for this meeting was a lot more challenging than preparing for other recent meetings. The economy was poised for strong growth in the third and fourth quarters before Hurricane Katrina. And the forecast that the staff has developed in the Greenbook I think is reasonable, given what we know at this time.  That forecast suggests that while we may see some short-run softness, with growth below the rate we had anticipated, the rebuilding efforts clearly will add stimulus over the next year.  I am also comforted that the underlying economy was strong.  So while we are going to see a slight downtick due to the impact of the hurricane, the Greenbook forecast of real GDP growth in the mid-3 percent range over the next year indicates that we have sound economic expansion ahead.  So while uncertainty about economic growth has increased, I still believe there are much more serious clouds on the inflation horizon. The rapid rise in energy prices in the last couple of months has pushed the level of prices high enough that more firms are likely to find that they cannot absorb the increased costs and must raise prices to protect their profit margins.  This will become more so the longer that energy prices remain high. I am still hearing mixed expectations about the availability of natural gas this winter. While the impact of Katrina may not be as severe as first feared, the limited ability to expand natural gas supply, as we saw in the last two years, on top of slower fill due to hurricane damage, September 20, 2005 84 of 117 As the Greenbook notes, business spending on equipment and software has only modest forward momentum.  This is despite solid economic growth, healthy profits, and favorable financial conditions. So why is business investment so limited?  I’m going to answer this by referring to the most recent quarterly survey of CFOs conducted by Duke University with CFO Magazine. And I would note that this survey was concluded on August 28, the day before Katrina hit. I want to read to you the lead on their press release for this survey.  It says: “Corporate Optimism Plummets in Response to Housing and Fuel Concerns.”  For the first time in the four- year history of this survey, more CFOs are pessimistic than optimistic about the U.S. economy. Their number one concern is high fuel costs, ranking above health care costs for the first time. Interestingly, the survey also noted a jump in what they call their terrorism index, with one-third of the firms responding that costs to improve security and business recovery response has negatively impacted their bottom line.  I think after Katrina there will be more firms looking at their business recovery plans. As some executives have told me, with the rising costs of benefits, energy, and financing, they are closely managing discretionary items, including capital spending.  Over the next 12 months, the CFOs who participated in the survey are planning slower growth of investment; they now expect to increase capital spending by only 4.7 percent.  The survey indicates that CFOs are also worried about the housing market.  They believe the market is overheated and that a necessary and expected decline in housing prices will negatively affect their firms.  This echoes comments I’ve heard from others that a reversal in the housing market might have negative September 20, 2005 85 of 117 find the survey results consistent with other comments I’ve been hearing that the business pessimism we’re seeing is due in large part to growing concerns about rising prices on several fronts. While recent inflation numbers are very well behaved, the Greenbook does reflect a rise in the core inflation forecast over the next year.  The volatility we saw yesterday in the energy futures market, clearly due to Rita and other concerns, indicates how much the market is focusing on the unknown path for inflation that companies are facing.  While the impact on inflation may be unclear—and we know the damage to platforms out in the Gulf and the effects on refinery capacity are still being assessed—the nervousness about costs is a factor that is affecting business behavior, and it is something that we can’t ignore.  The fiscal stimulus of Katrina and the rebuilding that will result is only going to add to inflation—and that’s on top of a transportation bill that has a lot of spending on infrastructure that some of us think should have less priority than rebuilding around the Gulf Coast. The chart on page 21—and I also love these new charts—helps us keep things in perspective, in terms of the historical trends in inflation as we’ve been tightening up from meeting to meeting.  And we have to keep that in mind as we look to the future.  We know that there is still ample liquidity in financial markets, so the risks of higher inflation to me right now are much greater than the risks to economic growth. I think it’s important that at today’s meeting we give the market assurance that we will continue to focus on and be diligent in dealing with inflation, because rising costs appear to be at the heart of companies’ concerns.  To me that’s very important, and I want to support an increase September 20, 2005 86 of 117"
"105";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  For the past couple of meetings I’ve been reporting a lull in economic activity in New England, with little employment growth and muted readings on confidence.  Perhaps it was the weather or the impact of the Pentagon’s base realignment and closure (BRAC) proposals on fragile labor markets such as those in Maine but, whatever it was, the region appeared to pull out of it in late July and make some further progress in August. The weather turned bright and sunny, tourists filled the beaches, and hopes for fall tourism rose.  Employment surged by more than 13,000 jobs over the two months—that’s big in New England—with most broad industry categories showing gains.  Consumer confidence rose, as did business confidence. And the BRAC Commission decided not to follow the September 20, 2005 55 of 117 With the exception of commercial real estate, which remains in the doldrums in Boston, the outlook turned positive overall, with most contacts expecting continued growth for the remainder of 2005 and into 2006.  But, of course, this was pre-Katrina.  Since that devastating disaster, we’ve tried hard to understand the impact on the region and the nation.  Our small business advisory group met as scheduled the week after the hurricane hit, as did our board of directors. At that point things, indeed, seemed gloomy.  But as the recovery effort got on a better footing, the underlying resilience of the U.S. economy began to show through. To capture a sense of this changing scene, we made calls late last week to large national retailers and manufacturers headquartered in the First District.  Overall there were several common themes.  First, most contacts believed the pace of underlying growth had been solid and was likely to stay that way, with some negative hurricane effects this quarter and next but some positive impact thereafter.  Indeed, one of our directors whose company is a large manufacturer of semiconductor chips reported worldwide expansion on the heels of a major inventory drawdown during the first half of the year. He reported semiconductor plants everywhere working at an 85 to 90 percent capacity most recently, with strong demands for PCs and hand sets driving chip production. A major regional bank with offices throughout New England and the eastern Midwest and down to Philadelphia reported that given the yield curve, the banking business had been a bit tough, but most bank customers seemed to be doing great.  This bank and other employers reported increasing problems in finding skilled labor, even people to fill teller positions. Second, while Katrina’s devastation was terrible, our contacts were especially concerned September 20, 2005 56 of 117 materials and on consumer pocketbooks.  Consumer prices in the Boston area were on the rise prior to Katrina, with the region’s headline rate of inflation at 4 percent and core at 3 percent. The biggest area of price growth even then was for fuel and utilities, which rose almost twice as fast as nationwide over the 12 months from July ’04 to July ’05.  Given the region’s lack of homegrown energy supplies, its reliance on oil for home heating purposes, and the fact that over half of its electrical generators are now fired by natural gas brought in from outside the region, it seems clear that Boston price growth, driven by energy costs, will continue to outstrip the nation at least through the winter months.  Moreover, a pre-Katrina Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report, which I think I’ve talked about before, sees the region’s power supply at risk of widespread brownouts this winter if very cold weather puts stress on generators working at capacity. More broadly, contacts also reported that Katrina’s impact on energy costs may give them cover for price increases that prior to Katrina they’ve lacked the power to make stick. The third common theme related to the possible upside potential for reconstruction- related demand in 2006.  Manufacturers of capital goods and consumer durables anticipate a hurricane-related uptick next year.  Companies with stores and manufacturing or major distribution points in the hurricane area will have some losses, though most expect them to be covered by insurance. And one large retailer reported that while 7 to 10 out of its 120 stores in the region appeared to be total losses, business was extremely strong at stores just outside the devastated areas, such as in Baton Rouge. That company has been moving employees in the affected areas to stores in areas where business is booming.  A supplier of capital goods to the September 20, 2005 57 of 117 other defense spending but they, on balance, thought the probability was that sales to the government and other major contractors might be delayed but not canceled. Finally, there was a theme of outreach and support to employees in the affected area and of helping with disaster recovery. Almost all contacts were doing whatever they could— supplying generators and giving out free medicine and other supplies at evacuation locations.  In fact, one drugstore reported that on a daily basis they were handing out about $500,000 worth of free drugs. Supplying water purification equipment and technology to restore communications was also noted. Most companies have continued to pay their personnel and have made efforts to locate them all.  Several have made grants to those who lost everything.  They expect insurance to cover some of this and perhaps some government reimbursement, but the general attitude seemed to be to do as much as they could and to worry about how to cover the costs later.  Just as within the Reserve Banks, the reported generosity of employees in areas beyond the hurricane was amazing, with one major company alone raising at least $17 million in donations to Katrina victims in the reconstruction efforts.  So it’s not just government money that’s going into the area. There’s a lot of money from everywhere. In sum, the New England economy seems on a stronger footing than it was earlier in the summer, though the dark clouds of rising energy costs are almost certain to take a bite out of regional pocketbooks, especially if the winter is a cold one as is predicted.  This likely would have been the case without Katrina, but the related energy supply shock has made the short-term outlook a bit worse. Aside from energy, the economic effect of Katrina seems likely to be small, September 20, 2005 58 of 117 the outlook could well be positive for the larger retailers and capital goods manufacturers in the region. Turning to the Greenbook, there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty clouding the very near-term outlook.  We in Boston, probably like everybody else around the table and elsewhere, have tried our hand at estimating the impact of Katrina.  But I can’t imagine that we’re any better at it than the Board staff is.  In fact, despite the ups and downs in the quarter-to­ quarter projections, the Q4-over-Q4 GDP growth rates we see for both this year and next differ from the Greenbook only marginally.  Our forecast for the unemployment rate is the same as the Greenbook’s and, given that we see a bit more excess labor capacity, we’re a little less pessimistic about increases in core inflation next year. So despite the near-term uncertainty, the medium-term outlook seems less in question. While it seemed impossible a couple of weeks ago, as we were all riveted to the horrifying scenes on national TV, Katrina’s effect on the economy is likely to be very short term—a slower pace now and a somewhat faster pace later as reconstruction takes place. The real issue is what was happening pre-Katrina and how that plays out going forward, and we have a somewhat greater sense of certainty about that picture—or, I should say, the same level of certainty we have about any forecast.  Prior to Katrina most everything in the economy seemed to be running on all fours, though not without some causes for concern.  Shipments data for July suggested some softness in P&E spending, and inventory rebuilding at the wholesale level was less than expected, but labor markets had shown solid progress.  Financial markets had September 20, 2005 59 of 117 External growth was showing signs of life. A slowly closing output gap and higher energy costs raised concerns both about inflation down the road and possible negative effects on spending. Assuming the instant effect of Katrina on energy prices moderates, the broad economic picture seems about the same as it was before the hurricane.  That is, the best guess is growth at around potential for the next year or so, lower unemployment as labor markets continue to tighten, and more rather than less pressure on prices.  Additional fiscal stimulus from Katrina recovery efforts could be a bit of a wild card here, as there seems to be a growing tendency to throw money at the problem—money we can ill afford, given medium-term deficit expectations. Don’t get me wrong.  I think the federal government should help in the rebuilding process, but it has to be done in the context of overall fiscal discipline, which at this point seems a bit lacking. There are surely risks to the forecast.  On the downside, the higher energy prices that prevailed before Katrina might have a bigger impact on consumer spending and overall growth, particularly if the supply shock of the hurricane doesn’t ease off as expected.  Pre-Katrina shipments and orders data may foretell a flattening rather than a rebound of capital spending.  On the other hand, greater fiscal ease will certainly be an additional stimulant, and the hurricane could provide additional cover for more widespread pricing power. Productivity growth has slowed, and we hear reports of labor being hard to find. Combine these reports with the slowly falling unemployment rate, and a surge in wage and salary growth as measured by the ECI, which we haven’t seen yet, may not be far off the mark. As a matter of risk management, it seems to me for now that appearing to be complacent about simultaneous energy demand and supply shocks and diminishing excess capacity might September 20, 2005 60 of 117 greater downside effects if they were to emerge.  Those effects could be addressed in a timely way by pausing, but at this point I don’t see a need to take that step. Thus, I’m in favor of continuing our process of removing policy accommodation at this meeting.  Incoming economic data could well convince us of the need to stay put some time soon, or we might find it necessary to continue our upward trek longer or at a faster pace than we now are expecting. But at this point, continuing to remove policy accommodation at the “measured pace” we’ve been doing seems about right."
"106";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The contours of the economic effects of Hurricane Katrina that are laid out in the Greenbook baseline look about right to me.  But in the aftermath of the hurricane, and with the fragility in the energy markets, I found myself focusing September 20, 2005 71 of 117 business contacts, they appear to have more anxiety about future prospects than about the present circumstances.  My business contacts who have retail stores, warehouses, and production facilities in the Gulf region all seem to have a good handle on the direct impacts of the storm, and for the most part they say that their losses are manageable.  But they emphasize that the indirect effects of the storm, driven primarily by increases in costs of energy and building materials prices, will be difficult to discern for many months. Of particular concern to many of my directors is the reaction of consumers to the expense of filling their gas tanks and heating their homes during the winter.  My directors report that they are already witnessing some retrenchment in consumer spending, and they don’t know how much of this is just a temporary reaction or how much of it is a preview of more adjustments to come.   The preliminary release of the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment survey illustrates this concern, and I think the Greenbook’s “sentiment slump” alternative scenario addresses the policy issues that such a development would entail. The latest spike in energy prices triggered by Katrina also has implications for the inflation outlook. On the positive side, most reports that I have been getting still have the flavor of businesses unable to pass on higher costs to their customers. Nevertheless, the headline and core inflation reports are likely to look scary for the next several months.  Fortunately, as several of my contacts have explained, more than the usual number of price increases are taking the form of surcharges that are expected to be removed when energy and other raw materials prices recede. To the extent that this practice lies behind some of the near-term bad news that we are seeing on the inflation front, there is still reason to think that the Greenbook baseline projection September 20, 2005 72 of 117 scenario highlights a risk to the outlook that also troubles me a great deal.  I’m very pleased that we’ve enjoyed the public’s confidence regarding our commitment to containing long-term inflation expectations for as long as we have during the successive energy price increases that we’ve been hit with, but I’m not anxious to test the limits of that confidence. Even if the odds of the sentiment slump and the deteriorating inflation expectations scenarios are similar, the policy implications are not.  The Greenbook projects a GDP difference in those two scenarios that is very small, but the difference in the projected inflation outcomes is too sizable for me to ignore.  Consequently, I think the more prudent course of action today is for us to continue to remove our policy accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"107";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.   It goes without saying that the devastation September 20, 2005 51 of 117 economic effects, we’re paying special attention to energy and international trade.  So far, at least, the effects on the Twelfth District economy appear to have been muted. Since the end of August, retail gasoline prices are up about 30 cents per gallon on the West Coast, less than elsewhere in the nation.  There was some early concern that Gulf Port cargo would be diverted to the West Coast, creating bottlenecks or significantly increasing shipping costs, but these concerns have largely dissipated. Our contacts remain fairly optimistic about the prospects for the regional economy but are very concerned about the future path of energy prices, especially since Hurricane Katrina. Even before the hurricane, they were worried that higher gasoline prices and impending increases in home heating expenses would curb consumer demand.  Indeed, PG&E, the public utility for northern California, just announced that rising natural gas prices could drive home heating costs in the area up by as much as 40 percent this winter.  Discount retailers in the District expect these increases to put a dent in holiday spending.  In addition, higher fuel prices already have trickled into prices for building materials, and contacts expect post-hurricane rebuilding efforts to boost those prices further and lengthen queues on some orders. Turning to the national economy, I share the Greenbook’s assessment of the near-term impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic growth. Pre-Katrina, the outlook was for very strong growth in the second half of 2005.  It now seems likely that second-half growth will be substantially reduced due to the disruptions to production in the Gulf region and the negative impact of the run-up in energy prices on consumer spending.  Of course, over this time frame September 20, 2005 52 of 117 While the proposed policy statement associated with alternative B acknowledges increased uncertainty about economic performance in the near term, I believe that the uncertainties associated with the medium-term outlook have also risen substantially, and risks now exist that in my view pose a clear and persistent threat.  On the upside, rebuilding commitments are escalating by the day.  The recovery and bounceback fueled by massive fiscal stimulus could more than make up for the slowdown this winter, propelling the economy on an unsustainable upward trajectory similar to the optimistic scenario laid out in the Greenbook. But downside risks to growth also loom.  Rebuilding schedules could easily slip. Moreover, the pace of restarting closed oil and natural gas platforms and rigs in the Gulf of Mexico has leveled off, and the prognosis for restarting the remaining closed facilities as well as refineries and natural gas treatment plants remains in question.  If disruptions persist or further shocks to supply occur, the economy could develop more along the lines of the pessimistic scenario in the Greenbook. Moreover, we may not yet have seen the full brunt on spending of the pre-Katrina energy price increases.  It’s sobering to note that in the postwar period, the U.S. economy has rarely escaped such severe run-ups in oil prices without suffering a significant downturn. Turning to inflation, I was quite concerned at our August meeting by the elevated rate of core PCE inflation, which was skirting the top of my comfort zone.  Since that meeting, I’ve become more confident that core inflation remains well contained.  Recent data on core price inflation have been encouraging. Core PCE prices have risen at a 1½ percent rate over the six months through July, right in the middle of my preferred range, and core CPI inflation has also September 20, 2005 53 of 117 index and from the household survey, a series that our research staff has recently started compiling and tracking.  These remain remarkably subdued.  The elevated rate of growth in compensation per hour from the productivity and cost report over the past year far exceeds the readings provided by these other series and may be more an outlier than a strong signal of tight labor markets and wage pressures. While my comfort level with respect to core inflation has improved since August, the Board’s staff has raised the Greenbook forecast of core PCE price inflation in 2006 by 0.2 of a percentage point to 2.3 percent due to the run-up in energy prices since the August meeting.  I must say that I actually found the low-inflation alternative simulation in the Greenbook more compelling.  This scenario assumes that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and it shows core inflation falling over the next two years, reaching 1½ percent in 2007. On that point, the relative stability of longer-term break-even inflation rates derived from the TIPS market this year, even as oil prices surged, provides evidence that the public remains confident in the Committee’s commitment to price stability.  Of course, the jump in inflation expectations seen in this month’s preliminary Michigan survey was worrisome, but we must be cautious not to read too much into that report since it was taken so soon after Katrina. To assess the likely pass-through of energy into core consumer inflation, our staff has estimated Phillips curve type forecasting models akin to those employed at the Board.  An important finding emerges.  Changes in real oil prices did have an economically and statistically significant effect on core inflation, but only up to the early 1980s.  Importantly for the current situation, they find no evidence of such a relationship in the data since the early ’80s.  The September 20, 2005 54 of 117 inflation expectations.  During the 1970s, they became unmoored from price stability but now appear to be well anchored, as in the Greenbook’s low inflation scenario. With respect to policy, I support a 25 basis point rate increase rather than a pause today. A pause at this meeting justified by a need to further assess Katrina’s impact would be sensible if we actually expected to know a lot more about the medium-term outlook by November, but that’s unlikely to be the case. A pause could counterproductively mislead market participants about the likely future path of policy or create the misimpression that the Fed is unduly pessimistic about the outlook.  So I consider it wiser to stick with our “measured pace” approach for now. I think it’s well justified by the Greenbook forecast, uncertain as it is, and consistent with market expectations.  But going forward, we obviously need to be flexible and adjust our views about where we’re ultimately heading on the basis of new data and forecasts."
"108";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20050920meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The balance of evidence since our last meeting still supports, in our view, a reasonably positive outlook for output and inflation. If we look through, as we should, the transitory effects of Katrina and the reconstruction, and if we factor in what the futures market tells us about the expected magnitude and duration of the rise in energy prices, we still see an economy growing slightly above trend with core inflation following a path somewhat, but not substantially, above our preferred range. The fundamentals still seem favorable to continued expansion with solid productivity growth, strong corporate balance sheets, reasonable growth in household income, and favorable financial conditions. And on the strength of this view, with real interest rates still quite low, we believe that we need to continue to tighten monetary policy at this meeting and beyond.  At the September 20, 2005 73 of 117 Now, of course, the degree and balance of uncertainty has changed.  We face a higher degree of overall uncertainty. It will be harder to assess over the next few quarters the underlying pace of demand growth.  The rise of energy prices pre-Katrina—some of which remains even as the initial effects of the hurricane on expectations have washed out of energy markets, except for natural gas—creates some risk of a larger shock to confidence and behavior than seems to have been evident over the last two years.  Damage from future hurricanes to energy and product output may prove harder to bridge through the release of international product reserves. Our capacity to discern the underlying rate of inflation is also somewhat diminished, perhaps less because of the effect of energy prices than the difficulty of sorting out what is actually happening to productivity growth and unit labor costs. Apart from reducing overall confidence around the forecasts, the balance of risks has probably shifted, too—shifted toward a somewhat higher probability of slower growth relative to the path of potential output and toward a greater risk of a larger and more persistent rise in core inflation. If the former risk materialized, the latter might be mitigated.  These are risks across the spectrum of scenarios, rather than the most probable combination. But to acknowledge the change in uncertainty is not to suggest that it would be appropriate for us to stop or to push down the expected path of the nominal fed funds rate until we can better assess what we do not know now. The net effect of the changes to the outlook, on balance, probably does not alter the desirable path of the nominal fed funds rate relative to what we thought in mid-August.  With the real rate still rather low, my inclination would be to continue to weight the upside risk to inflation as greater than the prospective risk of a significant September 20, 2005 74 of 117 growth is still only prospective. This implies that the slope of the expected fed funds rate should remain materially positive, even if we move today.  And I think we would be better off after this meeting if the markets raised the expected path a bit than if the path were to fall from its pre- meeting trajectory. I think we probably know a little less today than we did in August about how far we are going to have to move, even if the economy appears to be following the path of our forecast.  If we move today, all we know is that we’re 25 basis points higher than we were.  The fact that we are that much closer to some point we can’t measure is a less valuable observation.  We may even know less today about where equilibrium lies and whether that range has moved.  And, of course, we still face some probability that we’ll have to move past it, or past what in retrospect we thought was equilibrium. Most of the hard questions we face look pretty much like they did at the last meeting. How strong and durable can we expect the expansion to be in the face of less optimism about future housing price gains or other factors that could cause household saving to rise and consumption to grow more slowly?  Will this dramatic rise in energy prices over the past two years cause more substantial damage to business and consumer confidence?  Will the world’s private savers continue to be willing to acquire claims on the United States at the higher rate implied by our current account forecast, and to do so on such favorable terms?  Will business margins start to erode in a way that will portend slower investment and employment growth? Will the U.S. political system be able to make a credible effort in the near term to improve our medium-term fiscal position and sustain our relatively open trade policy?  And, if not, do we risk September 20, 2005 75 of 117 These are all factors that could hurt future growth, but that doesn’t mean that monetary policy should be more accommodative than would otherwise make sense in anticipation of those negative effects or should try to preempt them.  Rather, these familiar imbalances and concerns make the cost of any erosion in our credibility greater.  Thank you."
"109";"CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  All right.  Are there any further questions for our colleagues? If not, would somebody like to start?

[Coffee break],   Vice Chair.,   Governor Kohn.,   Governor Olson.,   Governor Bies.,  Governor Ferguson.,  I knew him well.  [Laughter],  Thank you.  Mr. Reinhart."
"110";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like others, I am somewhat, though not fully, reassured by the incoming data.  The economy clearly appears to be on an expansionary track, not having been seriously damaged by the seriously damaging hurricanes.  Additionally, readings of core inflation have been surprisingly benign, given everything we know from our models and the anecdotal data we’ve heard from others on the cumulative effect of the rise in energy prices.  More importantly, during the intermeeting period, inflation expectations for both the next five years and for the 5- to 10-year horizons are little changed.  At least they have not changed much since the last November 1, 2005 75 of 114 As the earlier dialogue between Vincent and the Chairman indicated, I did ask the staff to give me some information on how inflation expectations and energy prices interact.  Let me summarize just three points from that data.  First, of all the categories of energy prices—spot crude, gasoline, far futures, natural gas, and heating oil—it seems that spot crude is the one that drives inflation expectations most firmly.  Second, as Vincent indicated, across the 2-year, 5-year, and 10-year horizons for inflation expectations, the 2-year horizon is really the one that is most heavily influenced by spot crude oil prices.  And third, as I think Vincent said, even there the impact on inflation expectations of spot crude in the 2-year horizon is relatively muted: A 1 percent increase in spot crude oil prices, at least in these models, tends to go to a 0.7 basis point increase in inflation expectations.  So while we’re aware of the importance of energy prices, it turns out that in terms of driving inflation expectations, there are many other things that are equally important. Having said all of that, let me now turn to the broader issues of import at this meeting, which are what to do and also what to say.  Someone quoted Yogi Berra.  I’m going to quote that equally famous poet, Archilochus, whom some of you may recall from the 7th century B.C.  [Laughter],  He famously said, “The fox knows many little things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.”  The reason that’s important here is that while the various readings we’ve had on the incoming data are extremely important, in some ways they are in the category of “many little things.” And the one big thing—the big thing that Dave noted in his opening remarks—is that the staff now has a forecast for the next 18 to 24 months of an economy that, with just one or two more tightening moves, is likely to enter a phase of growth below trend, with inflation pressures gradually November 1, 2005 76 of 114 variable lags, the impact of the cumulative tightening that we’ve undertaken.  And the forecast does indeed show that the economy is likely to slowly respond to our tightening regime. I find this actually quite credible because I believe, as does the staff, that the funds rate is probably within the range of its equilibrium real level and will certainly be within that range with one or two or more tightenings.  I think it’s fairly important to put that on the table. While I fully respect Don’s view that one can’t put too much weight on these point estimates, I think it is important for a Committee of our sort to have some sense of whether or not we’re in the range of equilibrium. Having said that, I do think a number of forces are pulling and pushing against the economy and leading us to this level.  Here I would pick up on a point that President Lacker made—and I certainly agree with him—that the impact of these hurricanes is more likely to have been on the supply side than on the demand side.  However, I would say that that’s a partial equilibrium analysis.  And ceteris is clearly not paribus in this case, because there are a number of forces that are also driving the demand side independently of the hurricanes.  Let me just highlight two or three of them.  One I continue to be worried about is the mystery of what it is that’s driving businesses. Dave raised in his opening remarks the point I’ve made a few times—that the investment/GDP ratio still seems relatively low, certainly compared to its level in the last decade. There is some survey evidence that CEOs and CFOs still have some uncertainty.  Anecdotal discussions that I and some others have had suggest that some of this uncertainty has to do with whether or not to invest in the United States or overseas.  And the second part of the uncertainty is still, I think, a lingering concern that these elevated energy prices will eventually play through to lower demand. While others may disagree, I think the large negative net equity issuance and the willingness November 1, 2005 77 of 114 ample liquidity, is primarily a sign that businesses are somewhat skeptical about their ability to reward shareholders with a reasonable future return on internal investment.  And, therefore, they may be holding back on investment.  I’d also say that the slightly negative guidance from businesses during this earnings season reinforces this view that there’s some downward pressure that shows up in a slightly lower equilibrium rate than we would have had otherwise. Second, I would pick up on a point that both Don Kohn and Sue Bies made having to do with developments in the housing sector, and why for households in particular there is a sudden fall-off in the demand for HELOCs [home equity lines of credit].  Again, I think that creates a little bit of downward pressure on the neutral rate. We may also see during the next couple of years an increase in the saving rate, both for the reasons that the staff talked about and also due to continuing uncertainty about pensions, which has surely been very much in the newspapers.  I think that, plus the ongoing discussions about Social Security reform, will perhaps drive households to save more. And finally, to pick up on Karen’s point—a point that we haven’t talked about much today—I think net exports during the forecast horizon are likely, if anything, to continue to be a drag, if I can use that word, though I understand your mathematical point.,  They will be an arithmetic subtraction from measured GDP in the U.S. economy. I think all of the conditions that have driven that in the past, including foreign exchange rates, relative interest rates, and most importantly the productivity story and an absence of domestic absorption overseas, are likely to result in the external sector being an arithmetic subtraction from November 1, 2005 78 of 114 In my view, all of those things lead to a credible story that says we are, or soon will be, in the range of the neutral rate.  But what does all that mean?  I think it means that we should clearly be vigilant about inflation because there are some upside pressures, but I agree with Cathy and others that we don’t have to be vigilantes about inflation.  To put it another way, I think the scenario in the Greenbook that has us going to an interest rate of 5 percent, driving the economy to a growth rate that’s far below potential, opening up an output gap, and having unemployment of 5.5 percent, is not something that we need to embrace.  In fact, it’s something that we need to be cautious about. So that’s my view on what to do.  The implication, obviously, is that I’m quite comfortable with a 25 basis point move today, and I won’t preclude future discussion by suggesting what we ought to do going forward.  But I don’t find the Greenbook implicit assumption terribly unattractive. The second question then, obviously, is what to say.  I applaud Janet for opening that topic.  In my view it’s important for it to be on the table.  I come out at a different place from where Janet comes out and also from where I think Don comes out.  I’m not comfortable keeping this language until we think we’re done, because I’m not sure we’ll ever really know that with enough certainty.  I think the language does need to evolve.  I agree with Tim’s view that it seems a little stale at this stage.  I would very much be in the camp of favoring some forward-looking language of one sort of another.  The sort that I prefer is the kind of language that deals with the outlook in terms of our dual mandate, with respect to both growth and inflation.  I know that in the period I’ve been here there were times when growth and inflation were not pointing in the same direction or when the risks to our growth and inflation objectives differed substantially.  So I think we need to separate them. I recognize that the market only wants to know what’s going to happen with regard to interest November 1, 2005 79 of 114 little uncomfortable going that far with our forward-looking language, because we know that there are many factors that can change the outlook between one meeting and another.  So I’d be very cautious about that. I do encourage us to have this discussion in an orderly fashion between now and December, and maybe again between December and January.  But having said all of that, Mr. Chairman, I think what to do and what to say today are fairly clear.  Thank you."
"111";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  I lost.,   Mr. Chairman, growth in the Eleventh District, if anything, has been accelerating in recent months—picking up steam.  We appear to be the beneficiary of the natural disasters that have taken place on the Gulf Coast, and that continued, incidentally, through Wilma. A small example is that the grapefruit growers have definitely benefited from the destruction of grapefruit crops in Florida, which was nearly total.  If I were to paraphrase Yogi Berra, who said the future isn’t what it used to be, I think I would be on the mark because we’re now much more confident. One of the most articulate, smartest, and at the same time conservative, bankers in our District, Dick Evans of Cullen/Frost, says that building contacts are reporting the busiest business activity in 30 or 40 years in our state.  At the very front end, which is site work for land development, one of his clients, an engineer, reported that in his entire business career he’s never been busier.  So we are proceeding on all pistons, and we’re beginning to see it reflected particularly in real estate prices. The market has gone from a buyer’s market to a seller’s market almost overnight.  In the Gulf area of Padre Island, for example, record prices are now suddenly appearing overnight. So in summary, the bankers and the business community in the Eleventh District, as I reported at the last session, are still frisky, Mr. Chairman.  Indeed, their tails are wagging at an accelerated November 1, 2005 32 of 114 that history doesn’t repeat itself here.  But we certainly have a much more enthusiastic business community. I want to turn now to a broader perspective, based on our calls to headquarters of companies that operate throughout the nation as well as in our District.  At the last FOMC meeting, Mr. Chairman, you mentioned gasoline prices having a very visible impact as one of the few commodities that consumers look at for price comparisons.  In talking to our retailers, that is clearly the case. In sharing with President Poole our contacts with Wal-Mart, I talked to the new CEO of U.S. Wal-Mart yesterday, and he noted that while October same-store sales were up 4.2 percent, the consumption pattern had shifted.  Because of gasoline prices, people are making fewer trips to the stores but they’re buying larger amounts. And we have a leading indicator ourselves in Harvey Rosenblum, who is the wine connoisseur amongst our research leaders in Dallas.  I’ve noticed that he, since he lives in a dry district of Dallas —we still have prohibition in parts of Texas—is making less frequent trips to the wine store but is buying in greater volume.  Perhaps that’s because of the questions we’re asking him!  [Laughter] Wal-Mart, 7-Eleven, and Dollar General all report that heavier items transported by truck— dog food and bottled water are just two examples—are under tremendous price pressure due to rising fuel costs. And these higher prices are being passed on, although sometimes offset by consumers substituting private label items for brand name products.  American Airlines is passing on their fuel costs.  They managed to raise their average fare 8 percent in the third quarter.  Once again we hear them talking about $25 attachments to confirmation fees for standby passengers. Hovnanian and Centex, two of the largest builders, report rising costs of locally sourced materials delivered by truck, adding to price pressures of labor and materials for roofing, siding, and November 1, 2005 33 of 114 on by the express companies. UPS reports—and I don’t think this is public information—that they’re targeting rate increases, pre-fuel charge, of 4 percent to be set in early November, knowing that the U.S. Postal Service will be pricing in an increase of 5 percent plus at the beginning of the new year. There are some potential mitigating factors here.  7-Eleven, Exxon, Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Club stores, and other gas retailers report that the margin they are retaining on their gas sales—and 53 percent of 7-Eleven’s revenue comes from gasoline sales now—is still running 30 cents versus 13 to 14 cents normally. They expect to hold these margins as long as they can, or at least until volatility is dampened; but as gas prices ease, this could possibly be a cushion that will provide some relief for retailers. And the correlation is quite direct.  At 7-Eleven, for example, they can walk you through, week by week, the effect on sales of each downward movement in the price of gasoline. Three weeks ago they had an increase in sales volume of 2 percent; two weeks ago, 4 percent; and this last week, 6 percent. So we may have a little bit of relief coming from the reduction of margins that might occur as the margins go from 30 to 13 to 14 cents. It’s still clear from our discussions with business operators that price pressures are building. A rising percentage of companies are experiencing price increases for what they sell as well as for what they buy, along the lines that President Moskow mentioned.  We see it particularly in chemicals, as he mentioned.  Caustic soda, formerly priced at $450 a dry ton, is now $800 a dry ton. Polyethylene, formerly priced at 38 cents a pound, is now priced at 55 cents a pound.   I hope this is expunged later, but Exxon’s CEO told me that they will take every measure they can to pass through, and I quote, “sizable increases” on that front in every place that they can.  Perhaps the best indicator of what’s happening in the chemical industry is Pioneer Core Alkaline Company, which November 1, 2005 34 of 114 to pass along price increases for all resin-based products, such as garden chairs and outdoor tables, in the spring.  The rails appear to be planning, according to BNSF’s CEO, a price increase of 5 to 6 percent before fuel surcharges next year. And of interest in all of our discussions is that we’re hearing what President Moskow is hearing, which is that there are pressures on the wage front.  To be sure, they are mitigated by Delphi, Northwest Airlines, and also GM.  But the numbers we’re hearing from the rails, from the Belo Corporation, a large broadcaster, and others on labor prices are negotiation targets of about 3 percent, with a heavy focus on health care running in the 9 to 10 percent range. I think probably the best summary, Mr. Chairman, came from the CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.  He said that “previously we were deflating and we can still offset a little bit through China, although to a lesser degree than before.”  He said “we will early-discount like all retailers, moving our discount season, largely in terms of announcements, up to November 1.  But at best we hope to ‘hold the line’ on prices.”  That’s a direct quote. So I feel that the heightened inflationary pressures that we talked about last time are lurking. Against that background, I favor further tightening to contain inflationary impulses and expectations.  I have some comments on the statement, but we can speak about that later.  The bottom line is that one can sense, even though we don’t see it in the data, inflation pressures creeping up like little cat’s feet.  Thank you."
"112";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me first share some thoughts on recent economic developments in our Southeast region.  As you would expect, we’ve continued to assess the regional and national implications of Hurricane Katrina, and now Hurricanes Rita and Wilma, which have added to our woes. The recent employment statistics serve as a real-time barometer of the hit our region has taken.  Across the states involved, through September our District has lost approximately 300,000 jobs from the storms.  Ironically, businesses in the affected areas trying to restart their operations November 1, 2005 46 of 114 downtown New Orleans, one sees help wanted signs on every corner.  The inability to get evacuees from the area back into local housing has clearly slowed the process of business recovery.  In fact, if one thing related to the storms now stands out, it’s the lingering uncertainty on several fronts and what now looks to us to be a longer rebuilding and recovery period. Indications are that it could well be several more months before oil and gas production and processing return to near normal.  The latest reports from our contacts indicate that almost 7 percent of U.S. daily oil production and 9½ percent of U.S. natural gas production remain shut in.  The assessment of damage and the repairs to pipeline and production facilities in the Gulf continue to be hampered by equipment and labor shortages. Louisiana refineries are slowly coming back on line, but by current estimates up to 6 percent of total U.S. refining capacity will remain off line until at least early next year.  And U.S. refineries are reportedly now operating at only about 80 percent of capacity. The situation with respect to natural gas is even less clear than for refined products, and there remains widespread concern that potential shortages over the winter could keep natural gas prices elevated for a while. At the time of our last meeting, I expressed concern about the impact of the storms on shipping and port facilities. It now appears that activity is slowly returning to the Port of New Orleans, constrained by labor availability and access to land transportation.  By and large, ships that were inbound to New Orleans were diverted to other ports, so there wasn’t as much disruption to the nation’s imports as there was to those exports that depended upon the Mississippi River and Louisiana ports. At the last meeting I also indicated that while we expected a significant regional hit to output, that would quickly be replaced by spending on cleanup and rebuilding.  This is generally happening, November 1, 2005 47 of 114 year when insurance assessments have been completed and comprehensive plans are put in place. Commercial contractors note that there was a strong backlog of work prior to the hurricanes; and this, coupled with labor shortages, will constrain the pace of rebuilding at least for a while. At the national level, I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that despite our heartaches along the Gulf Coast, the national economy seems to have remained relatively strong. And this was reinforced by last Friday’s initial reading of third-quarter real GDP. I view the economy as continuing on a path of about trend.  However, I continue to wonder how the consumer will respond to higher energy prices.  So far, the impact hasn’t been great, but there may be some important substitution effects when the consumer is faced with substantially higher heating costs during the winter on top of still-elevated gasoline prices.  Spending may not decline, but more household funds may be allocated to energy and less to other goods and services, and this could cause second-round effects in terms of cutbacks in production and investment.  In addition, we do know that auto sales dropped early in the fourth quarter, due in part to energy concerns but also due to a retreat from employee pricing. I’ve gotten some recent and interesting anecdotal information that is consistent with my concern about consumption and consumer substitution effects.  Last week I chatted with a major wholesale supplier of groceries who has seen a significant recent pickup in business.  He noted that core wholesale grocery sales are notoriously steady and boring, and he attributed the measurable pickup in recent weeks to the fact that more people were likely eating in and, hence, were buying more groceries.  Similarly, an Atlanta director who is president of a major building materials and consumer products firm noted that his away-from-home product sales—staples like paper towels and toilet tissue sold to restaurants—were slowing and that retail home product sales were up.  He November 1, 2005 48 of 114 This same director, however, also commented on how serious the price pressures were due to energy and freight costs.  His company experienced a substantial earnings decline in the third quarter, as he wasn’t able to pass on all of his cost increases to his customers.  Taken together, recent data and these kinds of anecdotes suggest to me that downside risks to consumer spending still remain elevated. This brings me to the inflation risk, which is my major concern.  As already noted by a number of people, we experienced a significant increase in both headline CPI and PPI inflation last month, which was expected.  This was largely due to energy and, in my view, is likely to be temporary.  At the same time, the core measures remained relatively stable, but the anecdotes about growing price pressures and actual or intended price increases seem to be at odds with this continuing, going forward.  I note, too, like others, that the Greenbook has built in more of a pass- through of energy and other price increases into core inflation next year. There are some possible explanations that we’ve all given at one time or another for this seeming disconnect, including the fact that the economy is relatively more energy-efficient and that we are evolving into a more service-oriented economy so that energy is a much less direct component of consumption.  And perhaps most importantly, there’s the fact that intense competition is limiting the ability to pass input price increases through to customers—for instance, the difficulty I noted earlier that the consumer products firm was having in passing on energy costs.  A large athletic apparel manufacturer in our District, the Russell Corporation, attributed a large share of their third-quarter earnings decline to higher costs for poly-cotton blends that could not be passed on, very specifically because of intense foreign competition. But these questions about pricing power are not, in my view, reasons to be complacent about November 1, 2005 49 of 114 in the system, and significant fiscal spending associated with hurricane-related rebuilding has yet to come on stream. My concern is that deviating from our path of gradually removing policy accommodation at this time could signal that we are less concerned about inflation and, therefore, cause some deterioration in inflation expectations.  It is this threat that I think we need to guard against.   I view the cost of ratcheting down inflation expectations, should they get out of hand, as being great.  So I’d argue that we need to continue on our current path, at least for a while longer, including raising our fed funds target rate by 25 basis points today. As several of us have said today and in previous recent meetings, deciding what to say following today’s meeting may be more difficult than deciding what to do.  Realizing that our discussion of the statement often gets truncated, I also want to put down a brief marker.  Given my concern about keeping inflation expectations in check, I would prefer a statement that is somewhere between Bluebook alternatives B and C.  I’m concerned that “C” is too strong, but I am particularly uncomfortable with the balance of risk characterization in option B.  President Yellen has just offered some attractive statement language for us to consider, and I think it’s terribly important that we make time at this meeting or at some other meeting in the near future to begin to talk about that seriously.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"113";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, thank you.  My views on the national outlook remain pretty much unchanged from the last meeting.  I think growth will be somewhat slower in the second half of this year and then stronger next year due to the reconstruction activity.  The rise in energy prices will have a dampening effect on growth to some degree.  Nonetheless, the resilience that the U.S. economy has so far experienced following the hurricanes suggests that real GDP will grow at above trend, at least over the near-term forecast period.  Several other factors are consistent with that: Financial conditions remain supportive; fiscal policy is stimulative; and as I’ve noted and many have already mentioned here today, there is a momentum in the economy. Evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this outlook.  District manufacturing activity continues to expand at a solid pace, and capital spending plans at District factories have rebounded, after dipping slightly following the hurricanes.  As a further sign of solid business confidence, hiring announcements for District businesses have exceeded layoff announcements by a wide margin since the last meeting. On the negative side, though, higher energy prices have eroded consumer confidence in our region as well as nationally, leading to somewhat slower consumer spending.  For example, retailers contacted in the first half of October reported sales were generally unchanged from a year ago, a November 1, 2005 53 of 114 sales. Homes in some parts of our District have been taking a little longer to sell, causing some builders to lower their prices or at least increase the incentives around the sales efforts. Turning to inflation, let me talk a little bit about evidence from our District, because we are seeing further inflationary pressures.  Wage pressures, while still modest, are beginning to show through. Manufacturers are reporting sharply higher costs for natural gas and petroleum-based raw materials.  Some of our manufacturers are also reporting increased costs of building materials, such as steel and lumber, as a result of the reconstruction effort elsewhere.  But adding to this, District manufacturers are finding it somewhat easier, as others have noted, to pass their higher costs on to customers.  For example, in the special question we asked this month, 30 percent of the firms said that their pricing power had increased over the last three months, but only 14 percent said their pricing power had decreased.  Retailers have also been showing somewhat greater determination to raise prices to cover their higher costs, although the retail price increases have been mostly modest so far. With this said, I want to tell Dave that I think today’s report on the Greenbook and the discussion have been very, very helpful.  It’s beginning to redirect the discussion from one of a clear position of removing accommodation to a discussion of the correct range for the fed funds rate and where it should fall if we are to maintain stable prices and sustainable growth. Obviously, I share with others here the view that inflation is currently the main concern. Energy is an obvious pressure, there is strong momentum in much of the economy, and there are some signs of changing inflationary expectations.  I think this is something we have to be alert to. But since our policy actions today have their final effects months in the future, I think it’s also important that we begin to address inflation and whether the rise is transitory because of the energy November 1, 2005 54 of 114 going forward.  If it is transitory, then the question is, I think legitimately, where should we stop? What is the right range?  Is it near where we are now or should it go higher? For now, my own views are that we should be moving the funds rate somewhat higher, as others have suggested, and that this perhaps would be a reasonable place to stop.  What exactly is the appropriate area, I think, should be a continued focus of this Committee’s discussions in the meetings ahead.  I would also share the sentiment that we need to carefully rethink the FOMC statement coming out of these meetings.  I think it is becoming badly out of date and, as a result, may lose credibility.  So now is the time to start a serious discussion about changing it.  I welcome Janet’s comments and others here today. Thank you."
"114";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unlike President Geithner, I view the incoming information over the intermeeting period as having mixed implications for what might be required from us to keep inflation in check.  On the one hand, demand and output, as he noted, appear to be continuing to grow at a pace that over time is likely to gradually put added pressure on resources. Apparently, the tightening of monetary policy, the rise in energy prices, and the appreciation of the dollar in the first half of the year were not enough to slow growth to trend in the third quarter.  And the September employment report and October data on initial claims suggest that the underlying pace of job creation has been maintained going into the fourth quarter.  Moreover, demand over the next few quarters, as many of you pointed out, should be boosted by the ramping up of rebuilding efforts. Still, conditions do seem to be in place for a moderation in growth over the intermediate term. Financial conditions have tightened.  Interest rates have moved higher; in response the exchange rate has firmed and stock prices have dropped a little.  All of the increase since the last meeting was in real interest rates, and most of the rise didn’t seem to be in response to data, but rather to our own speeches, making it unambiguously restraining.  In addition, volatilities have backed up a little and risk spreads have widened just a little since the middle of the summer, suggesting that investors are a bit less confident about the future, even if they’re still too confident. Data and anecdotes on housing markets hint at some moderation, and that began even before the recent rise in rates, perhaps as a consequence of the earlier increases in interest rates as well as the elevated level of house prices relative to incomes.  Home equity loans at banks actually fell last month, suggesting that equity extraction is no longer so attractive.  But as best we can tell, without a November 1, 2005 66 of 114 slowed, while price increases for condos have moderated very little and remain quite high.  All in all, we seem to have reached an inflection point in the housing market, fortunately.  And house price increases, working through the wealth channel and as an inducement to construction, should be less of a stimulus to demand in the future, though how much and how fast is a very open question. Higher energy prices could take something off of consumption, even after gasoline prices decline in coming months.  Natural gas prices will be elevated through the winter heating season. And the negative results of consumer sentiment surveys—which persisted into October, even as gas prices declined—could be suggesting a more marked response than we’ve seen over the past few years of increases. In the staff forecasts these forces slow the economy to a rate of growth slightly below its potential, even with a slight easing of financial conditions as policy firms less than the market has built in.   It’s as good a guess as any and better than any forecast I might make.  Given the range of uncertainty, however, the important point for us at this meeting is that growth is likely to slow to closer to the rate of growth of potential, but it’s probably going to take at least a couple more policy firmings. The news on prices and costs has been more favorable for the inflation outlook.  Core inflation has been damped, despite substantial increases in energy prices before the hurricanes.  Because the increases in the prices of petroleum and petroleum products have been large and sustained, they are more likely to show through to core prices than at any time since 1980.  But I’m encouraged by the lack of much response so far this year.  And energy prices themselves have eased off much more than expected when we last met. Pass-through effects of past increases in energy prices in the staff forecast are magnified and November 1, 2005 67 of 114 results of the Michigan Survey are cautionary, but long-run forward measures of inflation compensation in the market have risen only modestly, and they do remain well below their levels of last year and the early part of this year.  I suspect that household inflation expectations will ease back if gasoline prices retreat, as they are expected to. Business labor costs are probably not putting much upward pressure on prices.  The trend in ECI compensation continues to be favorable, including wages and salaries increasing at a 2½ percent rate for several quarters now.  The lack of upward pressure is especially noteworthy in the face of huge increases in consumer energy costs, and it seems inconsistent with tightness in labor markets that might begin to escalate costs at prevailing levels of resource utilization.  And productivity growth in the third quarter was strong, holding down the rise in unit labor costs.  In the Greenbook, compensation and core prices accelerate noticeably over coming quarters.  In my view, incoming price and compensation data raise the odds that the pickup could be a bit smaller, with inflation settling at a slightly lower level if output follows the Greenbook path. On attitudes, we’ve had competing anecdotes at this meeting.  Most of you—I think the majority of you—seem to suggest that businesses are sensing some increased pricing power.  That would, if it’s true, support the staff forecast; but it hasn’t shown through in actual prices paid by consumers as of yet.  Because the economy seems to have a good deal of forward momentum at a time when resource utilization is high, and because higher energy prices do threaten to feed through to core prices and inflation expectations, we need to continue firming until we have some better indications that conditions are in place to keep inflation restrained. Underlying trends in output and employment will be obscured by the effects of the hurricanes, including the onset of rebuilding efforts, and this circumstance probably amplifies the already November 1, 2005 68 of 114 neutral federal funds rate, will be in reducing the risk of overshooting.  They do provide a rough guide that we’re in the neighborhood, but I don’t think they’re a very precise measurement.  In that regard, I myself am not uncomfortable retaining the “accommodative” language until we decide we don’t need to tighten anymore.  I’ve defined accommodative for my own purposes as too low [laughter]—too low to accomplish my objectives. I think we can mitigate the risk of overshooting in policy by keeping our eyes on the underlying drivers of resource utilization and demand—such as housing prices and household reaction to energy prices, as well as cost pressures and inflation expectations.  And I do think the “measured pace” of tightening has been helpful in this regard as well, in contrast to 1994 and 1995 when tightening picked up at the end and I think the risk of overshooting increased.  I’m comfortable with tightening again at this meeting and signaling that we do not think we are finished removing accommodation.  But just what we should signal about our expectations for the future will require a fresh look at each meeting, and I support the general sentiment that we need to look at our language very, very carefully going forward.  Thank you."
"115";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data confirm that economic activity was growing at a solid pace pre-Katrina, and we appear to have remained on track since then, at least on an ex-hurricane basis.  The direct effects of the storms appear to be limited to the disruption of productive capacity along the Gulf Coast.  Outside of the affected regions, real activity continues to expand, as suggested by the September industrial production report and the third-quarter GDP figures. In our District, there are few signs that this year’s hurricanes have directly affected real economic activity. In fact, we’ve seen a broad pickup in activity since August.  Our October manufacturing survey indicates that shipments, orders, and employment grew at or above the November 1, 2005 39 of 114 September and October, and retail sales increased moderately in both months, as broad sales increases outweighed a drop in auto and light truck sales. Concerns about the macroeconomic effects of these hurricanes obviously center on the significant bulge in energy prices.  The continued growth in nominal consumer spending ex-autos since Katrina is evidence that the effects of energy price increases have not yet dampened household demand, and there seems to be little indication of a hurricane-induced downshift in investment demand either.  So the evidence is consistent with my hypothesis that the hurricanes are essentially a supply disruption with little independent effect on demand, and thus, the real interest rate path should be, if anything, higher than it otherwise would be. A second concern regarding the macroeconomic effects of the hurricanes is the potential for energy prices to pass through to core inflation.  Here the recent news on core prices has been encouraging.  Core PCE inflation came in at 1.3 percent for the third quarter and has averaged 1.5 percent since March, right where I think we would like it to be.  One would expect most of the pass- through to take a couple of months to materialize, however, and in that regard there are several unsettling signs worth noting.  Within the Fifth District, for example, our surveys show a surge in prices paid for both manufacturing and services over the last two months.  Moreover, the average reported rate of increase in prices received in both surveys has accelerated significantly in September and October. Consistent with these quantitative signals, a larger number of our contacts now say they’re able to pass through part or all of their increasing costs to their customers.  In addition, the average rate of price increase our respondents see for six months ahead has also surged, and our index for expected wage increases in manufacturing has skyrocketed to over 56 for October.  This diffusion November 1, 2005 40 of 114 consistent with the anticipation of a fairly broad-based upswing in inflation, although obviously it could just be a false alarm. Another unsettling sign is the recent behavior of TIPS inflation compensation measures. These have drifted up a couple of tenths since June and are now bouncing around in the neighborhood of 2.6. So I think we were right to downgrade inflation expectations from “well contained” to merely “contained” in our last statement, and I think we should view a further erosion of inflation expectations as unwelcome. The extent to which energy price increases pass through to core inflation is fundamentally determined by the public’s expectations regarding future monetary policy.  My sense is that we have just a brief window to head off such pass-through should it threaten.  The Greenbook does foresee significant pass-through, with the core PCE inflation rising to 2.4 percent in the first half of next year and then gradually falling back down to under 2 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to trace out a similar hump-shaped path.  In the face of this outcome, the Greenbook has us raising the funds rate to 4¼ percent in December and then stopping there for a year, at least ¼ point short of where markets expect us to go. I would question the plausibility of this joint outcome.  First, I do not think we would or should stand by while inflation prospects erode as noticeably as they do in the Greenbook.  Nor do I think we could count on inflation expectations to gently drift back down after surging as the Greenbook expects—at least not without forceful action on our part. For today, I’m comfortable with the alternative B statement.  But should more definite signs of pass-through emerge in coming months, we should be prepared to communicate forcefully and convincingly our intention not to accommodate a deterioration in core inflation of the magnitude November 1, 2005 41 of 114"
"116";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh District economy expanded at a somewhat better pace since the last meeting, though it is still lagging the rest of the country. However, for the Chicago economy, particularly the South Side [laughter], it was the best October in 88 years! President Fisher and I had a side wager, but I’ll let him fill you in on the details of that.,  In our contact calls for this round, energy prices were a pervasive concern. So far they’ve had a limited effect on consumer spending, but our contacts worry that high heating bills will take a bigger bite out of sales in the coming months.  In contrast, we’re seeing the impact on costs right now. Nearly every contact reported pressures from higher energy prices.  There are many examples, but here’s one that seemed a bit more surprising than others.  A large specialty November 1, 2005 29 of 114 which is a petroleum derivative.  He said that in 30 years in the furniture business, this is the first time that the stuffing cost more than the fabric or the frame.  [Laughter] Labor markets are also starting to generate cost pressures.  For example, both Manpower and Kelly report signs of tighter labor markets.  These contacts say that many firms, after having been very cautious about hiring, now feel they have pushed productivity growth as far as it can go and, accordingly, finally feel they need to hire more permanent employees, particularly in office jobs. Our contacts see this as a further sign that firms are more confident about demand.  One of the staffing services firms said that they are paying higher wages and also spending more on recruiting and retention bonuses.  And several of our directors report that they’re budgeting larger salary increases for 2006, in the range of one-half to a full percentage point higher than this year. The consensus among our contacts was that only a portion of these higher costs has been passed through to prices, at least so far.  Several reported that labor costs are mostly eating into margins, which is what we’ve been expecting.  But more price increases may be coming.  A home goods retailer noted that they had set their current list prices last spring.  When they decide how to price their products for next year, they’ll take into account the fuel cost outlook at that time. There has been no let-up in the auto industry’s woes.  Our contacts say that higher oil prices seem to have frozen consumers, and showroom traffic is down.  There have been some interesting developments with regard to labor costs in the auto industry.  GM’s recent renegotiation of its health care liabilities, if ratified, would be the UAW’s [United Auto Workers] first major mid-contract give-back in history. Ford and DaimlerChrysler will be demanding similar concessions.  Indeed, it might be that the Delphi bankruptcy has helped the industry at least get the ball rolling on some November 1, 2005 30 of 114 a clear possibility of a strike at Delphi that could seriously disrupt the auto industry, particularly General Motors. For the national outlook, the last six weeks of data have confirmed that the dislocations from Katrina and Rita have had a limited impact on aggregate economic activity.  Outside the areas affected by the hurricanes, labor markets are improving at a pace similar to earlier in the year.  And I’m getting favorable impressions of business sentiment from my contacts, which is a good sign for hiring and capital spending.  However, there is a risk that the recent sluggishness in consumer expenditures and low levels of confidence may be foreshadowing a period of somewhat softer growth in consumption.  Households have further run down savings to maintain spending in the face of higher energy prices, and it’s very difficult to gauge how this might influence consumption going forward. With regard to inflation, the readings on core prices in the last quarter were good.  Given all that I’ve heard in recent weeks, though, it seems likely that past increases in energy and material costs will soon begin to show through more clearly in prices downstream, as is forecast in the Greenbook.  Furthermore, labor markets have tightened.  As I noted, many of my business contacts are planning for larger increases in wages and benefits next year.  They can only absorb these higher costs in margins for so long.  Finally, there’s a chance that increases in costs and prices will result in a meaningful rise in longer-run inflation expectations, which would be a risk to the longer-run Greenbook forecast. All of these risks add up to increasing the funds rate by 25 basis points again today.  Looking ahead, I think we should continue tightening.  At least we are comfortably in the middle of a neutral range, and there’s a possibility we’re going to have to go further.  There’s a good deal of uncertainty November 1, 2005 31 of 114 Bluebook suggests that a 4 percent nominal funds rate might be the midpoint of the range, but I’m personally skeptical that the rate is that low.  This is going to be an important issue for us to consider going forward.  I’m glad that we at least started the discussion earlier today, and I hope we’ll continue it later in the meeting.,  Don’t underestimate it.  [Laughter]"
"117";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparation for today’s meeting, I surveyed the CEOs of three large regional banks in the Southeast, the head of the Bankers’ Bank in Texas, and a banker in Biloxi, Mississippi, hoping primarily to get an idea of the rate of recovery, although to a certain extent to get a reading on the amount of devastation from the storm.  The way to look at it, I think, is to do it in bands going out from the point of the storm where the greatest damage occurred. The banker in Biloxi reminded me—maybe informed me—that although most of the publicity was about New Orleans, the damage to the Mississippi Gulf Coast may have been at least as bad.  I November 1, 2005 69 of 114 is gone from the Alabama coast to the Louisiana border.  They are experiencing at the moment 24 percent unemployment and labor shortages, simultaneously, due to the fact that people can’t stay in the area when they have lost their houses in addition to their jobs.  In his judgment, 25 percent of his customers have left the area.  So some restaurants there are on reduced hours because they do not have the labor to keep them open.  It is this banker’s expectation that it will be five years before the city of Biloxi recovers and that it will recover only because of a change the legislature has granted, allowing the gaming industry to move their operations from offshore barges to on land.  There’s going to be a significant transition in the mix as a result of that.  It is the gaming industry, and more broadly the service industry, on which the recovery will be based. If you go from that immediate band out one more, to the areas not quite as heavily impacted by the storm, you get a completely different picture.  In the estimation of one bank with a significant Alabama presence and a significant Southeast presence, it was about three weeks between the time the storm hit until the banking activity—consumer and commercial loans—was pretty much back to normal.  The remarkable fact, which they hadn’t expected because it was completely different from other hurricane experiences, is that the number of checking accounts—two different banks gave this information—has doubled.  This activity has doubled. Compare that to the Biloxi area where, over the years, hurricanes have generally been good for banking, because what the banks do during the recovery process is recycle or, if you will, intermediate, insurance checks.  That is now happening more broadly throughout the region, but it also suggests that a very significant realignment or redistribution of population is taking place throughout that area. Similar to the experience that President Fisher noted, housing units as far away as Atlanta are November 1, 2005 70 of 114 in size; and it appears, based on the apartment rentals and home purchases, that that is at least semi­ permanent.  More broadly, skilled workers throughout the Southeast are flocking into the storm- impacted areas, the attraction being the difference in wage rates they can receive.  A side implication of that is that construction projects in other parts of the Southeast have been delayed or in some cases postponed, both because of the unavailability of labor and also the increase in prices of building supplies. Pulling it all together, the information I’ve received fairly well corroborates the Greenbook in terms of the impact of the storm—namely, that outside of the most heavily impacted area, economic activity proceeded largely unabated.  And it suggests that we are clearly seeing evidence of price pressures, both in wages and in building materials. That being the case, it does seem that a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate at today’s meeting would be appropriate, describing the rationale for doing it in the language of alternative B.  But I strongly support President Yellen’s suggestion that we look at how we communicate what we do.  Six or eight months ago, when I thought about approaching the point where we were close to a position we would define as equilibrium, I was comfortable that we’d have a clear sense at that time as to where we were going and what I could be looking for. But I don’t.  And I don’t know if that’s consistent with just where we are in the cycle, so the decisions are tougher, or if it’s because we are getting some mixed signals at this point when we are close to a transition. I have heard this morning a very strong indication of the need to guard against inflation and to identify inflationary pressures.  I’ve also heard a very good explanation for the fact that long-term inflationary expectations in particular, as Governor Kohn suggested, are well contained.  But I think we are at the confluence of a number of events, one of which is that we are clearly reaching the November 1, 2005 71 of 114 where the wording of the statement has outlived its usefulness.  And third, we are approaching a transition in leadership.  And I think all of us are aware that while there perhaps have been weaknesses in our communication, and maybe even in our analysis, there has been enormous confidence in our leadership. In my experience, the only time that this body has significantly confused the market is when we have tried to make a change both in our position and our communication simultaneously.  If we add in a transition in leadership, I would hope that if there is any miscommunication it would attach to the communication, not to the transition.  So in my view, December will not be too early to think about the confluence of all of those events.  But for today, I certainly support the 25 basis point increase and the definition of it in alternative B.  Thank you."
"118";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say at the outset—to try to put some organizing structure into my anecdotal reports—that the reports on activity are almost uniformly on the strong side.  And I think the reports on inflation are almost uniformly on the upside rather than November 1, 2005 59 of 114 Let me talk about Wal-Mart first.  Before the hurricanes, let’s say in early August, Wal-Mart was anticipating growth in same-store sales of about 5 percent year-over-year.  So they would have expected October to come in about 5 percent above October of last year.  Once they saw the hurricanes and had other information, including the big spike in energy prices—of course, they believe that energy prices have a major impact on the income available to the people who shop at Wal-Mart—they were expecting October to come in at about 1 percent.  In fact, October same-store sales rose by about 4 percent, excluding gasoline.  So sales were much stronger than they would have anticipated, given the information that they had.  Moreover, they saw a pickup in demand for higher price point items.  In various discretionary categories, such as televisions, for example, more of the higher-priced goods were being sold. I have a contact with a large West Coast software company, and that company is disappointed in the large enterprise segment of its business but is seeing surprising strength in the consumer sector, including a shift in the consumer sector toward more expensive equipment.  The example cited was that in the back-to-school market for the high school and college segments, there were more purchases of laptops, which are more expensive than desktop computers. My contacts in the package-delivery industry are anticipating a very strong holiday season; indeed, they are expecting demand in the peak week prior to Christmas to outrun capacity.  The expectation that they will not have enough capacity in place is due in part to the rapid growth in Internet sales and the home deliveries associated with that.  Also, they pointed to a particularly large unexplained increase in business in the Chicago area recently, both inbound and outbound.  They have no idea why.  I said I would consult with my colleague on the FOMC to see if he has any insight.  So maybe during the coffee break he can tell me what’s going on in Chicago.  I don’t think November 1, 2005 60 of 114,  Another example that I thought was quite interesting was that UPS is actually shifting its over-the-road shipments away from the piggyback rail system to long-distance trucks in order to gain shorter transit time.  My contact said that the railroads are simply unwilling to put the investment into their track and equipment and operating systems to match the delivery times. Obviously, it’s much less fuel-efficient to ship by truck, but the pressure on delivery times was leading UPS to switch its operations in that direction. On the price front, my Wal-Mart contact said that general merchandise prices are still falling a little bit. Food prices have been up about 1½ percent over the last year.  However, Wal-Mart noted that its suppliers—I think this would be primarily domestic suppliers—have indicated that they expect to take some price increases after January 1, although not enough to completely cover their cost increases.  Wal-Mart is not seeing price increases on goods that are sourced abroad, particularly from China of course.  Wal-Mart has continued to absorb increases in transportation costs and utility costs. That’s the story for retailers generally.  It’s obvious that they’re not going to absorb those costs forever, but they have been doing so temporarily.  My Wal-Mart contact also noted that their construction costs for new stores and other facilities are rising in a range of 10 to 15 percent. And in a recent luncheon in St. Louis with local real estate people, house builders, and others in the business, many said that they also see substantial upward pressure on construction costs.  It’s not just the cost of land—or ground, as the homebuilders put it—but materials and labor costs are under substantial upward pressure. One other thing that I thought was interesting came from my contact at UPS, where they’ve just completed—I think the negotiations are completed—negotiations with their pilots.  Apparently November 1, 2005 61 of 114 lump sum.  And I suspect that these lump sum payments will escape inclusion in the ECI measurement, given the way the ECI is put together.  I see Dave Stockton shaking his head.  The other thing that was really quite surprising is that they are paying signing bonuses for new airplane captains of $45,000 to $60,000.  You would think, with all the pilots being released from the passenger airlines, that they wouldn’t have any trouble hiring pilots.  But apparently the strength of the union is such that it has been able to work that deal as part of the settlement.  UPS is anticipating that their pilots, now making $190 per hour, will be up to $223 per hour in 2006.  They will be the highest paid pilots in the industry. The one other thing I would say is that I share the Greenbook forecast, but I do believe that the inflation risks are asymmetric.  It’s much easier for me to imagine a ½ point forecast error with inflation coming in on the high side, rather than the low side, of the point forecast.  I think that’s where I’ll stop now.  Thank you.,   Please don’t.  [Laughter]"
"119";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Third District’s economy continues to expand, with growth moderating toward its potential pace.  After accelerating in the second quarter, employment growth in the region decelerated in the third quarter back toward its first-quarter pace. But unemployment rates remained steady for the three-state region and remained lower than the November 1, 2005 50 of 114 Consumer spending for general merchandise has held steady.  There is some anecdotal evidence that consumers are limiting discretionary spending due to higher energy costs.  And there is some concern among retailers that fourth-quarter sales may come in below plan because of subdued consumer sentiment and higher winter heating bills. Construction continues to be a strong sector for our regional economy.  Housing construction and sales remain strong in the District, and nonresidential construction has been on an improving trend since the beginning of the year—with the usual month-to-month volatility. Regional manufacturing activity accelerated in October.  The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey rebounded sharply from 2.2 in September to 17.3 in October.  The other forward-looking indices in the survey, including those for new orders and shipments, also showed a nice bounce, as did the index of future activity.  Perhaps the improvement in expectations should have been expected, since our September survey was taken in the early days after the Katrina event. Indeed, in response to special questions, half of our firms reported that they had experienced some change in demand or problems related to the Gulf Coast hurricanes.  The changes in demand, some positive and some negative, were generally slight.  Problems relating to obtaining energy and other materials, as well as transportation problems, were characterized as being somewhat more significant.  Despite these problems, our firms did experience an increase in activity last month. Again, the most troubling aspect of our latest survey is the significant increase in price indices. The prices paid index rose sharply in October for the second consecutive month and is at its highest level since 1980.  The prices received index also jumped last month, suggesting that some of the higher-priced inputs are being passed on to consumers.  The core PCE and core CPI share a November 1, 2005 51 of 114 the high-inflation period of the late 1970s and early 1980s, I think these early indications of possible pass-through bear watching. In my view, the national economy seems to be evolving along the lines we had expected at our last meeting.  The economy appears to have weathered the hurricane in reasonably good shape. And, abstracting from those hurricane effects, the economy has retained a good bit of positive momentum.  Of course, uncertainty remains about the magnitude of the hurricane effects, so there’s a wider band of uncertainty around the economic outlook than there was pre-hurricane.  On the negative side, higher winter heating bills could result in significantly slower consumer demand.  But on the positive side, next year’s rebuilding activity could result in a bigger boost to activity than expected. The growth risks seem to be balanced, and these hurricane effects are most likely to be temporary. The bigger risk, in my view, is on the inflation side.  Core inflation remains contained at this point, and empirical studies suggest energy price pass-through to the core has typically been small. Where we’ve gotten into trouble during the earlier energy price shocks is when we’ve let inflation expectations get away from us.  Indeed, the only departure between headline inflation and core CPI inflation as large as the current one occurred during past energy price shocks.  In those cases, accommodative monetary policy resulted in rapid increases in core inflation. We cannot allow inflation expectations to become unanchored, and I don’t believe we will. As the energy infrastructure is rebuilt and energy markets stabilize, much of the run-up in headline inflation should reverse itself, as many people have suggested.  This will help keep inflation and inflation expectations contained.  We’ve already seen a decline in crude oil and gasoline prices.  The latter is particularly welcome, as it could buoy consumer sentiment as we head toward the buying November 1, 2005 52 of 114 Nonetheless, in my view, inflation pressures remain elevated.  So the prudent course of action today is to continue to gradually move rates up nearer to the range of the equilibrium real rate.  As we near that range, our language is going to have to evolve, as a number of us have indicated.  I don’t think today is the day for a major change in language, but I would welcome the discussion that many have suggested we need to have.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"120";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Changes in District economic conditions have been small recently and seemingly largely offset each other.  So the economy overall continues on a positive path. Housing activity, especially the pace of sales, has been slowing recently, although to some extent that is seasonal.  But I think it’s fair to say that overall some of the vigor in housing is in the process of diminishing.  In contrast, commercial real estate development has been picking up modestly and in a number of locations throughout the District, and developers seem more optimistic than they have for some time.  Manufacturing activity is continuing to advance.  The mining and energy industries are operating at high levels of capacity, as you would expect.  And employment is increasing, except at Northwest Airlines. I don’t think the underlying fundamentals of inflation have changed recently, but there are a few more reports in the District of the ability to pass through cost increases—more reports than I had been hearing formerly.  Also, at a meeting of our Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor, there were more reports of products on allocation than I had expected to hear.  While there are ready substitutes for some of these products, for others, like concrete, that’s not quite the case. And that will be, without question, constraining activity relative to what otherwise would have occurred. As far as the national economy is concerned, I don’t have any material disagreement with the Greenbook assessment of the outlook although, if left to my own devices, I might write down a little November 1, 2005 58 of 114 positive momentum to it, as others have observed, and spending associated with recovery from Hurricane Katrina will add to that.  I am also encouraged on balance by the modest reports on core measures of inflation for the last couple of quarters.  So, overall, both the current state of the economy and its prospects look favorable to me.  Core inflation may tick up a bit, as depicted in the Greenbook, but I would expect that to be temporary.  And as far as the risks of stagflation are concerned, while I certainly wouldn’t dismiss that as a possibility—and I would acknowledge that the episode in the mid- and late-1970s initially, as I recall, snuck up on policymakers—it’s hard for me to develop a stagflation scenario without serious monetary policy errors.  And that’s in our power to avoid. Against that background, I would favor another ¼ percentage point increase in the funds rate at this meeting.  I would also endorse the comments of President Yellen about the need to review and make some significant changes to the statement accompanying our decision.  And I think there may be some urgency to that.  One way of viewing that, at least as I’ve been thinking about it, is that if we continue on the path we’re on, we’ll be looking at a nominal federal funds rate of 4½ percent before long and a real rate north of 2 percent.  At that point, are we still going to be willing to talk about removing policy accommodation?  Will we be willing to do it at 4¼?  Today we’ll be at 4 percent, so I don’t think the time is far off when we’re going to have to confront these issues."
"121";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What I’d like to do today is to talk a little bit more about some recent trends in consumer borrowing information, which a few people have already mentioned, and then just make some general comments on the economy and on inflation. As a couple of you have already noted, the data on consumer borrowing have shown a lot of noise, as I would call it, in the last couple months.  Overall, we’re seeing a slowing in the rapid rate of growth.  It’s still growing in general, but the pace of growth is slowing.  So it raises the question of what is really happening here.  Are consumers saying that they are nearing the point at which they really can’t absorb any more debt?  Or are changes in underwriting under way that are slowing the pace of growth? As you know, the Senior Loan Officer Survey, covered in the supplement to the Greenbook, reported only modest changes in demand for credit; it was modestly lower.  And to the extent that November 1, 2005 72 of 114 couple of months, as the big incentives came off.  Also, we’re beginning to see a moderation in the pace of increase in median housing prices.  So that could be consistent with a slowing in demand. On the other hand, if we look at the chart in the Greenbook on bankruptcy filings, there was a huge spike in the week prior to October 17, just before the new bankruptcy law went into effect. And that could have front-loaded anywhere from three to four quarters of bankruptcy filings, as everybody tried to get in before the law changed.  We saw a tremendous increase at that point.  It doesn’t reflect what the banks are showing in the quality of their credit or in the securitized transactions that are out there in the market where delinquency rates have basically been fairly stable. So this was a blip up ahead of what our normal leading indicators are showing. On home equity lines, I find the numbers really remarkable.  Home equity lines grew 31 percent in 2003, 44 percent in 2004, slowed to 17 percent growth in the first half of this year, and now, as Governor Kohn just mentioned, have shown declines in September and October.  So the question is: What is happening with these home equity lines?  As you know, the banking agencies collectively put out common guidance in May regarding home equity lines.  There was really nothing new in this guidance.  It just pulled together what was out there to remind everybody what safe and sound lending practices are.  We know that the vast majority of banks follow these sound procedures in almost all of their lending.  So I felt comforted that in the Senior Loan Officer Survey only a few banks said they had changed their underwriting standards because of the new guidance. That to me says that we did really focus on the outliers, which was our intention.  So I don’t believe that this reining in of home equity lines is due to underwriting changes.  We know that home equity lines have been used not only to extract equity for spending but also increasingly for downpayments on purchases of homes—more so than in the past.  So again, this could reflect something more that November 1, 2005 73 of 114 As you know, the banking agencies later this quarter are going to issue some guidance on mortgages and on loans for commercial real estate.  Again, our intention is not to signal alarm that overall credit quality and underwriting are poor, but to call attention to some lending practices at the limit that are raising some concerns.  So at the margin it could have some impact on the pace of lending, but we think overall things are in pretty good shape. The other point I want to make is about credit card lending.  More than a year ago now, both the OCC [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency] and the Fed started to raise questions about underwriting and credit advances for borrowers who go over their lines of credit and about minimum payments expected on credit card balances.  A growing number of customers were not being required to cover late payment fees or fees for going over their credit line and actually were into negative amortization when their outstanding balances exceeded their lines of credit. We’ve given the banks quite a bit of time to figure out how to get into compliance with these guidelines.  Some started doing so toward the end of last year and some will be doing it later this year; so they are moving at their own pace.  The change in practices will slow credit growth for some clients—the ones who chronically are over their lines and who have paid only the minimum monthly fee.  Again, we don’t expect this to be widespread, but it could be a factor in some of these bankruptcy filings. People who have been at the fringe of being overextended are realizing that they’re going to have to get their borrowings down. Now let me shift my focus to the overall economy.  I find that the pace of the expansion has been quite resilient, given everything that we’ve been through in the past year.  Recently, despite significant difficulties, whether it was hurricanes or the spike in oil prices, growth continued at a November 1, 2005 74 of 114 Inflation has slowed in the last couple of months, but I’ve focused a bit on the nature of the developments there.  As you know, some of the slowdown has been in prices of services.  And with some of the trends we’re seeing in core elements of inflation, getting a number over 2 percent, as the forecast has, begins to give me some concern.  So I look at that and at the forecast for a continued rise in labor compensation costs. A potential slowdown in productivity also suggests that we need to be much more attentive to what’s going on in terms of cost pressures on the labor front that could affect workers’ expectations of compensation increases.  So I think it’s even more important for us to watch inflation in the next few months. I support raising the funds rate today.  I also support the dialogue, as President Yellen outlined, on the elements of our communication so that we have an orderly transition.  We ought to look carefully at every word in our statement.  While it will be parsed when we make changes, at least all of us will have had some time to think about the changes.  And I would hope that we have that dialogue at our next meeting."
"122";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in New England have bounced around a little bit over the last year or so.  Right now they show a few signs of flattening out.  Surveys of both consumer and business confidence show some current strength, but opinions about activity six months from now either remain at a low level in the case of consumers or, for businesses, turned negative for the first time in the last five years. Worries about fuel and benefits costs, interest rate increases, and the war in Iraq are most often mentioned by contacts as shaping a less-than-rosy outlook.  And when you talk to them about big profit margins, they look at you with a puzzled expression, wondering what business you are talking about because that’s certainly not the case for their business.  I think there’s some difference of opinion when looking at your own numbers versus the numbers in the aggregate. Anyway, for the present, most firms do report profits, with those serving the defense industry making notable headway.  Consumers are spending, if not on cars then on housing, though at least according to one survey they perceive rising pressures on their personal finances.  And core inflation in the Boston area is surprisingly low relative to the nation.  It’s usually higher.  Thus, there’s a sense in which the region may be experiencing a period of calm before a possible storm of negative trends. Employment in the region dropped in September, and the unemployment rate rose.  The employment decline was widespread by state and involved, in part, the usual suspects of trade and manufacturing, but about half reflected government workers in Maine.  September government employment can move around a lot, depending on the hiring of teachers for kindergarten through November 1, 2005 42 of 114 report that skilled labor is hard to find and expensive.  There are continuing references to caution in hiring and a desire not to add a single new employee until it’s necessary to do so. Both businesses and consumers are concerned about the impact of high heating oil, natural gas, and gasoline prices.  Local heating oil companies that have provided lock-in rates for the winter in the past will not do so now, likely feeding into concerns.  Despite many fervent prayers for the opposite, the winter is expected to be a bad one.  And that forecast was underlined by the early snowfalls in northern New England a couple weeks ago and by the flurries in Massachusetts over the weekend. Certainly this is good in terms of prospects for skiing revenues, but not so good for general optimism, given concerns about energy. Finally, let me say a word about residential real estate markets.  The Boston area is often mentioned as having bubble-like characteristics.  This is an obvious concern, given the problems the region experienced with falling prices and related banking failures in the early ’90s.  However, there’s good reason to assume that recent rising prices in New England reflect a lack of supply and an older, wealthier population capable of supporting both a primary and a secondary residence, rather than a fundamentally unstable situation.  And some of the froth is fading.  Home prices continue to escalate but are currently increasing at about the same pace as in the nation as a whole rather than leading it.  Four out of the eight other regions of the country are now experiencing more rapid escalation. Contacts in the real estate industry report two trends.  First, there was a rather abrupt softening in the high-end suburban markets this summer, with escalating supply and the advent of a buyer’s market—something not seen in several years.  The other trend is an increase in the supply of multifamily units, particularly condominiums, and a marked upturn in condo inventory.  Thus, most November 1, 2005 43 of 114 much of the change at the high end.  This could feed into some concerns about spending in the future and could certainly make people feel less wealthy.  But given where it seems to be centered, it doesn’t appear likely to do a lot of near-term damage. Turning to the national scene, incoming data appear to confirm the underlying strength of the U.S. economy. Separating out the impact of several hurricanes is not easy.  Readings on unemployment and business spending net of hurricane effects seem consistent with the continuation of solid growth through the remainder of 2005.  The strength of consumer outlays remains a question, given the now 2-month downturn in confidence and the fact that the outsized motor vehicle purchases that had supported such outlays in the third quarter are falling off their highs. However, labor market data seem consistent with continued strength in hiring.  One would suppose that, at least in the near term, working consumers will be spending consumers, especially if confidence improves in the face of waning energy prices—or at least prices for gasoline.  Finally, I take the continued strength in housing as a sign that, under it all, consumers still have the confidence to make rather long-term investments. Our forecast in Boston for the next year and into ’07 differs little from the Greenbook’s. Assuming energy prices subside, or at a minimum that we don’t have any new shocks, growth should pick up in the spring, as the impact of the energy tax on consumers eases and as rebuilding in hurricane-ravaged areas accelerates.  Over the same 6-month or so period through the winter into spring, low inventory levels are likely to be replenished, feeding factory activity.  Growth outside the United States is, on balance, expected to be positive as well.  Employment growth should return to its pre-Katrina monthly pace, and the remaining slack in the U.S. economy should wane.  The post-Katrina “throw money at it” attitude in Washington seems to have moderated, but a fiscal November 1, 2005 44 of 114 The worrisome headline numbers on both the CPI and the PCE moderate; the feed-through to core inflation ticks up but then moderates through the year; and this process pulls in on the upward trajectory of near-term inflation expectations. There are obvious risks here.  Energy-based headline inflation could feed more strongly into the core, and inflation expectations could remain elevated.  We could see the moderate trends in wage and salary growth, as measured by the ECI, begin to take off.  However, I’m hopeful, along the same lines that President Yellen is, that inflation expectations will moderate, as gasoline prices have, and that we won’t see even as big a feed-through to the ECI data as the Greenbook projects. However, if a big rise in wages were to occur, it would set red lights flashing on everybody’s economic dashboard. If we are lucky, our rather benign forecast for the next year will work out.  If we’re not, we could be looking at both rising inflation and falling growth, as one of the alternative scenarios highlights.  In that regard, we need to pay careful attention to incoming data on expectations, compensation, and core inflation.  If they’re blinking yellow or green, we may be on track.  If red predominates, the risks have clearly escalated. It certainly seems clear that managing such risks in the near term involves placing a premium on remaining credible regarding inflation.  Doing so should moderate price growth by tightening financial conditions and should result in better pricing of risk.  It should also convince consumers that inflation will not continue to exacerbate the growing strain on their pocketbooks.  It should moderate inflation expectations and limit the feed-through into wage and salary growth. But we also need to take care not to overdo.  There are downside risks.  With a small amount of additional tightening in the mix, the Greenbook sees growth at below potential in late ’06, a November 1, 2005 45 of 114 slowing in real estate markets and a decline in relative household wealth.  The related expected rise in personal saving may be just what the doctor ordered to start the process of reining in the excesses in the U.S. economy, but I think we do need to take care about dispensing excessive amounts of inflation medicine. In my view, we’re not at a tipping point as yet.  Our process of measured steps toward removing the remaining accommodation should continue for a time, taking us closer to the middle of the range of equilibrium rates.  But we should also begin to consider when we might have moved enough and how we might prepare markets for that.  In that regard, I was interested in the proposal that President Yellen had for an evolution in our statement.  I think it’s going to take some time to absorb what she has recommended.  Maybe this meeting is not the meeting to make a change.  I’m probably comfortable with alternative B.  A couple of meetings ago, the Chairman suggested that I take on the task—because I was opening my mouth at the time—of putting some proposals on the table, and I’ve been dragging my heels.  I’m more than happy to work with President Yellen on the direction she’s trying to take the statement.  Thank you."
"123";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The worst position for a central banker to be in is depicted in the Greenbook’s stagflation scenario.  I don’t think we’re headed there, but just knowing that it has a nontrivial probability is somewhat disturbing.  And indeed, I’ve started to get questions from business people in the Fourth District on whether I’m concerned about stagflation. With that possibility in mind, I’d like to speak first about the real economy and then make a few comments about inflation.  During this intermeeting period, I’ve had a number of conversations with directors, obviously, but we’ve also held several economic forums and business advisory council meetings. From these conversations, I’ve concluded that the business conditions in the Fourth District are mixed. First, I’ll comment on the positive news.  Steel producers report that sales in most product lines are doing very well.  Commercial construction activity in the District picked up recently, albeit from a relatively low level.  Trucking and shipping firms continue to report that business is brisk November 1, 2005 55 of 114 planning to step up their capital spending next year, and investments—in foreign operations especially—continue unabated. Now for the not-so-positive news.  The problems in the automobile industry appear to be deepening, as signified by the Delphi bankruptcy filing.  Ford, GM, and a host of their suppliers are concentrated in my District, and their restructuring activities are almost certainly going to be a drag on regional growth for a while.  In fact, there appear to be a lot of mergers, acquisitions, and restructurings taking place in the manufacturing sector, as was pointed out by President Moskow. Certainly, the companies that rely heavily on natural gas and petrochemical feedstocks are facing severe margin pressures.  One of my directors from a large multinational chemical company reports that the U.S. coatings industry is becoming globally uncompetitive due to the price and availability of natural gas in the United States. Moreover, as others have mentioned, many business leaders are quite anxious about the impact of home heating bills in the coming months on consumer spending.  Some retailers are being especially cautious about their inventories, and companies further down the supply chain tell me that they can quickly pull back capital spending projects if the need arises. Although the comments that I’ve been hearing about the real economy vary a lot by industry, I hear a much more consistent commentary when it comes to the pricing environment.  Everyone I’ve spoken with is worried about the effects of higher energy prices and pricing psychology more generally.  It’s a fact that energy and other input costs have been rising.  Some of these costs are now being passed through successfully, and I’m concerned that the climate has become more receptive to pass-through than at any time in recent memory. One of my directors reported that she has been trying unsuccessfully to raise prices to a November 1, 2005 56 of 114 he knew she was going to have to raise prices in this environment and he was just hoping to get a heads-up on how much those price increases would be and when they would come.  What that customer had previously regarded as unacceptable was now acknowledged as inevitable.  An executive of a software company that specializes in solutions to steel companies told me that he is increasing his prices because his customers are finally making plenty of money, so they’re now willing to accept his price increases.  To paraphrase him and others: “Now that the train is leaving the station, you’d better get on with as much luggage as you can carry.”  [Laughter] Shortages of some raw materials are also likely to add price pressures in coming months. Several people reported that their suppliers are invoking force majeure clauses in contracts.  Their suppliers are facing shortages of some raw materials, preventing them from meeting their contract obligations.  These people tell me that they’ve not encountered such circumstances in 30 years of doing business, and they are concerned about where prices are headed. I’ve not been as alarmed about inflationary pressures as my business contacts because core measures have been very favorable.  And I expect the headline numbers to improve next year.  But I can’t refrain from noting something about the policy environment that’s implied by the Greenbook baseline projection.  An awkward feature of that projection is the trajectory of the headline and core inflation measures in 2006.  After telling the public that they should ignore headline numbers and pay attention instead to core inflation statistics, this Committee would be holding the fed funds rate steady during a year in which labor costs and core price measures are expected to accelerate from their current pace.  This might indeed be the correct policy, but it might appear to the public that we are tolerating a rise in core inflation.  Such a situation could pose some additional communication November 1, 2005 57 of 114 communicate these issues.  But for today, I believe the appropriate action for us is to continue to remove our policy accommodation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"124";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meeting I was optimistic that we would avoid a brush with stagflation despite the higher energy prices and the setback in production November 1, 2005 35 of 114 optimistic view.  Although considerable uncertainty still clouds the outlook, I regard reports on both real economic activity and inflation to be generally encouraging. On the real side, it now appears more likely that the disruptions caused by the hurricanes will be transitory.  Oil and wholesale gasoline prices, for example, have fallen below their August levels before Katrina.  Furthermore, rebuilding has been gathering steam quickly, and spending outside of the Gulf region remains robust.  In the Greenbook, the effect of this encouraging news about the underlying vigor of the economy has been held in check by the assumption of tighter financial conditions, so the path for GDP is little revised. With respect to the prospects for inflation, I remain more optimistic than the baseline Greenbook projection.  David suggested in his remarks that it was possible to make a case for inflation doing better than the Greenbook projection, and I will pursue that case now.  Certainly, the latest data have been favorable.  Over the six months ending in September, the core CPI increased only 1.3 percent at an annual rate, while the core PCE price index was up 1.5 percent.  These data raise the question: Where is the energy price pass-through?  PCE energy prices have been rising at double digit rates for more than a year, but they have left remarkably little imprint on core inflation. At our last meeting, I described some econometric evidence showing that since the early 1980s, changes in real oil prices have not had an appreciable effect on core inflation.  Today I thought I would cite some reports from our business contacts that appear to be generally in line with this result. They do note that there has been some success in passing energy cost increases down the supply chain but, given competitive pressures and the lack of pricing power, they tell us that the buck usually stops before the consumer. I thought I would give you an example inspired by the season.  A large pumpkin grower/ November 1, 2005 36 of 114 materials.  She reports that she can pass these costs on to the small retailers she serves, but they are not able to charge consumers more for retail pumpkin products.  So this Thanksgiving you need not worry about paying more for your pumpkin pies.  Obviously, forecasting beyond that is hazardous, but looking out toward Christmas, I thought I would note that one of the country’s largest growers of poinsettias is on our Advisory Council, and he is highly confident that there will be little pass- through of energy costs into retail poinsettia prices.  [Laughter] Also in contrast to the Greenbook, I see no significant pressure for higher inflation coming from increased inflation expectations.  In particular, despite the surge in energy costs this year, current estimates of inflation compensation, both over the next five years and the subsequent five- year period, remain at the same average level that prevailed during the first half of this year.  A further sign that inflation expectations remain well contained can be found in the continued subdued growth of wages and salaries.  Last Friday’s reading on the ECI [Employment Cost Index] I thought revealed no evidence of any pass-through of higher headline inflation or higher inflation expectations to labor compensation.  So I see no indication of the ’70s style wage-price spiral in the offing. Overall, I judge our credibility to be very much intact.  Of course, our credibility going forward does depend on continued vigilance.  The economy now appears to be close to full employment, with a good deal of momentum.  And annual core inflation, at least as judged by the core PCE measure, remains near the upper end of my comfort zone and, arguably, inflation risks are tilted somewhat to the upside.  So with respect to policy, I support at a minimum the removal of any remaining policy accommodation.  The Bluebook shows that the funds rate has finally entered a November 1, 2005 37 of 114 comfortable with a policy position toward the center of this zone.  So a few more increases, including one today, seem to me likely to be required. In implementing monetary policy, it seems to me that actions matter, but so do words, and I wanted to briefly open up the question of the statement.  I think for today the words of alternative B should suffice, but Vincent has repeatedly suggested, and a number of you have emphasized, that we need to consider how to modify the statement language.  Several elements of this statement have expiration dates that are quickly approaching.  So I think it’s an important issue for us to discuss. As we go forward, I see three problems with using the kind of language that is in alternative B. First, it refers to policy accommodation, which will arguably soon be exhausted.  Second, it refers to a “measured pace,” when at some point presumably we will reach a stopping point in this tightening cycle.  And, third, it now contains a near-tautological balance of risk statement that I think serves no obvious policy purpose.  Of course, these three problems could be fixed at different meetings.  For example, if the inflation picture sours, the “measured pace” language could continue to be used well past the elimination of the policy accommodation phrase.  As Governor Gramlich feared, the balance of risk statements could outlive us all!  [Laughter] Still, trying to fix all of these three problems at once has some appeal, and I thought that alternative C did just that.  It eliminates the balance of risk statement and the policy accommodation language; and it substitutes a new forward-looking policy statement for the “measured pace” phrasing. My main criticism of alternative C is that it jettisons any mention of the conditionality of our actions on future data, and I believe such conditionality is always worth highlighting and particularly deserving of emphasis now, toward the end of our tightening cycle. I believe that a good model for future statements would have three sections: a policy decision, November 1, 2005 38 of 114 be nuanced—tailored to prevailing circumstances and explicitly conditional—and it should not include a formulaic balance of risk statement.  Let me give a concrete example based on alternative C. If the Committee believes, for example, that further tightening remains necessary once policy is no longer accommodative, it could state, following the rationale section, that “under these conditions the Committee perceives that further policy firming is likely to be necessary,” or “will be necessary,” or “might be necessary.”  “Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in economic prospects to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability and foster sustainable growth.” Once the Committee feels that further tightening is not necessary, it could state that “under these conditions the Committee perceives that the current stance of monetary policy will likely remain appropriate going forward.  Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to any changes in economic prospects, and so forth, to fulfill its obligations.”  In any case, I hope that this proposal might be useful in jump-starting our discussion of these issues."
"125";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20051101meeting.csv";"  We view the balance of developments since the last meeting as strengthening the case for further firming of monetary policy.  The underlying pace of demand growth seems reasonably strong—a bit stronger than we thought at our last meeting.  The inflation outlook to us looks largely the same as it did in September, with the expected path of core inflation higher than we would like and some risk of further acceleration. On the assumption that we increase the fed funds rate on the higher trajectory now priced into November 1, 2005 62 of 114 potential in ’06—somewhere between 3 and 3.5 percent—and for the rate of increase in the core PCE to stay in the vicinity of 2 percent.  Of course, this has to be considered an implausibly benign view of the world [laughter] and the expansion still faces a familiar array of risks.  But we don’t see evidence yet of a substantial slowdown in demand nor of a troubling acceleration in underlying inflation. The balance of risks in this forecast has changed a bit.  I’m a little less concerned that the cumulative rise in energy prices will itself bring about a more substantial and extended slowdown in growth, although that obviously has to remain a concern and possibly the principal risk to the growth outlook. We believe that the modest expected tightening of financial conditions will have less of a dampening effect on demand growth than the Greenbook assumes.  We don’t see strong evidence yet of a significant deceleration in housing price appreciation or expectations of that outcome in household spending behavior, although both would be desirable.  The evidence of strong stability in the growth of household consumption is, in a sense, borrowing against a future cushion, and that perhaps raises the probability of a more adverse path to future consumption.  But it’s not here yet. As in September, the relative probabilities of alternative inflation outcomes still seem slightly skewed to the upside, thus probably justifying more cumulative firming in monetary conditions. Core PCE has remained moderate, compensation growth modest, productivity growth strong, and long-term inflation expectations reassuringly low.  But the size of the rise in headline inflation and the deterioration in near-term expectations creates the possibility of some further drift up in underlying inflation if, as we expect, the labor market firms further and unit labor costs eventually start to rise more rapidly.  We’re seeing some drift upward in core inflation outside of the United November 1, 2005 63 of 114 On balance, to us this suggests we need to make sure that the market remains confident we’ll do enough to bring inflation and inflation expectations down over the next two years.  To put it differently, we should make sure that we take out enough insurance to avoid a more adverse inflation outcome, and in this sense we should be pleased that the market has raised its estimate of the terminal fed funds rate to around 4½ percent.  Our statement today, I believe, should be designed to be neutral to those expectations, rather than to raise or lower the expected path. I do think it would be helpful if the minutes reflected some discussion today about the approaching need—the approaching need, not the need today—for some changes in the structure of the statement. We’ve been very fortunate to date in how well we have managed this transition in monetary policy, with the market expecting a sustained period of tightening but its expectation of the terminal fed funds rate varying with changes in the outlook.   Our decision to put a soft, qualified, conditional ceiling on the fed funds rate path at 25 basis points a meeting has not cost us to date any erosion in long-term credibility, though it probably has encouraged the market’s investors to take more duration risk.  The remarkable stability in quarterly GDP growth and in core inflation we’ve seen has tended to reinforce expectations about the outlook for monetary policy, adding an unusual degree of certainty about the likely path of the fed funds rate. This has to change.  As we become less certain about the path ahead, that increase in uncertainty needs to get built into market expectations.  The question is when and how we alter our statement to reflect this.  So far, the dominant strategy before us has been to keep moving 25 basis points, to signal that we will continue to do so, and to defer any major changes to the structure of the statement until we are confident we have made our last move.  Now, this may turn out to be the optimal choice, but the language feels increasingly stale.  And it may be better, in fact, to change the November 1, 2005 64 of 114 might make the transition ahead more gentle.  It would give us more than one shot at recalibrating the signal, and it might help bring the market’s uncertainty about what’s ahead more in line with our own. There are two areas where changes in the statement seem indicated.  The first is in how we characterize the rationale for our action.  There we have some room to become more explicit about our view of the outlook relative to our objectives without going all the way to a fully articulated, quantitative forecast. The second, of course, is in the end of the statement.  If the world in December looks about how it looks now, with a high probability of one or more moves still ahead of us, we could, for example, replace the last three sentences of the statement with two which state our views more simply.  They would state first that the outlook for growth and inflation suggests that further monetary policy firming is likely to be necessary, and, second, that the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability so as to achieve sustainable growth. This would get us out of some of the risks of repeating “measured” going forward.  It would help address some of the problems in using the word “accommodation” to signal tightening.  And it would eliminate the awkwardness in the superfluous balance of risk sentence we now have.  This would allow an easy evolution to a more neutral signal when that becomes appropriate—with a simple statement that policy is now roughly appropriate but that we will act as necessary to achieve our objectives going forward. Of course, the world may look different in December, and we have to assess then what makes the most sense.  I don’t know that we can say with confidence today that evolution in December is ideal or necessary, but I think we need to prepare ourselves and the markets for some evolution.

"126";"CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Any further questions?  If not, before we do the roundtable, let me reiterate something that I think has been communicated—namely, that Brian is going to discuss in some detail some of the back and forth that has been occurring here in recent days on the language of the statement. So please abstain from commenting on the statement in the first round until Brian has made his comments.  Given that, have I discouraged anybody?  [Laughter]  President Moskow.,   President Guynn.,  President Fisher.,  President Yellen.,   President Minehan.,   President Lacker.,  President Pianalto.,   Why don’t we break for coffee at this time and come back in fifteen minutes.

"127";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The concept of the known unknown came to the national consciousness about a year or two ago, and I sense that it’s very much in this room today. The baseline forecast calls for a very nice, soft landing to potential growth with contained inflation if we just tighten our policy one or two more turns.  I’m certainly prepared to accept that forecast for the purpose of today’s meeting, but the uncertainties or the known-unknown factors around it are to me quite obvious.  To me the risks are clearly to the upside with respect to growth, but surprisingly may be more balanced with respect to inflation. It is easier to see an upside growth risk than a downside one, in large part because the incoming data have been surprisingly robust, making a slowing just a quarter or two away seem a little bit of a stretch.  Much of the waning wealth effect on which the baseline is built is due to a slowing in the housing market.  It is true that some of the indicators suggest some moderation there, December 13, 2005 56 of 100 when lined up against the actual strength shown in home sales themselves, both existing and new— and also prices, which have continued to appreciate at a double-digit pace through the third quarter— it is hard to say that the housing market is anything but robust. A second element of the wealth effect that the Greenbook assumes is that the equity price appreciation will be no more than needed to keep the current level of the equity risk premium about stable.  But again, it is easy to see some upside potential here.  The equity risk premium is now above average.  The recent run-up in equity prices, coupled with sustained high levels of productivity growth, an attractive profits outlook, and healthy corporate balance sheets all make it perhaps a little more likely that equity prices will rise rather than fall, and indeed, rise more than expected.  If this were to occur, the earnings-price ratio would decline and the equity risk premium would return to the normal range, and in doing so would provide more equity wealth impetus to the economy than perhaps the baseline assumes. Finally, global growth is a surprise to the upside.  As Dino indicated, equity prices have shown remarkable strength globally.  Monetary policy itself has in many cases been somewhat stimulative and generally financial conditions have been supportive of growth.  All of this suggests a bias toward faster global growth due to accommodative financial markets broadly. On inflation, I judge that the risks to the baseline forecast are perhaps a little better balanced. While the upside growth risk would certainly pressure resources with inflationary consequences, that is not the entire story.  For one thing, inflation has come in a little softer recently than we had expected. Secondly, energy prices seem to have flattened, and market participants expect them to moderate even further, providing a rapid diminution of the upward momentum to headline inflation. December 13, 2005 57 of 100 pass-through has been relatively low.  Finally and importantly, longer-term inflation expectations are moderate. I would also add in this regard something that has not been much discussed here: Labor compensation itself has been on the weaker side, even as resource utilization has tightened.  And finally, the productivity growth story, I think, has shown continued robustness.  In this regard I’d point out that we talk a great deal about the upward adjustment to the structural productivity growth in the staff forecast, but all they’ve really done is just to maintain what has happened from 2001 to 2004. So maybe we’ve put too much weight on the temporary downward movement as opposed to just recognizing that things haven’t changed very much. So given this view of the risks around the forecast, why do I propose that we accept the baseline for purposes of today’s decision and communication?  First, I am mindful that policy works with long and variable lags.  While the risks for us are not totally balanced, the greater weight of the evidence, I think, is still for a good outcome, given that we have moved rates up quite considerably. And with inflation expectations still well contained, I think there’s no reason to adjust market perceptions of what we’re likely to do going forward.  If those two facts did not adhere, my judgment might be different. Secondly, one would have to say that while the housing sector story is yet to come, there are, as we’ve heard around this table, a large number of anecdotes all pushing primarily in the same direction—supporting, I would think, the baseline. Third, I take some comfort in the fact that the baseline forecast is shared roughly by most outside forecasters.  The Greenbook does not seem to be out of the trend.  The Blue Chip consensus is that after more than two years of above-trend growth, activity in 2006 is likely to moderate to its trend December 13, 2005 58 of 100 underlie the Blue Chip are not distinguishable dramatically from the Greenbook forecast.  President Moskow has already talked about what happened in Chicago at their outlook symposium.  Again, the consensus seems quite consistent with our forecast from the staff.  And the NABE members we met with in this room not too long ago also expect growth to be in the range of 3.25 to 3.5 in 2006. Finally, I am willing to take the baseline as the basis for policy today because I recognize that our language will convey the proper sense of caution to reflect the risks and leave us with the flexibility to respond to other changes.  I will delay any further comment on that, as you have suggested, until the second part of our discussion."
"128";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, Texas and the Eleventh District are even more surprisingly strong than the surprisingly strong rest of the United States.  We see growth in retail sales and manufacturing employment, strength in housing starts, and high occupancy rates.  Houston is 100 percent occupied in terms of apartments, as part of the resultant fallout from President Guynn’s District.  In every single dimension, the Eleventh District economy is solid. There is price seepage from natural gas and other products.  The most alarming will be utility bills, which are expected to jump by 40 percent next year.  But what is taken from Peter often goes into Paul’s pocket or, as we say, what is taken from Pedro goes into Pablo’s pockets in Texas.  And the best example I can give you is from the CEO of American Airlines, who told me yesterday that their fuel bill over the last two years has increased $3 billion.  As he put it, “The blood is being sucked out of me, and it’s going to our friends down the street.”  In this instance, that is literally the case because Exxon is a couple of blocks away down the street.  In terms of our local economy, this is healthy for us because we’re energy neutral.  In the activity surrounding energy, the rig count is up 23 percent this year.  Energy company profits are soaring, as I referred to earlier.  Oil royalty streams and mineral rights holdings are expected to rise dramatically, so we have a wash as far as energy prices are concerned.  The bottom line is that Texas is a very happy place, the Eleventh District is a very December 13, 2005 33 of 100 Nationally, both the Greenbook and anecdotal evidence indicate that the economy is equally solid. We see it in the retail sales data, as David reported today.  But one of the aspects of those retail sales numbers, according to our interlocutors at the big box distributors, is that less than half the goods sold in what they call the “November frenzy” were deeply discounted goods.  In other words, the sales were solid. I spoke to sixteen CEOs and CFOs in preparing for today.  I basically heard only one new concern, Mr. Chairman, which goes back to the point that Karen was making earlier about globalization.  Also, I want to point out that one of the big homebuilders—Hovnanian—confirmed what you said, David.  As he put it: Investors—meaning speculators—are exiting the business and it is returning to normal.  But the common concern coming from the retailers, the rails, the shippers, the shipbuilders, and so on, was the following:  Everyone I’ve talked to continues to try to figure out ways to exploit globalization.  Each of them, from the IT [information technology] guys to the big box retailers to the specialty chemical firms to the service firms, wants to have offshore supply.  One of the CEOs said, “We have a long way to go in exploiting China.”  We’ve heard that forever.  And one of my favorites was the comment, “China, India, and Indonesia can make Italian ceramics better than Italians can now or could 200 years ago.”  [Laughter] The problem that I’m beginning to hear seeping into the conversation, Mr. Chairman, has to do with U.S. infrastructure.  If you read the New York Times article two days ago about Shanghai’s new deep water port, you have to realize that those facilities are being built to ship goods out of China, not so much to ship goods into China.  And consider this, as reported by one of the shippers I spoke with: 50 percent of all the ships on order for construction are container ships.  Capacity- expanding container business is increasing at 15 percent or more per annum to carry cargo from December 13, 2005 34 of 100 Now, this is good news on the disinflationary front.  As the CEO of Northern Navigation, one of the larger shippers told me, “Transportation by ship will essentially be free when these numbers are realized in the marketplace.”  The bad news is stateside.  We don’t have the capacity to absorb it. Long Beach and the Northwest harbors are constrained.  Work rules, according to our interlocutors, are very slow to adjust.  But there are ways to beat the bottlenecks, and I just want to mention two. UPS reports that they have gone from 6 to 18—and now for next year 21—flights from China.  Wal- Mart just built a four million square foot warehouse in the Houston port, in order to shift part of the burden from Long Beach.  But it is evident that the enemy is us as far as exploiting globalization, and I think that’s a long-term problem that we might want to take note of over time. Presently, I argue that the economy is solid.  We have very good growth.  I’m still a little worried about inflation, but I’m convinced that we’re nipping it in the bud by the action of the FOMC and that we might want to pause sooner rather than later.  But, again, we might discuss that in the discussion of the statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"129";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, let me share a few thoughts on what we’re seeing in our Southeast region.  Overall, growth in our District continues at an acceptable pace, with most of the data and most of the anecdotal reports from directors and other contacts being positive across almost all sectors. Recovery from the hurricanes is proceeding about as we expected, although it’s hard to track all related economic activity, as many residents are still living in—and many businesses still operating from—the new cities to which they fled.  Businesses in the affected areas that are open are now reporting brisk sales of autos and clothing, as belongings destroyed by the storm are replaced. Economic activity for major rebuilding and replacement of housing-related durables has not really started in any significant way.  And if there is any new realization about the timing of that, it is that the rebuilding process—and consequently the economic impact—will be considerably more protracted than I first thought.  It will probably be a process of five years or more.  Almost half of electricity and telephone customers in the area still have not had those services restored. Since we last met, there have also been more and more frequent reports of a definite chill in the residential construction activity and speculation in the frenzied coastal real estate markets.  While that is yet to show through in any convincing way in regional and national statistics, those reports of a measurable shift in attitude and activity are coming from lenders, developers, and real estate December 13, 2005 31 of 100 Perhaps most relevant to the near-term policy considerations, we’re still getting numerous reports of price pressures and determination to try to relieve those pressures by passing through the added costs.  At our meetings last week, two directors from large national companies described what they characterized as new windows of opportunity to get price increases—windows they have already jumped through and gotten significant price increases that are sticking.  They reported that even their tough customers, like the Wal-Marts of the world, had accepted those increases.  It was also reported that while regular gasoline prices have come down, prices of diesel fuel had declined relatively less. And while some rollback of fuel surcharges may be occurring, that is not yet evident. Finally, on a regional level, early holiday sales are reported to be satisfactory.  And our director who is chief financial officer of UPS reported that deliveries are running above plan at this point. Yet there is a realization that tracking total holiday sales may be more difficult than ever, as consumers shift their buying patterns from traditional, more easily measurable stores to a larger use of the Internet for purchases. I also find the new information since our last meeting on the national front encouraging.  The latest numbers on third-quarter GDP were a bit better than I expected and describe what I, too, would characterize as a solid expansion.  We seem to have good balance across sectors.  While it’s reasonable to expect some marginal change in the mix of activity as we move into next year, I expect more of the same in 2006. While the significant fallback in oil prices from their recent highs, the continuing strong competitive pressures, and the robust productivity gains have all worked to constrain inflationary pressures, it’s my judgment that we could still see a rise in inflation as businesses continue to try to recoup their higher input costs.  And leaning against those potential pressures should be our priority, December 13, 2005 32 of 100 Against that backdrop, I would argue that by some measures our current policy setting, at least going into this meeting, is still accommodative.  And whether we choose to describe it as such in our statement, I favor staying on our policy path at least a bit longer.  I think I look forward to our later discussion of what the statement should say.  [Laughter]   Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"130";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d describe the outlook for the U.S. economy as solid, as the Greenbook has described it.  Obviously, several factors contribute to this, including the forward momentum that’s in the economy, the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation (which we’ve talked about in the past), very supportive financial conditions, and stimulative fiscal policy. I would say that the evidence from the Tenth District is consistent with this broader outlook as well, but we also are seeing some slowing in certain areas.  Energy activity in our area continues to expand at a very substantial pace.  There is still a shortage of workers to support some of the expansion that’s being sought.  Manufacturers remain upbeat about future activity and plan increases in capital spending over the next six months.  In addition, consumer spending, after dropping following the hurricanes, has rebounded solidly in our region.  However, there is the point that David mentioned about housing activity, which does appear to be leveling off in our region.  And while manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is at a somewhat slower pace.  I would make note of the fact that we also are being affected by some of the GM issues, since GM is closing its plant in Oklahoma City and that will idle about 2,400 workers. Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be in the area of 2.3 percent next year, as higher energy prices pass through to higher overall core inflation and as the effects of our past accommodative policy show through.  However, I expect that the increases may be temporary, as productivity growth remains strong and as energy prices recede from where they have been, if that continues. Nevertheless, I still would expect the inflation number to be in the 2 percent or slightly December 13, 2005 30 of 100 But that said, I think there continues to be a good case for further tightening at today’s meeting.  Beyond that, I would say it is less certain, as Michael said, and I think in our statement the matter should be couched in the near term.  And I’ll stop there as well.  Thank you."
"131";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The news over the intermeeting period has suggested some shift in the nature of the inflation risks faced by the economy.  Low and stable core December 13, 2005 53 of 100 of inflation expectations seem to imply a reduced threat from near-term feed-through of energy prices to expectations or to core inflation. At the same time, however, information on output and demand indicate that the economy remains on a growth track which is expanding a little more quickly than potential supply.  And this is a trajectory that would increase pressure on resources at a time when those resources are already being fairly well employed. The reasons for the greater-than-expected momentum in output are unclear.  Some of the strength may represent a more muted response to hurricane disruptions or energy prices than anticipated, but much would seem to be related to underlying strength in aggregate demand.  The upward surprises in demand in the third quarter were global, not just in the United States. Increases in industrial commodity prices and sizable gains in equity prices around the world evidence widespread economic strength and expectations that it will persist. Added demand and rising equity prices have provoked little, if any, offsetting tightening in financial conditions in credit markets.  Long-term interest rates globally were little changed on balance over the intermeeting period, and risk spreads out the yield curve and across risk categories continue to be low, reflecting the basically optimistic outlook of investors. Perhaps the resilience of the global economy to oil price increases and persistent expansion in global GDP, including in such laggards as Japan, are slowly increasing the confidence of non- financial businesses as well.  In the United States, the growth of business investment has come into line with past relationships with the cost of capital and changes in output, though the level of investment still remains a bit lower than might be expected. As a consequence of this strength, one question is whether the current constellation of interest rates and asset prices, including expectations of the funds rate topping out in the 4½ to 4¾ percent December 13, 2005 54 of 100 neighborhood of its potential and to keep inflation stable.  In the staff forecast and in the markets, such a rise in the funds rate is seen as sufficient to contain inflation, and that strikes me as a reasonable estimate, pending further information. Although long-term rates haven’t changed much for several quarters, short- and intermediate- term rates have increased quite a lot and will continue to move higher as we firm policy.  These higher rates should exert increasing restraint on spending, especially for households that have been relying on borrowing at low short-term rates to short-circuit liquidity and income constraints when buying durables or houses. The slowing in consumer credit growth and mortgage loan applications in recent months may, indeed, indicate that higher short- and intermediate-term rates are beginning to bite.  Moreover, perhaps as a consequence of the rise in borrowing costs, we do see some signs of a cooling in housing markets, as many of you remarked.  Certainly the perceptions about housing markets of both builders and buyers have deteriorated noticeably in recent months, and the shift in attitudes may be particularly important when a significant portion of the activity in this market has been linked to investment demand.  Based on these indicators and others, a slowing of house price appreciation and a moderation in construction activity next year seem to be a reasonable expectation.  Such a slowing is a critical element behind the moderation in growth next year in the staff forecast, and I suspect in the market’s assessment as well. Still, we need to see more concrete evidence that this channel is working as anticipated, both in prices and in activity, before we can be confident that demand is likely to moderate.  Nonetheless, the incoming information also reinforces the notion that we can afford to retain the gradual path of policy tightening as we look for signs that moderation is coming.  With the upward revision to December 13, 2005 55 of 100 growth of potential.  In addition, the better productivity and the downward revision to compensation data show the increase in business costs being held in check better than had been evident.  And the higher rate of growth of structural productivity should help to hold down that increase in costs going forward.  Moreover, the markups of price over unit labor costs have risen appreciably in the last two quarters for both nonfarm business as a whole and, within that category, for nonfinancial corporations. And those markups are close to the record highs of the mid-1990s, suggesting that businesses have some room and incentive to absorb some of the increases in labor costs that might be coming. As a consequence of these developments, I think we can be a little less concerned about the immediate threat of higher inflation, though we still need to focus on forestalling the potential for supply-demand imbalances to develop over the medium run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"132";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On balance, economic activity is growing at a solid pace in the Fifth District, though auto sales are faltering and housing markets are cooling.  On the upside, employment conditions have been strengthening, with signs that the job numbers are increasing even at District factories.  Outside of autos and big-ticket items though, retail sales strengthened substantially this month.  Retailers indicate that holiday sales are solid, and they’ve become more optimistic about prospects for the first half of ’06.  Auto sales are weak, though, and December 13, 2005 41 of 100 revenues and employment growing over the last two months.  Home sales remain at high levels but we are receiving widespread reports that activity is decelerating, particularly in northern Virginia where markets have been quite robust in recent years.  A number of independent reports describe “a return to normalcy” in residential real estate markets, with houses actually being on the market and not getting multiple bids on the first day.  Manufacturing continues to hold its own.  Although shipments and new orders were softer in early December, the hiring index was up for our District, and firms have become notably more optimistic about their early ’06 prospects. District price pressures seem to have eased somewhat in December.  Although retail prices were reported to have advanced at the same strong pace as in November, outside the retail sector services’ prices have decelerated from October to December.  Manufacturing price gains peaked in November in our series, and our preliminary numbers show that both prices paid and prices received slowed sharply this month. Turning to the national economy, we’ve received a string of favorable data since our October meeting, suggesting both that the economy had considerable momentum prior to this fall’s storms and that the effects of the storms on economic activity outside the affected region and the energy sector have not been as large as feared.  I’m particularly encouraged by the continued strength in business investment spending in the present quarter, as evidenced by capital goods orders and the ISM numbers. I’m also encouraged by anecdotal reports of a cooling in District and national housing markets.  These reports are consistent with a continuing handoff from residential to business investment.  That said, I’m tempted to paraphrase Solow, though, and say that the slowdown in housing appears to be visible everywhere but in the housing activity data.  [Laughter] Consumer spending has held up quite well.  My sense is that the most important source of this December 13, 2005 42 of 100 reason, given the Greenbook forecast for income growth in the near term, I would not expect a flattening of housing prices to seriously dampen consumer spending.  Rather, I expect, consistent with the Greenbook, consumer spending growth to come in on the strong side going forward, with the saving rate rising only slowly. The inflation picture has also improved notably since our last meeting, in my mind.  The October core PCE number was heartening, and inflation expectations have been well behaved.  Both survey measures and TIPS compensation spreads have come down off the post-Katrina highs they reached earlier this fall. While the inflation picture is somewhat better, it does leave some room for concern, in my view.  This Greenbook forecasts a 2.2 percent core inflation rate for the first half of ’06, less than the last Greenbook, but it still makes me somewhat uncomfortable. With oil prices appearing to have found a stable range in the neighborhood of $60 a barrel and with natural gas prices remaining high and volatile, I think it will be several months before the risk of pass-through can be completely put to bed. As for the econometric evidence about pass-through, I’d note that expectations regarding our policy response represent a latent variable that of necessity is omitted in most econometric exercises. I take less comfort from the econometric evidence than you do, President Yellen.  Our preemption may be required for the pattern you found in the ’90s to actually continue to be confirmed in the data. In the meantime, I think we need to ensure that the public understands our resolve with regard to inflation.  And the real funds rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent is very likely too low for an economy that’s in a sustained expansion with relatively full resource utilization.  So I think it’s appropriate to follow through today with a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate. December 13, 2005 43 of 100"
"133";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  We’re a resilient group, Mr. Chairman.  [Laughter] We don’t get discouraged easily. Developments in the Seventh District have been mixed.  The data released since our last meeting indicate that manufacturing expanded at a moderate pace, while housing slowed and employment continued to be weaker than the national economy.  That said, our contacts seem to be more upbeat.  We continue to hear reports of labor markets becoming tighter, leading to potential wage pressure.  One of the national temporary help firms in our District mentioned that they are increasingly unwilling to guarantee their clients an hourly wage rate for the entire year.  Another indicated that entry-level wages are going up 3 to 4 percent but that at the mid- to upper-skill level wages are rising 5 to 7 percent. So I want to discuss two notable restructuring stories that point to the flexibility of the U.S. economy, albeit with government presence, notably on the pension front.  One is United, which is at the end game, and the other involves GM and Delphi, which is just beginning.  United’s CEO is optimistic about their prospects, as they expect to exit from bankruptcy in February.  Their business has continued to improve, and forward bookings suggest that strength should persist in the coming months.  United is gaining market share, while the industry overall is reducing capacity.  Having unloaded their pension liabilities on the PBGC and restructured their labor contracts and other December 13, 2005 27 of 100 Incidentally, the CEO of United admitted to me that Ned Gramlich was right.  He said that Ned’s position on federal loans forced United to do it the right way and to get the needed concessions from workers, suppliers, and creditors, and assistance from the PBGC. Turning to the auto industry, as I mentioned last time, Delphi’s bankruptcy could result in some meaningful restructuring of labor contracts.  But there is a significant risk of a strike that could seriously disrupt the auto industry, particularly General Motors.  The negotiations are at a delicate point with three key players—Delphi, the UAW, and GM.  Approximately 15 to 20 percent of GM’s parts come from Delphi, and GM has provided some guarantees to the Delphi workers for their pensions and health care benefits.  Clearly, the UAW is in a difficult position.  A strike could well cause Delphi to close its U.S. operations and reemerge as an international firm with a far smaller union workforce.  A prolonged strike at Delphi could also hobble GM.  In a worst-case scenario, this could force GM into bankruptcy, which would hurt the UAW workers at both GM and at Delphi.  As a result, all three parties have a strong incentive to avoid a strike. There have been some positive signs.  Delphi has postponed the deadline for an agreement from December 16th to at least January 20th, and GM has given some concessions to Delphi on prices.  In my conversations with Rick Wagoner, the CEO of GM, he felt that while a lot of antagonistic public statements have been made, the most likely outcome was that sanity would prevail and a strike would be averted.  But to avoid a strike, all three parties must throw something into the pot.  And he could not rule out some wildcat strikes at individual Delphi plants.  Of course, a settlement here does not solve GM’s longer-term problem, which is loss of market share.  And, as Dino mentioned, S&P downgraded GM’s corporate debt—not GMAC, but their corporate debt— December 13, 2005 28 of 100 In terms of the near-term outlook for auto sales, the consensus of 28 forecasters at our recent annual economic outlook symposium was for a small decline in sales in 2006 from this year’s expected pace of 16.9 million units.  GM and DaimlerChrysler’s forecasts were in line with this expectation, but Ford’s internal forecast is considerably lower, at 16½ million units. Turning to the national outlook, economic activity continues to grow at a solid pace.  Like the Greenbook, we see growth at or slightly above trend over the next two years, and this is also roughly in line with the consensus from our outlook symposium. The prospects for inflation present greater risks.  There are two plausible scenarios going forward.  In the first one, the increased energy costs in 2005 lead to a transitory increase in core inflation in ’06, but in ’07 core inflation comes back down.  This is the Greenbook baseline scenario. In the second scenario, the increase in core inflation is more persistent, in part because there is less slack in the economy in 2006.  Furthermore, monetary policy has been accommodative for a long time and there has been an accumulation of liquidity which ultimately could show through to higher nominal spending.  For these reasons, both inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations could remain elevated for longer than envisioned in the first scenario. Our statistical forecasts, based on the Stock-Watson methodology, are more in line with the second, less optimistic scenario.  Both scenarios are plausible, but the costs of the second one are higher. So from a risk management perspective, we need to put adequate weight on the second scenario. This may require more tightening next year than assumed in the Greenbook.  But at this point, we just don’t know.  Consequently, we should make sure that the statement does not give a premature signal that we’re near the end of the tightening cycle.  But, as you requested, Mr. Chairman, I’ll hold off further comments on the statement until the second round. December 13, 2005 29 of 100"
"134";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At each of our last eleven or twelve meetings there has been a presumption in the analysis for several more moves of tightening.  And while I agree that a ¼ point increase in the funds rate is appropriate for today, I no longer find in our analysis a presumption of multiple moves to raise it further. From Q4 to Q4, the rise in core PCE prices is estimated to be 1.8 percent in ’05, up to 2.1 percent in ’06, and back to 1.8 percent in ’07.  Now, the alternative scenarios for core PCE include a single option heavily driven by a presumed greater impact of rising energy prices on core inflation. And as I indicated to President Yellen, I’m interested in going back and rereading that analysis.  The Greenbook forecast is for the fed funds target to rise to 4½ percent and be maintained at that level.  I just looked at the chart in exhibit 1 that was handed out at the break and compared it to the chart that was in the Bluebook, and the market seems to be even more sure that we will overshoot and then retreat with respect to the fed funds rate. I share President Stern’s analysis with respect to the equilibrium real rate and the extent to December 13, 2005 59 of 100 think there’s a legitimate concern about the effect a premature pause would have on inflationary expectations, and I take that very seriously.  But, again, I do not see yet in our analysis where that needs to drive our concern.  Therefore, unlike in previous meetings, where there was a presumption of multiple increases, I think that perhaps after today we would need to look for a justification for such increases. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"135";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ve been debating whether we should characterize the expansion as vigorous or solid.  I decided that it’s vigorously solid.  [Laughter] On the consumption front, to give you an idea how strong demand is, my Wal-Mart contact says that 30 percent of the TVs they sell are now digital, up from 5 percent last holiday season.  They have greater sales also of other higher-end—medium and premium—price points.  And he says that inventory, if anything, is on the short side of desired levels, particularly for the higher-end items. A pervasive theme in my discussions with business people is that construction costs are rising rather rapidly.  Wal-Mart says 10 to 15 percent, and that seems to be generally true across the economy, according to my contacts.  The transportation industry, I think, is stretched at this point. For quite some time there have been problems with rail transportation of coal.  Our contacts with a power company in the St. Louis area said that they’ve been able to build stocks of coal at power plants but the level is still well below the normal, desired level. A contact with a major trucking company said that they have no plans to increase capacity in their truck business, which is about 30 percent of the total.  They plan a 5 percent increase in capacity in the intermodal area—that’s the piggyback business—and 10 percent capacity expansion in the dedicated truck business, which involves trucks for particular companies like Wal-Mart. My UPS contact said that they have been stretched quite tightly this holiday season; he mentioned that DHL has been having severe operational problems at its Wilmington, Ohio hub.  UPS could not find extra lift, as they call it, on an ad hoc basis and had to have work-arounds to have enough capacity to meet the demand.  UPS is planning to expand its China-to-U.S. capacity next year by 26 percent, which reinforces what Richard said a few minutes ago. There is a risk of disruption because of strikes.  UPS—and FedEx is right behind—is coming December 13, 2005 49 of 100 companies are now the best paid in the industry because the passenger airlines have reduced pilots’ pay. The pilots’ union is apparently adamant in wanting a larger piece of the profits of the company, so I think we should not by any means rule out the possibility of a strike at UPS early next year.  My contact there said that the level of frustration within the company about the various job actions by pilots is very high. Pilots have been calling in and saying, for example, that they’re fatigued and can’t fly, and they have caused a lot of disruption by tactics of that sort. I think those are the only comments I want to offer.  Thank you."
"136";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in Third District economic conditions since our last meeting.  The regional economy continues to expand at its potential pace, which is somewhat lower than in other parts of the country.  Payroll employment is increasing steadily in our three states, and the tri-state unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in October, which is its lowest level since May of 2001. Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey eased slightly to 11.5 in November from 17.3 in October. Although there has been some month-to-month volatility in the index this year, it has generally been near the average that was recorded in the 1990s expansion. Retailers report a slightly better sales figure for October and November compared to the same period a year ago.  In general, sales of luxury goods and consumer electronics continue to expand more strongly than other lines of merchandise, and discount stores had better results than mid-priced department and specialty stores. While construction continues to be a strong sector in our region, we are beginning to see early signs of moderation in the housing market.  These signs do not point to a sharp drop, only a slight softening of demand.  As elsewhere, permits have declined and real estate agents reported slower sales in October and November.  Some agents also noted that the number of existing homes on the market has risen and that the numbers of offers per house and above-asking-price bids have declined. There was also a slight easing in price appreciation in each of the three states in the third quarter, and this moderation appears to be continuing in the fourth quarter. We continue to see signs of higher prices for industrial goods in our region.  There was a sharp increase in the price indices in our manufacturing survey in October.  This eased only slightly in December 13, 2005 44 of 100 elevated.  The future price indices are high relative to most readings during the expansion, and the results of a special survey question indicate that cost increases are widely anticipated for all inputs next year.  These expectations are widespread across firms—and more widespread than during the summer period when we asked the same question.  Indeed, while our business contacts expect continued moderate expansion in business activity, rising prices beyond those in energy have become more of a concern for firms in our District. Turning to the national economy, I note that the Greenbook forecast has been revised to show more underlying strength in the third and fourth quarters compared to last time.  It’s more consistent with my own view on the national economy.  Incoming data over the intermeeting period suggest that the economy retained a good deal of upward momentum.  The third-quarter preliminary GDP figures showed broad-based strength in consumption and fixed investment growth, with strong productivity gains. Despite the dislocation from Hurricane Katrina, we have sturdy underlying job growth and a low unemployment rate.  Consumer confidence has partially recovered from post-hurricane lows, and consumer spending outside autos continues to advance at a moderate pace.  Business spending has also strengthened since the summer, and manufacturing productivity and business investment continue to advance.  In my mind, the risks to growth are slightly on the upside, as I read the data as supporting continued underlying strength. The official inflation numbers and readings on inflation expectations have been somewhat reassuring over the intermeeting period.  To date, we’ve seen little pass-through, as a number of people have noted, of higher energy prices into core inflation, and we’ve also seen some decline in energy prices.  In addition, both near-term and long-term inflation expectations have declined a bit. This news is clearly favorable to the inflation outlook.  However, it seems somewhat at odds with December 13, 2005 45 of 100 and have recently found it somewhat easier to raise their own prices in the current environment of quite strong demand.  This view has also been supported by our own and other manufacturing surveys. So I remain concerned about inflationary pressures, and I believe that an uptick in inflation is, indeed, a risk. Therefore, a prudent course of action today, in my opinion, is to continue to gradually move rates up. Whether such a move is closing in on the equilibrium real rate from below or whether such a move will put the real funds rate above the equilibrium value or place it in the range of uncertainty around the long-run value is an interesting question.  So is how we will explain what we are going to do. But I’ll defer my views on these issues until the second part of our discussion.  Suffice it to say I look forward to that.  [Laughter]"
"137";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me try to restart this discussion by saying, first, that I largely agree with the Greenbook assessment of the economy and, in particular, with the overall positive economic outlook it presents.  This is consistent with the incoming data on the national economy that we’ve received recently and with the preponderance of recent reports on the District economy as well.  Notably, the District is benefiting from an overall good year in agriculture, sustained improvement in the manufacturing sector, and what I would call positive substitution effects stemming from hurricane-related disruptions elsewhere, which have led, for example, to more shipping out of the Port of Duluth-Superior than otherwise would have occurred, more volume for local trucking firms, and so forth. One minor difference I might have with the Greenbook outlook pertains to the labor market and the unemployment rate. It seems to me that the forecast for economic growth in 2006 overall is December 13, 2005 50 of 100 dropped nearly a full percentage point from the end of 2003 to the end of 2005.  Using that as a rough guide or rule of thumb, I would think we’d get at least some modest further decline in the rate of unemployment next year.  I would hasten to add—and I think this is potentially a more important and maybe also a more controversial point—that even if we get that drop in the unemployment rate, it wouldn’t affect my inflation forecast.  In fact, looking at the totality of the information available, I don’t think that the risks to the core inflation outlook are skewed one way or the other, and I’m inclined to agree with Dave Stockton’s assessment that inflationary pressures are close to topping out. I say this because incoming data on core inflation have been relatively favorable, bond markets suggest to me that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and a lot of policy accommodation has been removed. Indeed, summing up these factors as well as the results from most versions of the Taylor rule presented in the Bluebook, calculations with Fisher-type interest rate equations, and the Greenbook forecast itself, it seems to me that after this meeting we will at least be very close to the point where we will have raised the federal funds rate sufficiently for now.  Thank you."
"138";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to echo Dave Stockton’s analogy of tidings of great joy in this forecast.  I think the upward revision in growth and the downward revision in inflation are developments that we all welcome at this point in the economic expansion. As I tried to assess some of the information to see where I would want to come out on policy, I tended to take an approach similar to the one President Yellen took, in saying: Where do we stand at this point in our effort to remove accommodation, and where are we going as we move forward?  In the alternative scenarios laid out in this Greenbook, there is really only one where long-term inflation expectations lose their anchor and which therefore gives me much concern.  As I looked at where we are on inflation, I was struck that there is some good news and some bad news and that there are currently risks on both sides.  Last year we saw inflation coming up from extraordinarily low levels— moving up from 1 percent to over 2 percent.  It rebounded quickly, and I was one who was quite concerned by how quickly inflation had moved up.  In the last six months, though, it has been 1.6 percent, which sounds like a fairly good area for it to be in.  But the fact that it rebounded so fast clearly indicates that we always have to be very alert to developments on that front, because prices can move rapidly. The energy pass-through, I think, is a risk for higher inflation.  I’d love to see the analysis that December 13, 2005 60 of 100 think we could see real concerns about disruptions and risks to the economy going forward—as a consequence, for example, of believing that energy prices are going to stay in a high range for several years or seeing the possibility of outright shortages in areas like natural gas. We’ve also seen that other central banks in the world are now expecting stronger growth and higher inflation in their economies.  The ECB [European Central Bank], as was mentioned earlier, finally raised its policy rate, and even the Bank of Japan is coming out of a zero rate world.  So some of the cushion we’ve had worldwide may be moderating, and that could produce more risks on the upside on inflation. On the other hand, when I look at what has been happening with jobs growth and labor compensation, I continue to be struck by how moderate the growth in compensation has been.  The productivity story is clearly one reason for this.  The numbers continue to amaze me at this point in the cycle.   It’s easy to achieve productivity gains in a company early on when you have excess capacity. But this many years into an expansion, it really takes a ton of attention and effort. Another thing that often comes up in my conversations with business executives is this:  They are sitting at very high levels of profit and cash flow generation; and when you ask them about their main challenges, they still say their primary challenge is to maintain profit growth.  If you start to dig into that, you find that it’s beyond just managing wage costs and looking at capital.  The lessons they learned in the ’90s in terms of really changing the way business processes are run are continuing to play a role in all of the decisions they’re making on issues like inventory management—not tying up capital either in inventory stored or in warehouse capacity. As I looked at last month’s numbers, inventory-sales ratios hit record lows.  So clearly, businesses are continuing to learn more and more about how to keep inventory levels very, very December 13, 2005 61 of 100 through better information systems and better order management systems. They also are focusing a great deal on quality control, particularly in services and retail businesses, and in business services where that is a key differentiator with the competition.  But better quality also has major cost benefits because it reduces errors and the need to redo work and it focuses on the timeliness of delivery.  And these are the kinds of values beyond prices that customers are rating as increasingly important.  So firms get both greater efficiency and value added for their customer base more than in the past. And finally, outsourcing—and I’m talking not internationally but simply outside of the core enterprise—is a business practice that evolved in the ’90s and has proven to be very important.  In the old days when you ran a big corporation that was vertically integrated, there were cost centers throughout the organization and it was very hard for CFOs to get a handle on controlling costs.  Now that the culture has become “if it isn’t a core function, you ought to try to outsource it,” the process of renegotiating with the contractors annually or semi-annually or every three years and of going out for other bids puts continual pressure on attaining productivity improvements and a favorable cost payback. But when the function was embedded in the bigger organization, the social politics sometimes got in the way and made it difficult to wring out the costs.  The fact is that firms now try not to do everything, and to outsource functions unrelated to their core business.  That this has become an ingrained practice in many companies is another theme I’m hearing.  So, in short, I’m finding that changes in business practices are the focus of a lot of companies.  And they believe that despite higher costs, they are going to be able to improve the value with modest price increases going forward. Pulling all of that together, I tend to think that we are very close to the end of the increases in interest rates that we need to implement.  There are risks on both sides, but it strikes me, based on the December 13, 2005 62 of 100 a minute ago, according to the Bluebook, the real fed funds rate that we would have with a 25 basis point increase today is at the midpoint of the range of the staff’s estimates of equilibrium.  Also, it’s above the funds rate derived from the policy rules for all of the alternatives.  So we are close to where I think we need to be, given the forecast.  As a result, I think we really do need to talk about how to make this transition and change our communication."
"139";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I think a fair reading of New England’s economy is that it continues to be a bit weaker than the nation’s as a whole.  To be sure, this sense is skewed by conditions in Massachusetts, which alone accounts for about half of the region’s employment.  Nonfarm employment declined again in October after a somewhat bigger drop in September, softening the region’s year-over-year job growth rate to about half of the nation’s as a whole. But Massachusetts accounted for more than the recent net losses, with job gains in all of the other states acting to offset drops in the Bay State.  Other indicators of state health show similar patterns.  In particular, the Philadelphia Fed’s coincident index shows growth in Massachusetts flattening while growth in the other five states is accelerating. A question one could ask, and one that I’ve been asking myself, is whether employment data and indices derived largely from measures of job growth correctly provide the best sense of the overall climate of a regional economy—and in the case of Massachusetts, a state economy—that is driven increasingly by high value-added industries whose employment patterns reflect cycles of innovation more than traditional business cycles.  Contacts in the high-tech, biotech, and software worlds all indicate that business is solid and that money to expand is freely available.  Depending on the product, growth is either occurring or in the works, but often the related hiring is planned for lower-cost states outside New England or other countries.  These businesses want their headquarters to remain in New England.  They want to strengthen their links to the research being done in the December 13, 2005 39 of 100 hard to find and increasingly expensive.  But when they expand more broadly, they are choosing to expand elsewhere. Thus, there are areas of strength and weakness in some of the regional data.  The states of the region seem to be doing pretty well fiscally, and that reflects the profitability of many of these high- tech types of businesses. But businesses that thrive on growing job counts, like commercial office markets, seem quite slow.  And personal income tax collections are lagging a bit, at least relative to what the states have projected in their budgets.  Somewhat surprisingly, consumer confidence has ticked up a bit despite the flat job picture, and residential real estate markets still seem strong, though the high end has lost a bit of steam.  Travel and tourism has its tos and fros.  The fall wasn’t particularly good for leaf peeping, but the winter looks not bad because there has been some early snowfall for skiing. The region is going to bear the brunt of high energy costs this winter, given its dependence on heating oil and expensive natural gas for electricity generation.  That probably is the reason why overall business confidence has softened a bit.  In my expectation, the region may well continue to lag the nation in job growth, but should prove resilient through the winter months.  I think the mix of its industries is not only providing resilience to the region but also an ongoing impetus to the productivity growth we see for the nation as a whole. Incoming data since the last Committee meeting were on the high side of our expectations and provided welcome assurance that at least for the time being the energy shock, hurricane destruction, and slight softening in housing markets did little to impede the underlying forward momentum of the national economy.  And the recent robust data on productivity growth provide even more assurance that this pace of underlying momentum is occurring at a time when there may be more rather than less December 13, 2005 40 of 100 Greenbook projection, which is certainly in the realm of the possible, available capacity could be even greater. Our forecast is perhaps not quite as optimistic as the Greenbook’s, but it does see the same two rather distinct economic phases over the forecast horizon.  In the near term, after a bit of a dip in the fourth quarter, which may not be much of a dip at this point, growth accelerates as hurricane rebuilding proceeds, federal spending increases, energy price growth rates flatten, and inventories are rebuilt. Then by mid-2006, the economy slows, as tighter monetary policy puts a crimp in real estate markets, the personal saving rate ticks up, as we hope it does, and the fiscal impulse wanes.  During the near term, inflation pressures are expected to be more significant, with some pass-through of high energy costs to core inflation.  Over the medium term, these pressures ease. It’s certainly possible for surprises on either side of this baseline.  That is, we could see inflation around longer than we now expect or, on the opposite side, we could see demand falter, with consumer retrenchment in the face of slower hiring.  I continue to believe that managing the risks of rising prices reduces the potential cost of mistakes, and that suggests some further tightening.  But how long that will be necessary, in my view anyway, is uncertain."
"140";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What a difference six weeks can make.  At our last meeting, the Greenbook offered two alternative scenarios—stagflation and a consumer sentiment slump—which at least from the Fourth District’s perspective seemed plausible and worrisome.  In early November, we had to consider the possibility that output growth might weaken even as inflation accelerated. Fortunately, the output and productivity data that we’ve received since that meeting have been on the upside, and the inflation news has been generally encouraging.  Although there are still various scenarios to worry about today, stagflation and a consumer sentiment slump no long appear to be among them.  My own information-gathering process during this intermeeting period leaves me very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline, which now expects more favorable paths for output, productivity, and inflation than it called for at our last meeting. I have a few observations about each of these.  First, output.  The national pace of economic December 13, 2005 46 of 100 on a slower improvement trend.  Bankers report that the commercial loan pipelines are filling up, and competition among lenders is very strong.  As I said, my District has been trailing the nation.  The automobile industry has a large weight in my District, and recent developments there, though not unexpected, are pretty dreary, as President Moskow reported.  The Big Three automobile companies and their suppliers are under intense pressure to downsize and reduce costs, especially labor costs. Many plant closings and layoffs have already been announced, and the dark clouds hanging over the industry are already having adverse effects on many communities.  But most business leaders I speak with outside of the automobile industry are optimistic about their national markets as they look into next year. Next I’ll comment on productivity.  The CEOs that I talked to are still working very hard to generate profits by increasing productivity.  I’m amazed by how frequently and uniformly CEOs talk about efficiency efforts under way in their companies.  A natural consequence of the productivity culture, of course, is that business people are watching their head counts very closely, even as their sales are expanding. Hospital executives are especially bullish about their ability to generate significant productivity gains, and they’ve been ramping up their capital spending on equipment and facilities.  One of my directors works for a large commercial construction company and reports that this is a nationwide trend. Finally, inflation.  Retailers tell me that they’ve trained their customers to shop for bargains only too well.  Consumers are relentless in their hunt for bargains, and Internet shopping is growing rapidly in popularity and making that hunt for bargains easier.  Retailers in the District tell me that they expect consumers to hang back and wait until the bitter end for steeper discounts, and those discounts are going to inevitably rise as Christmas looms close.  Consequently, retailers expect to turn December 13, 2005 47 of 100 they seek at this time of the year.  Discounting is extremely intense.  Sales volume, then, should turn out well, but profits may be disappointing. Some manufacturers say that they are finally getting a little traction with price increases above and beyond the energy surcharges.  But most manufacturers that I talked to report that competition remains very intense and they emphasize that they have little pricing power.  Although businesses have had to absorb price increases for many of their commodity inputs, several business executives note that raw materials prices have stopped increasing for the most part and, in many instances, have started to decline. So as I look at the national economy, I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook baseline.  I expect productivity growth to hold up rather well next year, along the lines of that faster productivity growth alternative scenario in the Greenbook.  Although I indicated in my report at our last meeting that we could see stronger pass-through of energy prices, I was not hearing that from my business contacts in their reports this time around.  In fact, many of them said that the energy and commodity price shocks that we’ve experienced in the past two years could move through our economy without elevating core inflation rates. The disappearance of the stagflation and consumer sentiment slump scenarios and the emergence of other risks serve as a reminder to me that the future, even the near-term future, is uncertain. The 70 percent confidence range surrounding the Greenbook baseline projection is wide enough to include all of the alternative simulations.  I believe, as a couple of others have already said, that with another move today our policy accommodation will have been substantially removed, making the timing and extent of additional firming more uncertain for me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. December 13, 2005 48 of 100"
"141";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data since our last meeting have been quite encouraging.  Economic growth over the next few quarters should be boosted by rebuilding and the full return of energy production in the Gulf.  As rebuilding winds down and the lagged effects of monetary policy tightening take hold, it seems plausible that growth will slow toward potential, keeping unemployment around the current level of 5 percent, the scenario envisioned in the Greenbook. The economy’s remarkable resilience in the face of devastating hurricanes and three years of rising energy prices suggest that the expansion has gained footing and no longer needs support from December 13, 2005 35 of 100 whether policy might actually need to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary pressures. I will therefore focus my attention on the factors affecting the inflation outlook.  To do that, we need to look first at the here and now and remind ourselves that recent readings on core prices have consistently come in at or below expectations.  There are no signs of acceleration.  In fact, core PCE [personal consumption expenditures] price inflation has slowed over the past year; the most recent reading of 1.8 percent over the past twelve months is down 0.3 from the preceding year.  And the downward inflation trend has continued through this year, with core PCE inflation running at only 1.6 percent over the past six months, which is about the middle of my preferred range.  Of course, even though recent core inflation data look pretty darn good, there may be forces at work that could undermine price stability.  In my remaining remarks, I’d like to comment on some factors that could push inflation higher and consider their likely effects in the current situation. The first risk to price stability is that, contrary to the Greenbook forecast, growth may not actually subside toward potential.  So labor and product markets could tighten further, pushing unemployment below NAIRU, which current estimates place around 5 percent.  This possibility is illustrated in the stronger aggregate demand scenario in the Greenbook.  That simulation shows that monetary policy would, of course, need to tighten.  But the inflation consequences would be modest, given a reactive Taylor rule monetary policy response.  So to deal with this risk, it seems to me that policy need not be preemptive. A sustained slowdown in productivity growth would pose a more challenging dilemma for policy and the inflation outlook.  Fortunately, however, productivity growth over the past year has not slowed.  Quite the contrary, it has been surprisingly robust.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business December 13, 2005 36 of 100 productivity growth of around 2¾ percent.  As I discussed at our meeting a year ago, I think there are compelling reasons why productivity growth may well remain elevated for some time, having to do with the gradual diffusion of new technologies and workplace practices throughout the economy. Therefore, I concur with the staff’s conclusion that the accumulated evidence indicates that structural productivity growth is around 3 percent and with the corresponding upward revision in the outlook for actual productivity.  Given the sluggish adjustment of wages to changes in productivity, the stronger path of productivity reduces the rate of growth of unit labor costs, putting downward pressure on inflation.  So productivity trends suggest a tempering of inflationary pressures, not an intensification. Energy prices also pose a potential threat to inflation.  But as I argued a few meetings back, the empirical evidence does not support significant pass-through of energy prices into core inflation.  I won’t repeat those arguments today but simply note, once again, that core PCE inflation has actually moderated, despite a nearly 30 percent increase in energy prices over the past year, on top of a 15 percent rise in the previous year.  Moreover, energy prices on the whole have come down sharply of late, and, therefore, the risk of significant pass-through to core inflation has moderated as well. In addition, it appears that the Fed’s credibility has held up well this year, despite the supply shocks associated with higher energy prices and hurricanes.  Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are about where they stood before the storms.  Longer-run inflation expectations based on Treasury securities have come down about ¼ percentage point since the last FOMC meeting and are now below levels of a year ago. Finally, it’s possible that wage growth could accelerate, putting upward pressure on the growth of unit labor costs and inflation.  And, indeed, the Greenbook forecast projects exactly such an acceleration, reflecting lagged pass-through of earlier increases in both energy prices and productivity December 13, 2005 37 of 100 employment cost index, will increase 4.2 percent in 2006, following a 3 percent gain this year.  It projects an even larger—1.7 percentage point—acceleration in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector. To gauge the likelihood of such an acceleration in compensation, my staff examined the pass- through of energy prices and productivity into wages.  They used forecasting models in which wage inflation is determined by lagged wage inflation, price inflation, productivity growth, and the unemployment rate.  Now, it turns out that when the sample period used in the analysis includes the 1970s, our empirical work finds clear evidence of pass-through from energy prices into compensation. But when the sample begins in the 1980s, pass-through effects from energy prices to compensation are dramatically weaker or insignificant.  This result is consistent with the finding I reported previously.  There is no real evidence that energy prices pass through to core consumer inflation since the early 1980s.  With respect to the pass-through of productivity growth into compensation, our staff finds evidence of only very gradual pass-through regardless of the sample period.  Going forward, our models predict significantly less increase in compensation growth than the Greenbook over the 2006­ 2007 forecast horizon.  We conclude from this empirical work that an increase in inflation due to a sharp acceleration in compensation growth is, at most, an upside risk to inflation and not the most probable outcome. I opened my remarks by noting that a key issue facing us over the next few meetings is whether policy needs to move to a restrictive stance in order to forestall inflationary pressures.  While we must obviously remain vigilant and respond to developments that threaten price stability, the evidence that we have at this time, in my opinion, points to relatively low and stable inflation going December 13, 2005 38 of 100 tightening takes hold and the economy reaches a turning point.  Therefore, it’s important that we keep the lags of monetary policy actions in mind in our deliberations and not go too far."
"142";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20051213meeting.csv";" Our forecast for the national outlook has not changed substantially since the last meeting, and relative to the discussions so far, I guess we’re slightly at the stronger end. The recent data have been encouraging both here and internationally.  The underlying pace of demand growth seems pretty good to us—good enough to raise the probability of the expansion continuing at a pace at or slightly above trend.  The inflation news has also been reassuring, though December 13, 2005 51 of 100 We believe these conditions justify some further tightening of monetary policy, perhaps another 50 to 75 basis points. We are, therefore, comfortable with the expectations now built into the market.  And with that monetary policy assumption, we think the risks to the forecast and to our objectives are roughly balanced.  So, relative to September and October, we see somewhat less downside risk to growth, perhaps even some upside risk, and somewhat less upside risk to inflation. As this implies, our view is very close to the Greenbook. Let me mention a few other points.  The apparent strength in productivity should make us more comfortable about the sustainability of the expansion and a bit less concerned about the near- term inflation risks because, of course, if the productivity growth stays stronger longer, we can be more confident that consumer spending will stay reasonably strong even if a more substantial slowdown in housing materializes.  Scenarios in which more-moderate house price appreciation or some decline in housing prices leads to a sizable increase in the personal saving rate are probably less plausible or less troubling in an environment where consumers are more confident in the outlook for the economy or more confident in their future income growth. The productivity news, combined with continued moderation in the core inflation numbers and the moderation in measures of inflation expectations, make the inflation outlook somewhat more favorable.  But against these factors there are others that justify some continued attention.  Of course, overall inflation is still high, even though we expect it to moderate.  Various measures of underlying inflation are still above what we would be comfortable with over time.  There probably is still some energy cost pressure in the pipeline.  And the TIPS-derived measures of inflation expectations over the medium term, if you adjust for the carry effect, have not really moved down that much.  With compensation growth accelerating, we would expect eventually to see some upward pressure on labor December 13, 2005 52 of 100 surveys and anecdotal reports of pricing behavior, as we read them, suggest that businesses are able to pass on some share of their increased costs.  So for these reasons, even with the additional tightening priced into the markets, we probably face some modest upside risk to our inflation forecast and to our objective, and we should continue to lean against this risk in what we do and what we say. We don’t see evidence yet to support a concern that the path of the nominal fed funds rate now priced into the markets risks going too far.  Housing may be slowing a bit, but not really much. Other spending indicators look strong—probably stronger than we thought—and the strength is broader than it has been across the components of GDP.  Expected real rates don’t suggest a high degree of concern, in our view.  It’s just some concern, but not acute concern about the downside risk to future growth.  If you try to take out expected inflation from forward rates, it looks as if real rates move up over the 2- to 5-year horizon.  Equity prices, credit spreads, and the implied volatility of most asset prices don’t seem to suggest a lot of concern about significant deterioration ahead in the pace of the expansion. Although we don’t think the narrowing of the term spread itself or the low overall level of the yield curve offers clear guidance about monetary policy—clear guidance in terms of arguing for a softer or firmer stance than the other fundamentals might suggest—we’re somewhat more inclined to take the view that this change in the structure of term premia suggests we will have to do more than otherwise would have been the case.  So all of this suggests to us that we should continue to tighten further and signal that we think we have still more to do."
"143";"CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Any further questions for our colleagues?  If not, before we go to the general discussion, because of the unusual nature of this particular one-day session with various timing problems, I just calculated that, in the eighteen years I’ve been here, we’ve gone from an average presentation of three minutes to one of six minutes.  [Laughter]  The drift has been inexorably upward.  And I will suggest to you that, unless we are somewhat unusually restrained today, we’re going to run way over what our luncheon plans are, and we will be forced to call them dinner.  [Laughter]  So may I suggest, if at all possible, that you try to restrain the time that you’re employing on this particular occasion.  With those restrictions, who would like to start off? [Laughter],   Thank you.  President Yellen.,   Thank you.  President Santomero.,   I should point out that a luncheon in the President’s honor is planned at the March meeting.  And I guess you and I will be looking from the sidelines, but neither one of us will know what happened at that March meeting until we get to it.  [Laughter]  Thank you for your nice remarks.  President Minehan.,   President Fisher.,   Thank you very much.  And the last time I spoke to Henry V [laughter] I got a view of his notions of strategy.  President Lacker.,   Thank you very much.  President Pianalto.,   President Guynn.,   President Hoenig.,   Let’s break for coffee.  Since our time is really quite restricted, I would request that we come back in seven minutes.  [Laughter] [Coffee break],   David Stockton.,   Thank you.  President Poole.,   “How to Be a Joyous Central Banker, Even Though We Don’t Have Hearts.”  [Laughter]  Can we end the speculation on the title?  [Laughter]  Thanks very much, Bill.  President Stern.,   Vice Chair.,   I am most appreciative.  [Laughter],   Governor Olson.,   Thank you very much, Governor.  Governor Ferguson.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Governor Bies.,   Thank you so much.  Vincent."
"144";"MR. FERGUSON.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Greenbook baseline presents a relatively positive scenario.  But as the 90 percent confidence interval given in the Greenbook clearly indicates, there is considerable uncertainty around this baseline.  In a theoretical world of certainty equivalence, that range of uncertainty would not matter.  But as you’ve taught us many times, in the world of practical policymaking, how that uncertainty is resolved will matter importantly for policy judgments. As a mere cadet, if you will, sitting next to the monetary policy Yoda, [laughter] I will attempt to look at some of these uncertainties and to understand how they may unfold in their implications for policy.  Yoda, of course, is a complimentary word in my household.  [Laughter] One particularly salient aspect of uncertainty relates to the way that inflation expectations are influenced by energy prices.  As we’ve seen recently, despite spiking oil prices in December, near- term inflation expectations remained stable or edged even somewhat lower, reversing the run-up that we saw in the fall.  As the presentation this morning showed, preliminary January Michigan survey results for median inflation expectations for the coming year ticked down, and median five- and ten-year inflation expectations also moved lower.  Rate spreads from TIPS also indicated remarkably contained inflation expectations despite oil price shocks. This stability is both remarkable and quite important, because, in my view at least, the optimal course of monetary policy at this juncture depends critically on the fragility or stability of inflation expectations in the presence of the oil price shock.  I judge that, for now at least, this important element of uncertainty supports a continued execution of the strategy we are following to date, with no need to fear that we’re falling behind the curve, even as energy prices have spiked again.  Of course, with the slight rise in the near-term inflation outlook and, in fact, slight deterioration in near-term inflation itself, prudence will require close monitoring of these variables as we go forward.  But thus far, I judge that the announced strategy is consistent with maintaining our credibility. Second, as we discussed earlier, there is great uncertainty about why long-term rates are low and what the shape and level of the yield curve may imply for us.  As we saw in yesterday’s Board briefing, forward nominal rates fairly far out in time have moved down over the past year, both here and abroad, and are low today by historical standards.  As we know, long-term rates are low today partly because inflation expectations are low.  If this were the whole story, short-term rates would not need to depart from the historical terms or norms in real terms.  But while this is part of the story, it isn’t the whole story.  As we’ve already discussed, if the shape of the yield curve and low rates both indicated that market participants expected some further economic weakness, then the proper response would be to run a looser-than-average monetary policy. But I agree, and I think most of us agree, with the staff assessment that the low real long- term interest rate and a flat yield curve are not precursors to a global softening and an expected drop in rates but rather are due to an unusually low term premium.  In my judgment, part of the reason for that low term premium is an increased assessment on the part of global investors that the future looks like an environment involving less risk than usual.  This was borne out I think in Dino’s pie charts earlier on and also in the global equity markets.  I’d also say, based on various conversations I’ve had with central bankers in January on the various committees that I attend and others I attend with the Chairman, there is a general sense in the world of policy that this low-risk assessment is approximately right.  However, I continue to think that these lower rates reflect some forces that are holding back investment demand globally.  And, for the United States, I think they also reflect a drag from the external sector.  However, with corporate balance sheets in good shape and global growth firming, I don’t expect a sudden reassessment of risk and a rise in the term premium to result from these sources. I do have some concern that we may see a snapback in term premiums from another source that we’ve touched on a bit already, and that’s the third and final uncertainty I wish to look at, which is the housing sector.  Here I’d say that President Santomero’s comments in some sense preceded and introduced mine.  I don’t doubt that the housing market is slowing somewhat, but I do wonder about the impact of a slowing of house prices and wealth extraction on household saving and consumption.  Here I pick up where Dave left off, which is that the models take a historical norm. Let’s say we’re at about the 3 percent that Dave indicated.  I think there’s possibly a greater risk, for reasons that Dave has already indicated, that we may find a much stronger impact on the global economy, certainly on the U.S. economy, based on a slowing of housing prices.  And here, though I recognize their economies are different, I am still somewhat troubled by the experience in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands, all of which had an unexpectedly large impact, from a GDP standpoint, from a relatively slow flattening of house prices.  I recognize that these other economies are different from ours, but I’d also say that we’ve seen even in our own economy some nonlinearities that have emerged—for example, as asset prices moved down relatively rapidly—that might have surprised us in the past. So what’s the implication of all of these uncertainties?  I’d like to put three things on the table for this meeting.  First, I continue to believe, as I think the Greenbook or the Bluebook does, that the equilibrium real rate has, in fact, moved down somewhat on average, to lower than it was, let’s say, over the past ten years, with the exception of the recessionary periods of 2001 and 2002. Second, I firmly believe, as do many of you, that we are well within the range of neutrality at this stage.  And, third, since I would say there’s a great deal of uncertainty here, I want to make sure that what we say, both in word and in deed, reflects a great deal of flexibility.  I heard Vice Chairman Geithner suggest that we want to put out some words that say it’s probable that we’ll move at the next meeting.  I suggest that we be a little more nuanced and put out some words that suggest it’s at least possible that we move at the next meeting. Having said all of that, obviously, I, along with everyone else, think that what happens going forward will be extraordinarily data-dependent.  All the more reason for us to keep, if you will, our powder dry and our options open.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
"145";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, I took note of the two Davids’ forecast of 4.7 percent growth in the first quarter.  Especially against President Yellen’s comments, it brought to mind the name of one of Henry Jerome’s albums on the Decca label called “Brazen Brass.”  That is, some might consider brazen or even brassy that it jibes or, in this context, jives with what I’m hearing anecdotally both in our District and nationwide—though we have only three and a half weeks of observations and the year-end to look at. Very quickly to sum up these observations, the CFO of UPS put it this way: “The economy feels much better than what I read.”  UPS reports a very strong December adjusted for seasonality, and January has stayed strong.  Over the year-end in the recent past, they have had only one holiday peak day of processing 20 million shipments.  They had three at year-end of more than 21 million. Burlington Northern–Santa Fe’s volume for the first three weeks of ’06 is up 9 percent year over year.  Interestingly, they just auctioned off their entire lumber-carrying capacity for the year at an 8 percent premium over current market.  Texas Instruments reports a positive book-to-bill ratio, which is a very rare thing coming out of the fourth quarter.  They find that they underinvested relative to demand and report a seven- to ten-day delivery delinquency rate.  As the CFO says, “We have stopped scratching our heads about demand, and we’re just taking it all in.” The CEO of Wal-Mart U.S.A. reports that “the consumer hasn’t hidden” as expected.  It’s true that traffic is down, but average purchases are up in the Southeast and Texas, and the West is strongest in overall demand, aided by the warmest winter by their calculations in 112 years.  The CEO and the top managers met with their 5,000 suppliers the week before last in Kansas City, and he reported that the suppliers described themselves as “upbeat.”  Wal-Mart and others report what we’re hearing from the railroads, the shippers, and other retailers—all of which lends verisimilitude to what was evident if you parse the Beige Book. And that is that the rim—from Richmond down through Atlanta to the State of Florida and then, of course, the “uber” states across Texas and up to California and the West Coast—is enjoying robust growth.  To the extent that there’s weakness, it appears to be in the north central and northeastern regions. On the price front, Dick Evans, on our board, of Cullen/Frost, a very astute banker, says that he “keeps hearing people talk about potential inflation, but the economy seems to be able to pull it out of the hat.”  Wal-Mart International reports no pricing power other than in resin-based products. The CEO marvels at how the world continues to, as he puts it, “replace technology at lower and lower prices.”  Further up the retail chain, Penney’s CEO reports no price inflation in home furnishings and continued price deflation in apparel.  And on the two subjects for which I reported price pressures before, the CEO of DX Services, a large chemical company, reports that PVC prices have fallen off because of overproduction but the prices of the key building blocks of chlorine and ethylene are falling.  “There’s no pricing on the upside,” according to that CEO.  And as for my other favorite subject of diapers, incidentally, Proctor & Gamble and Kimberly Clark have rolled back their price increases of 5 percent. Our shipping contact at Northern Navigation reports that Panamax rates—and Panamax is the key fleet of bulk carriers—are now down to $16,700 per day from $17,300 in December, which was down 35 percent from the average for the year of ’05.  The container fleet will absorb a 14 percent increase in fleet size per year for the next three to four years driven largely by what one could consider Chinese ego because they have now entered the building market in size.  And interestingly, UPS worries that, if this continues, they will come under price pressure to decrease air freight rates.  Despite fierce demand and delivery delinquencies, Texas Instruments reports that it has slowed down its price increases. So, Mr. Chairman, we have forecast a core PCE inflation of 2 percent for the year, and we feel comfortable with it.  I started with Henry Jerome.  Let me conclude with another Henry, the Fifth, at least as written by Shakespeare.  I’ve been honored to serve with you, Mr. Chairman, the least time of anybody at this table.  In Alfalfan terms, I’m just a sprout in the crop of otherwise experienced men and women.  But I’m sure they would agree with me, without getting too dramatic, about the appropriateness of Henry V’s remarks at Agincourt—and I’ll rephrase them— economists and bankers now asleep (remember these are bankers) shall think themselves accursed that they were not here.  I consider myself privileged to have been here, Mr. Chairman.  This isn’t Agincourt, but it’s important.  I’ve served under two saxophone players now, [laughter] and I would say without question, you’re a leader of the very best kind, and I thank you for your leadership."
"146";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also have not had the occasion in the public farewell ceremonies to say thank you to you.  So let me say what an honor it has been to serve under your leadership and to be associated with the great confidence and respect you’ve given people in what we do at the Fed.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. Given your request for brevity, let me confine my remarks to a few observations about our District that may have implications for the national outlook.  Generally I would say that the anecdotal information and the available data suggest that economic growth in our southeast region continues at a very solid pace.  At the past two meetings, I reported evidence of the slowing in the real estate markets, and those reports continue.  It has become especially notable in a few selected markets, including several that have been hot for some time, like Florida.  Banks are now clearly pulling back on their construction lending.  We’re receiving increasing numbers of reports that planned projects have either been put on hold or are not going to come out of the ground.  And we’re now beginning to see some signs of downward pressure on prices—in some cases in the high single digits, but in a few markets substantially higher than that.  As an example, we heard one report that in the Panama City area of Florida, condos that had been going for $600 a square foot are now being priced at $450 a square foot.  That’s a 25 percent correction.  I think we have to view these corrections that are taking place as healthy.  Worker shortages due to hurricane cleanup work in Louisiana and coastal Mississippi are also contributing to the slowdown in Florida.  I would emphasize, again, that this evidence is not indicative of a broad trend throughout the District.  Our general real estate situation still feels pretty solid. I’d also like to make a couple of comments on the situation of the hurricane areas, where, according to the staff , FEMA spending turned out to be less than expected in the fourth quarter.  At the last meeting I noted it had become clear that the stimulus from the flow of government funds would be slower than expected.  Work in both Mississippi and Louisiana is still mostly in the initial cleanup phase.  Despite what we see in public statements, there is no substantial rebuilding under way yet, except for casino reconstruction in Mississippi.  The grace period on mortgage payments has already or is about to run out, and this could bring additional hardship for the affected property owners, with obvious implications for lenders.  Indeed, a handful of small community banks may actually be at risk. Considerable uncertainty exists concerning federal flood insurance policies going forward, and in certain areas no rebuilding can take place until flood maps are redrawn, building codes are reassessed, soil contamination is assessed, and permits are issued—all of which could take many, many months.  Because so few people have been able to move back to their properties, even those homes that were only modestly damaged by the storm are now beginning to show signs of deterioration due to mold and a lack of maintenance and repairs.  I think the take-away from this discussion is that the economic kick we’ve been expecting from hurricane rebuilding is probably going to be spread over 2006, 2007, and perhaps even a bit further. The damage to the energy sector in the Gulf now appears to have been worse than most had thought.  Although national production of crude is reported back at about 92 percent of pre- hurricane levels and natural gas production is back to 95 percent of pre-hurricane levels, our sources tell us that 25 percent of the Gulf region capacity for crude and about 16 percent of the Gulf capacity for natural gas remain shut in.  And that shortfall, in my view, remains significant.  More than half the crude oil that is shut in is attributable to the production lost from Shell’s Mars platform, which isn’t expected to be operational until mid-2006.  Our contacts are also now saying that natural gas production will probably not fully return to pre-hurricane levels because the production at several sites is already in decline—as much as 8 percent below the peak. Finally, as has been the case for some time, we’ve continued to receive information from our directors of pricing pressures, of plans to push through price increases, and of a greater willingness on the part of upstream purchasers to accept those increases.  And I think we are likely seeing some of that in the latest inflation data. On the national front, very briefly, like everyone else, I was surprised and somewhat disappointed by the considerably weaker than expected initial report on fourth-quarter GDP, but like the Greenbook, I think I’m satisfied that we can explain most of the shortfall.  I do not see it as an erosion of fundamentals, and in fact, I think we may well see some offsetting gains in the current quarter.  I expect a return to solid growth in the current quarter.  My own forecast for output, inflation, and unemployment for 2006 and 2007 remains positive. At the same time, there are some especially interesting unknowns and risks at the moment that we’ll have to watch being played out.  As others have already suggested, energy remains a major wild card with the very delicate balance between worldwide supply and worldwide demand. With recovery of the energy industry in our Gulf Coast region not yet complete, with the fragile political situation in many oil-producing regions around the world, and with the ever-present risk of natural disaster and sabotage, it seems reasonable to expect continued elevated energy prices and substantial energy-price volatility.  It’s not clear to me whether households and businesses have fully adjusted to these new realities.  The residential real estate adjustment, which seems to be beginning to take place both in the level of activity and in prices, could have important implications, as Dave Stockton and others have already suggested.  Whether consumers will be able and willing to continue to smooth their expenditures relative to current income seems to be substantially dependent upon home prices, mortgage interest rates, and the ability to tap home equity.  And the potential inflation pressures we’ve highlighted for some while, and which still do not seem to have played out fully, should not be too easily and too quickly discounted. All things considered, I think we have to be reasonably comfortable with the outlook and the policy path we have been on, but I look forward to discussions of policy and the way we communicate what we see ahead.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"147";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, in thinking about the status of the U.S. economy and the appropriate funds rate target at this meeting, I would start by suggesting that, in my judgment at least, the current funds rate is probably within the neutral range.  Therefore, we should be mindful of not going too far, especially when it would appear that growth is slowing to trend.  The most compelling reason for considering the move now is the continued drift upward in core inflation, but even in this case, I think we need to be especially aware of the past increases in the funds rate.  We have yet to see their full effects on inflation. The fourth-quarter growth was surprising; but at this point, as others have said, it does not yet alter our long-term outlook.  Like the staff, however, I revised upward my 2006 forecast ¼ percentage point and now expect that growth will be about 3¾ percent in 2006, about ½ percentage point above trend, and will return to trend in 2007.  Turning to the inflation outlook, I expect core CPI inflation to be about 2½ percent this year, as higher energy prices are passed through to higher overall and core inflation.  However, it is reasonable to expect that the increase will be temporary, as others have said, with core inflation likely to fall back to 2¼ percent in 2007. The reasons for this pattern have a familiar ring.  Greater-than-trend growth reflects the lagged effects of past monetary accommodation and generally supportive financial conditions, whereas the prospective slowing growth reflects the removal of monetary accommodation and, in this instance, higher energy prices. Evidence from our District is consistent with an outlook of strong but slowing growth as well.  Manufacturing production and new orders rose solidly.  Expectations for future production remained high, and expectations for future orders actually surged.  Hiring plans also rose strongly in December and January.  However, for the District as a whole, hiring announcements were only slightly greater than layoff announcements.  Finally, housing showed signs of leveling off, and consumer spending was solid, though not spectacular, during the holiday season.  In fact, a number of our contacts said their holiday sales were below plan.  Just quickly in the farm sector, there are concerns being voiced for 2006 following a generally good year in 2005, and they were mostly that drought may be reemerging in the District. Wage pressures in the District remain mostly subdued, and increases in raw material costs actually slowed somewhat.  However, manufacturers continued to raise output prices in response to past increases in input costs, and a substantial number said they were raising wages more than normal for certain types of workers in short supply.  Reports of retail prices said that increases were down somewhat from the last meeting but still higher than they were just last summer. Let me turn just briefly to the risks.  I would submit that inflation risks are on the upside and output risks have become more on the downside recently, not exactly the kinds of risk that are friendly from a policy perspective.  The outlook for core inflation is 2¼ to 2½ percent.  This is higher than I would prefer.  Moreover, the potential for even higher energy prices makes core inflation more likely to be higher rather than lower over the next several months.  But at the same time, the risks to output are on the downside.  First, forward momentum has certainly diminished. For example, real GDP grew about 2.6 percent during the last half of 2005, decidedly below trend. In addition, while the fourth-quarter slowdown was probably temporary, it could also be signaling a more fundamental slowdown.  Finally, a possible increase in the term premium poses downside risks to growth.  You know the term premium is far below the historical average.  If the decline reverses faster than expected, both would be significantly weaker as shown by the Greenbook alternative scenario.  As I see things then falling out, the choices are obviously difficult, but I think that the inflation risk for the time-being is the greater risk, and therefore I would be inclined to move at this meeting.  But we should have the odds no greater than 50-50 that more upward changes are likely in the fed funds rate at the next meeting. And finally, Mr. Chairman, although I have not served as long with you as some others around this table, I have served among the longest with you, and I would like you to know it has been a real privilege."
"148";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The projections I submitted for this meeting reflected expectations of an economy that probably is operating in level terms somewhere in the neighborhood of its long-run, sustainable potential and will continue to do so over the next two years with growth broadly in line with the growth of potential and inflation basically stable.  My forecasts for 2006 are very close to those I submitted last January and June.  That’s partly a product of innate stubbornness.  [Laughter]  But it also reflects the fact that 2005 came in largely as expected—after allowance for hurricanes and an energy shock last year that elevated core inflation and damped growth somewhat compared with our forecasts last January.  This is encouraging in that it suggests that we are not looking at major unexplained and unanticipated forces acting on the economy. At this point, our focus appropriately is on keeping inflation contained.  I see several reasons for optimism in this regard.  One is the performance of core consumer prices and price measures, which continue to suggest that the pass-through of higher energy prices will be limited.  Core inflation was roughly stable last year.  It picked up a bit in the fourth quarter, but that was from unusually low readings in the third quarter.  Declining consumer inflation expectations in the most recent Michigan survey, along with the failure of market-based inflation compensation readings to respond significantly to the substantial run-up in oil prices and higher core readings over the intermeeting period, just reinforce my assessment that any pass-through should be small and limited in duration. As we noted at the last meeting, perhaps the greater threat to sustained good inflation performance comes from possible increases in pressures on resources.  The critical question is whether growth in output close to trend is a reasonable expectation with only modest further policy firming, given the low level of long-term rates, reduced drag from energy prices, and a boost from rebuilding.  I thought it was a reasonable expectation, for a number of reasons.  First, after smoothing through the fluctuations caused by auto incentives and hurricanes, private domestic final demand already showed signs of moderation last year.  Growth in private domestic final sales slowed from 4¼ percent in the first half of the year to 3 percent in the second half of the year, with every element—consumption, business fixed investment, residential housing investment— moderating.  The staff estimates that about 0.3 of this was due to hurricane effects, but that still leaves underlying private demand slowing to an annual rate of about 3¼ or 3½ percent.  This moderation did not reflect the full effects of our policy tightening, especially on the housing market. Even well-anticipated increases in the short-term rates seem to be having a significant effect on housing markets, which have become more dependent on adjustable rate mortgages to maintain affordability.  We are just beginning to see the anticipated slowdown in this sector. With growth in consumption and sales constrained by a leveling-out of housing wealth, businesses are unlikely to see the need to step up the pace at which they are adding to their capital stock.  As a consequence, investment growth could slow, at least slightly, over the next few years, reflecting reduced impetus from the accelerator.  Finally, although foreign economies are strengthening some, foreign investment and consumption remain subdued relative to income.  And given our continuing outsized appetite for imports, net exports are unlikely to be putting added impetus to demands on domestic production. I think there are several upside and downside risks around this picture of growth near potential, as a number of you pointed out.  I agree that the housing market is the most likely source of a shortfall in demand.  I don’t think we can have much confidence about how the dynamics of this market will play out now that it has begun to soften.  My suspicion is that, as little bubbles in the froth are popped, the risks are tilted more toward quite a sharp cooling off than toward a very gradual ebbing of price increases and building activity.  On the other side, it seems to me global demand would be a major upside risk to growth and to price stability.  The extraordinarily rapid rise in commodity prices and upward movement in global equity prices may indicate a very fundamental turnaround in foreign demand and attitudes beyond just a stepwise strengthening of growth.  For now, these remain risks that we’ll need to monitor. In making my forecast, I assumed we would tighten at this meeting, and likely at the next as well, to gain greater assurance that inflation will remain contained over time, consistent with my forecast of a 1¾ percent increase in core prices in 2007.  However, I do see action in March as dependent on the readings we get in coming months.  There is, as usual, considerable uncertainty about the precise nature and magnitude of the risk to the outlook, but we’re dealing with an economic picture that overall is remarkably good and expected to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Reflecting on this situation, among many, many aspects of the past, I end my remarks as I began them:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"149";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic activity continued to advance broadly in December and January.  Service-sector employment and revenue strengthened, and retailers reported generally strong sales and a pickup in hiring.  In manufacturing, the signals are mixed.  Shipments flattened out in December and turned down in January, and our new orders index turned negative as well.  At the same time, we’ve seen a very sharp rise in our index of expected manufacturing shipments six months out.  Major swings in this index do a pretty good job of predicting subsequent upturns in orders and shipments.  The last time we saw a rise nearly this steep was at the beginning of 2002, and a sharp rebound in orders and shipments soon followed. While the figures for prices paid and prices received for both manufacturing and services have come down off their November highs, they remain noticeably elevated, and measures of expected price trends have moved up over the past two months. On the national economy, until I saw the fourth-quarter GDP report, I was thinking that economic growth was on pretty solid footing.  Friday’s report came in weaker than expected, of course, but as Dave Stockton mentioned, it appears plausible that several temporary factors are at work.  So I continue to think that prospects for economic growth are pretty good this year.  Both employment and consumer spending are likely to continue expanding at a healthy pace, and the fundamentals for business investment point toward fairly robust spending growth. At our last meeting, I, like many others, believed that the threat that energy-price increases would pass through to core inflation and inflation expectations had diminished since the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  However, I wasn’t convinced that the threat was entirely behind us, and unfortunately, my concerns on that score remain.  Oil prices have nearly returned to their September highs.  The fourth-quarter core PCE price index came in at 2.2 percent, 0.3 above the Greenbook’s estimate, and the Greenbook has reversed course and marked up the ’06 inflation forecast a bit.  The staff is now expecting core PCE inflation to rise to 2.3 percent in the middle of 2006 and not to fall below 2 percent until 2007 and then only slightly below.  This forecast represents a bulge that is somewhat more extended than I would like to see.  So, for today, I believe we should strive not to move the near-term yield curve down. In the broader context of the historic nature of today’s meeting, however, it’s quite striking that among the prominent subjects are a quarter-point bulge in inflation and the issue of whether long-run and trend inflation should be 1.5 percent or 2.0 percent.  Few now doubt whether the Federal Reserve can or will keep inflation stable, a question that was seriously in play decades ago. Your leadership in the intervening years, Mr. Chairman, completed the work begun by your predecessor to restore the expectation of price stability that had been lost in the transition from the prior commodity standard.  Given the number of centuries that regime was in place, I believe future monetary historians would be justified in marking the Volcker–Greenspan era as a millennial transition.  This achievement required altering public expectations about the trend rate of inflation that we would tolerate.  It also required substantially damping the association between strong real growth and resurgent inflation.  Moreover, it required demonstrating that there was no need for adverse cost shocks to spawn higher trend inflation.  The key to all of this, in my mind, was establishing a pattern of predictable FOMC behavior that was well understood by the public. Leading this transition as you did, Mr. Chairman, required tremendous acumen and tremendous courage.  Personally, Mr. Chairman, I count serving with you, however briefly, as one of the greatest privileges an economist could imagine."
"150";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  With restraint, Mr. Chairman, most of our contacts this round were positive about current business conditions.  However, they were cautious about the prospects for ’06, largely because they didn’t see any obvious drivers for growth. With regard to current conditions, national labor markets appear to be solid.  Both of the temporary-help firms headquartered in our District reported that their business was very good.  Of course, they mentioned that it was softer in the Midwest, primarily because of the problems of the Big Three automakers and their spillovers and because of suppliers in the regional economy.  One mentioned that Michigan was the only state in which he had seen a drop in the demand for business and technical workers.  I mentioned last time that things could get worse if the Delphi negotiations result in a strike, and all three parties—Delphi, UAW, and GM—are talking.  Delphi has toned down its rhetoric, and the deadline has now been pushed back to February 17. Turning to cost and price pressures, wages and benefits continued to increase at a moderate pace.  With regard to other costs, I heard the usual concerns about prices for energy and energy- related inputs in shipping, but the reports about other material costs were mixed.  There was one interesting case in which capacity considerations were showing up in higher prices, and that’s the airline industry.  United reported that the reduced capacity in the industry has made it easier for them to raise prices, particularly when it comes to passing through fuel costs.  And, as you know, they are scheduled to exit bankruptcy shortly. As I mentioned in the past, I’m concerned about the high amount of liquidity circulating in financial markets.  For example, one of our directors who heads a major private equity firm noted that such funds were having no trouble attracting investors.  He said that the amount of new money invested in private equity firms is expected to expand 50 percent this year, and there is a slightly ominous look to some of the new investors, such as underfunded state pension funds that are “reaching for return,” as he described it.  Similarly, early last week we held our semiannual meeting of academics and local business economists, and I heard comments about unusually high liquidity levels from several economists who work for investment firms and commercial banks.  And as we all know, risk spreads are quite low by historical standards.  So I worry that there’s a lot of money chasing investments out there, and that this may have driven the price of risk down too far. In the national outlook, even with the weak fourth-quarter numbers we continue to expect that economic activity will expand at a solid pace similar to that in the Greenbook.  We see growth at or slightly above trend over the next two years and the unemployment rate remaining around 5 percent.  Of course, if the fourth-quarter sluggishness spills forward, we would have a more complicated set of issues to deal with, but I agree with the staff and expect that growth will bounce back this quarter.  With regard to prices, we think that core PCE inflation will average close to 2 percent over the forecast period.  The outside economists at our meeting last week generally agreed with this outlook, although a couple predicted that GDP growth would fall somewhat below 3 percent in 2006. Most of these economists thought that we would raise the fed funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent and then go on hold.  As always, we’re going to have to take a hard look at the data and forecasts before we decide what to do.  Inflation could moderate further.  We’ve been pleasantly surprised at firms’ ability to absorb cost shocks.  If they continue to do so, we could be looking at core PCE inflation rates heading down this spring.  In that event, inflation risks would be diminished, and there would be fewer risks in ending the current rate cycle.  But there’s a good chance that recent cost increases will pass through, and we’ll experience a repeat of last winter’s uptick in core inflation.  Moreover, I can see some plausible outcomes for growth that would pressure resource utilization.  And in that event, we’d be looking at a forecast for core inflation that was stuck above 2 percent.  I think this would be a problem.  With inflation remaining at such rates, we could begin to lose credibility if markets mistakenly inferred that our comfort zone had drifted higher.  When we stop raising rates, we ought to be reasonably confident that policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back toward the center of our comfort zone, which I believe is 1½ percent.  And as I read the long-run simulation in the Bluebook, it seemed to say that the funds rate needed to rise a bit over 5 percent by late 2006 to bring core inflation down to 1½ percent within a reasonable period.  So for today, we should move forward with an increase of 25 basis points, and we should allow ourselves enough flexibility so that policy can either stop or continue moving, as the situation warrants."
"151";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The surprise of the fourth-quarter GDP number and the slightly elevated inflationary pressure have caused us to take, I think, a closer look at the underlying strength of the economy.  And to an extent it is reassuring—certainly, the strength in industrial production and real personal consumption.  However, the risks that we have seen before remain and may, in fact, be slightly elevated.  The potential risk of increased oil costs and the pass- through effect into underlying core inflation is at least slightly heightened, and with the flattening of housing values, the potential effect on consumption remains slightly strong. It is often easy for us at these meetings to say we’ll have a clearer understanding at the next meeting of where we are; but although the next meeting answers this meeting’s questions, it also raises new questions.  However, in this instance, we may have more reason than not to make that point.  The January jobs number will be out on Friday.  If the initial claims number has any predictive power, we may see a strong report.  I couldn’t help but notice the juxtaposition of the initial claims chart next to the GDP number as an indication that it’s one that will be looked at carefully.  Also, given the magnitude of the change in the prior-period GDP, the revised GDP number for the fourth quarter may be much different from the preliminary number.  Also, between now and the next meeting, our new Chairman will be making a semiannual presentation to the Congress on the state of the economy, with an opportunity to be more definitive than we can perhaps be at this meeting. In conclusion, I suggest that we make the obvious move and raise our target ¼ point but not be any more definitive or predictive than necessary in the accompanying statement.  I support President Yellen’s suggestion for flexibility in our description today.  And I share with everybody else the honor of having worked with you for these four years that I’ve been here."
"152";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  What strikes me from my conversations with my contacts is the growing confidence that they do not see major risks on either side, that there are reduced standard errors around their projections.  Very few had comments or concerns about inflation outside of energy, which, of course, is on everybody’s mind. I’d like to make an analytical point that actually comes from my UPS contact.  I think I mentioned at an earlier meeting that UPS is moving its business off the mixed rail—the piggyback. That move is a consequence of the fact that the railroads are unable to speed up delivery times, which in turn is a consequence of the railroads’ decision that it is not worth the capital investment that would be necessary for what for railroads is a relatively low-yielding business.  UPS is also working to maximize the return on its own capital.  The company is very disciplined about adding capital and is planning to price low-yielding business out of its network.  That is, for the low-yield products, they’re going to raise prices expecting that the business will go away.  My contact at UPS said that he thought that the strategy would not really be successful and that they will probably be looking at substantial increases in capital spending in ’07, once they find that they have optimized their existing plant, that the volume doesn’t go away when they try to raise the prices on it, or that not enough of it goes away.  And I think that this phenomenon might be more general in our economy.  Companies are very disciplined about their capital investment.  But as the economy continues to expand, they’re going to run out of ways to optimize the existing capital plant, and we will see investment coming in stronger over the next couple of years.  That’s an observation that may have more general application. I support the Greenbook’s forecast, plus or minus a quarter of a standard deviation. [Laughter]  Not worth worrying about.  Instead, what I’ve been trying to do is to make lists—and these could be much longer—of risks on the high side and the low side.  On the high side, I would point to commodity prices, which are high and have gone up a lot, and growing strength—as I just commented—in business fixed investment.  I mention high money growth, because I don’t think that the rapid money growth is fully explained, and it certainly has frequently been a precursor of higher inflation. Some indicators on the other side—we talked about housing, the possible reversal of the unusually low saving rate, the behavior of the yield curve, the risk of oil supply disturbances.  Most of oil has been demand-driven, but supply disturbances because of the problems in the Middle East primarily—Africa as well—could certainly produce a significant downward shock on economic activity and upward shock on prices.  No doubt these lists could be amplified, and I think it’s probably worth spending more time thinking through the risks and how to respond to various events than it is trying to optimize the forecast and get that last quarter of standard deviation exactly right. Mr. Chairman, many around the table have commented about their experience serving here. I will, of course, echo those.  I would like to put a little different angle on it.  Of the people who have had a major impact in my life, you are certainly one.  I mark on the fingers of one hand the people who have had extraordinary influence on me.  You have influenced me mostly in my professional life but also in many aspects of leadership that go beyond economics and policy in a narrower sense.  So I thank you for that.  I am also looking forward to continuing to learn from you. I understand that you have some books, at least in your head.  And given my interest in making sure we have clear communication, I have a suggestion for a title for your first book.  And it is in line with some books by your predecessors.  So I suggest “The Joy of Central Banking.”  [Laughter] And I suggest that your second book be “More Joy of Central Banking.”  [Laughter]"
"153";"MR. SANTOMERO.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Consistent with the national economy, overall activity in the Third District slowed somewhat more than expected in the fourth quarter. Despite this slowing, the general view in my District is that our regional economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace in 2006. Payroll employment continues to expand in our three states, but at a more moderate pace than we saw in the first half of 2005.  Overall, market conditions remain firm.  The three-state unemployment rate ended up at 4.8 percent, slightly lower than the national rate.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The index of general activity in our manufacturing survey declined to plus 3.3 in January, its lowest level in seven months.  But the indexes of shipments, new orders, and employment were all up.  This divergence is unusual. Typically, they move together.  When they do diverge, I tend to put more weight on the shipments and new orders indexes, as these reflect the respondents’ own firms rather than the opinions about general economic conditions.  In addition, the fact that our firms have not yet changed their capital spending plans for 2006 suggests that their outlook remains positive. Retail sales in our District are rising moderately.  Retailers still express concern about the potential depressing effect of higher gasoline and heating costs on consumer purchases in 2006. Our auto dealers have not fared as well.  In fact, our District has seen a decline in automobile sales. Growth in construction is one of the question marks in the 2006 outlook.  In our District, nonresidential construction continues to improve.  In fact, the office market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and office vacancy is declining in both the city and the suburbs.  By contrast, over the past month or so, we have continued to receive anecdotal reports that a slowdown in residential construction may be at hand.  Real estate contacts report that house-price appreciation has slowed or even ceased, and there has been an increase in inventories.  These signs, however, seem to point to a softening of activity, not to a sharp drop. We have received some welcome indication of a moderation in price pressures in the District.  Our survey measures of prices received and prices paid were down in January and well below their October peaks.  Expected price increases also declined sharply.  The only caveat I would put on that statement is that the survey was taken before the most recent run-up in energy prices. Turning to the nation, the advance fourth-quarter GDP report was quite a bit weaker than we were all expecting.  That said, we, too, think it’s too soon to conclude that the weakness seen in the fourth quarter is more than a temporary soft patch.  Our forecast for GDP over the next two years is similar to that of the original Greenbook that we received this month.  We expect growth to be on average around 3½ percent, near potential.  We have a somewhat smoother path than the Greenbook since we expect the boost in activity from the rebuilding effort in the hurricane-afflicted areas to be more spread out than front-loaded. We also see somewhat stronger employment growth next year than the Greenbook because we see somewhat stronger output growth in 2007.  We project nonfarm payrolls to rise at an average of 160,000 a month this year, stronger in the first half as people displaced by hurricanes continue to return to work.  We project an average increase in payrolls of about 150,000 per month next year. The Greenbook employment projection is similar to ours in 2006, but the Board staff sees a deceleration next year to an average of about 100,000, as was pointed out in the presentation. However, our unemployment rate forecasts are similar, about 5 percent, because we see somewhat higher labor force participation. We anticipate core PCE to rise a bit less than 2 percent in 2006 and then to accelerate to 2 percent in 2007, reflecting a modest acceleration in unit labor costs.  In contrast, the Greenbook sees a slight deceleration in core inflation over the forecast period. Our forecast is predicated on being near the end of the tightening cycle.  Exactly where we stop is yet to be determined; the data will tell the Committee.  But all of these data suggest that we are closing in and we are close to being done.  For this meeting, I think it’s prudent for us to do what the market expects and make another move of 25 basis points.  But I think we also want to be in a position to pause if that is appropriate, given the incoming economic data. Of course, I will not be here for that interesting discussion.  [Laughter]  As you know, this is the last FOMC meeting that I will be attending as President of the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.  I am honored to have had the opportunity to lead that institution.  Of all the experiences during my six years of service at the Fed, none was more challenging and more rewarding than serving on this Committee.  I have enjoyed and learned from the first-rate staff of the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors.  I feel privileged to have served at a remarkable point in economic history.  In my tenure, we’ve gone through a recession and a recovery, seen concerns shift from disinflation to inflation, moved to a record low funds rate, and then returned it to more-normal levels.  And all of this was accompanied by an unprecedented degree of transparency in our policy discussions.  I have also been inspired by the leadership shown by our Chairman, I may add, in forging a consensus from diverse opinions in periods of uncertainty and in fostering a collegial atmosphere among us.  I want to thank you all for an important part you’ve played in making my service at the Fed a rewarding experience.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"154";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with one anecdote about housing activity in the District.  I don’t know how representative this is nationwide, obviously, but there are signs of slowing in both housing construction and, more dramatically, in sales recently.  And this winter in the Twin Cities, several hundred unionized construction workers are not working.  Last year 100 percent were.  But they’re all expected to be back at work in the spring, and that suggests to me—and this is more a question than a conclusion—that the ultimate correction in housing may occur later and be more severe than I was earlier expecting. As far as the national economy is concerned, like others, I am inclined to discount the fourth quarter.  I find the Greenbook story about the outlook reasonably convincing.  I personally think that we will see pretty good growth in both ’06 and ’07.  I tend to rely, as you know, on the underlying fundamentals and the resilience of the economy, and those things seem to me to be sound and in place.  And so I think the overall outlook is pretty good. I do think that there was a disconnect in the fourth quarter between the supply or output side and the demand side.  If you look at the numbers for employment and hours, you would have certainly come up with a stronger forecast.  Now, you may plug in a negative productivity number. That’s one way of reconciling it.  Maybe the November and December employment data will get revised down.  I guess that’s another way of reconciling it.  Perhaps some of the aggregate demand components will ultimately be revised up a bit.  But there does seem to be a disconnect there, nothing that I find all that troubling, but something I think worth bearing in mind if we want to think about the fourth quarter. I think the key to the outlook and to policy going forward, though, is inflation.  And I went and looked at what has happened to the core PCE over the past eight or nine years.  And the range of increases in core PCE inflation over that period was about 1¼ to 2¼ percent, and I think the average over the past eight or nine years was something like 1¾ percent.  I don’t cite those numbers just to prove that I can look them up.  I cite them because I would characterize that whole period as a period of low inflation, maybe something resembling price stability.  And if I ask myself, “Is inflation likely to break out on the high side of that range in the relatively near term?” my answer to that is “no.”  And I think most bond market participants, at least the way they are pricing things, would also answer that question with a “no.” Part of that is, of course, that we have been moving policy, and it seems to me that policy, measured by the real federal funds rate, is now certainly in the ballpark where it needs to be.  I anticipate that we’ll move again today, as I think we should, in part to validate market expectations. Is policy perfectly positioned within the ballpark?  Well, I don’t know the answer to that, but I do think it is well positioned within the ballpark, and I think we need to bear that in mind as we go forward."
"155";"MR. STOCKTON.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, I quickly consulted with my labor economist experts at the coffee break about your question about the demographic effects on the workweek, and, indeed, there is—and it’s incorporated in our forecast—a modest effect of the aging of the workforce on the workweek, with older workers having shorter workweeks.  Obviously, the longer-term trend has been driven more by the shift in the composition of employment from manufacturing toward more service-oriented industries, which have shorter workweeks, but there is a perceptible demographic effect as well."
"156";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When I was preparing for this meeting early last week, I was feeling very comfortable with the forecast of good growth in 2006, in the mid-3 percent range near potential, and a modest uptick in core inflation above 2 percent.  As many of you have already remarked, the GDP numbers on Friday made me slightly more pessimistic, both on growth and on inflation.  The surprise drop in government spending, I have full confidence will turn around. Final sales fell, however, so that all the growth that occurred in the fourth quarter came from inventory growth.  Given that inventory–sales ratios continue to run at historically low levels, though, inventories should continue to be a source of growth going forward.  As many of you also have noted, other indicators show much stronger performance.  Initial unemployment claims, goods orders, capacity utilization, and strong corporate balance sheets—all of them effectively say that we have a strong foundation underneath this growth.  The inflation numbers ticking up to 2.2 percent gave me a bit of pause.  We came through two good quarters, the second and third quarters, with very low inflation; but again, the uptick shows how much variability we see around the inflation numbers quarter to quarter and warrants attention. The one area—and I want to second Dave Stockton’s remark—of main concern is the housing market.  Let me talk about it a little differently from some previous comments today. When we look at the aggregate levels of debt that households have and relative prices, one of the things as an old lender I worry about is the ability to service the debt and the discretionary spending that households have.  While 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rate, 20 percent are variable. Starting in 2002, we saw a jump in ARMs, taking advantage of the very steep yield curve at the time.  We now are in a period when not only the fancy option ARMs, the exotic products of the past eighteen months, but also the 3/1 ARMs and the five-year ARMS that became very popular in 2002 and 2003 are repricing. If interest rates just hold where they are right now, we estimate that the monthly debt service cost is going to go up by at least 50 percent on that 20 percent of mortgage portfolios.  If you look at the Greenbook, you’ll notice that the financial obligation ratio rose quite substantially in the past six months.  It is now back to the peaks of 2001 and 2002, and we have a lot of mortgages still to reprice.  We also know that some of these exotic mortgages don’t amortize, but they will kick in and start amortization and that will also pull cash out of discretionary spending. In an overall look at consumers, with housing and the cost of heating this winter rising, you’re beginning to see a little caution in the borrowing numbers.  The drop in home equity lines of credit that I mentioned a meeting or two ago now has been sustained through the whole quarter.  So we have actually seen that home equity lines outstanding that have been drawn on have dropped. Consumer credit as a whole dropped, excluding mortgage credit, and mortgage growth as a whole slowed to just over 10 percent.  So households are signaling that they’re pulling back on new borrowing, not just in housing but in general.  When you look at the ability of consumers to spend discretionarily out of their monthly take-home pay, these are signals we need to look at.  And the rising fixed payments that they have is something, in looking at the tail of the distribution on housing market risk, that I think is important for that segment of the population going forward. The other sad thing is that this is our last meeting with the Chairman, and I just personally also want to echo some of the comments of my colleagues around the table to thank you for your leadership.  I’ve been very impressed with the kind of atmosphere that I found when I joined during your tenure as leader of this institution.  The integrity with which everything is done, your emphasis on the quality of ideas, and your continuing to search for new ways to look at information—because the economy is dynamic—remind us that we have to watch for new things always evolving.  The collegiality with which you have led this organization has made it enjoyable for all of us to be here. And finally, as an old risk manager, I was glad to feel right at home with your approach to monetary policy.  [Laughter]  So thank you for your leadership.  It has been a pleasure to have served with you."
"157";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There’s not a lot new in New England.  So I thought I’d just skip over my usual probably more-lengthy-than-necessary comments on the region. Let me just mention a couple of things, though.  Employment growth is still slower, and income growth is still slower than that of the nation.  Our regional unemployment rate went up rather than down over the past year, and we have seen some slowing in residential real estate markets. However, surprisingly enough, there seems to be a good deal of optimism in discussions we have had with people about business spending and about commercial real estate markets.  So, for the first time in five or six years, we’ve actually had net absorption of space, both downtown and in the suburbs.  That situation is making a big difference in the smiles on people’s faces around town.  I hope it means that New England is getting back and moving along the same trajectory as the nation. Turning to the nation, we, like most observers, were surprised at the modest growth rate of the economy in the fourth quarter.  But we, like almost everybody else, believe that the reduced pace of government spending and smaller-than-expected inventory investment that affected the fourth quarter are likely to be temporary and reflect issues of timing rather than overall economic strength.  Thus, we, too, anticipate a slightly stronger first quarter this year than we had before.  But our forecast takes the same basic trajectory over the balance of ’06 and ’07—that is, strength in the first half of ’06 and then moderation as the effect of tighter monetary policy, cooling housing markets, and less fiscal stimulus takes hold.  This is the same trajectory as that in the Greenbook. However, as we look at GDP, our forecast for ’07 is slower—½ percent or a little bit less— than the forecast for ’06, reflecting an expected outright decline in housing investment.  We also see inflation trending off both this year and next, with core PCE inflation never above 2 percent over the two-year period.  I mean, not “never,” which is a strong word, but at the points we’re mapping. Some of this difference in price pressures is accounted for by a sense of a somewhat greater supply of labor resources, as reflected in a slightly lower NAIRU and a higher labor force participation rate. Looking at these forecasts and assessing all the data and anecdotal inputs I have received since the last meeting, I am struck by a couple of things.  First, these forecasts, and the vast majority of those available from other sources, describe an almost ideal outcome.  U.S. demand is strong but slowing, as consumers save more and borrow less.  Fiscal stimulus diminishes, business spending remains solid, employment grows, inflation edges off, and foreign growth is spurred by domestic demand at last and acts to create some export growth, though we continue to have a widening current account deficit.  If these forecasts were to be realized, it would truly be just about the best of outcomes, and I would agree with President Yellen—a major sweet spot as the Chairman hands over the reins. But that scenario sort of begs the question of risks, both large and small, and how they are balanced.  We could certainly be surprised by new energy shocks or geopolitical events of such magnitude to cause financial turmoil and consumer and business retrenchment.  We could also witness the turbulence that could accompany a sharp unwinding of the nation’s ever-growing external deficit.  But you don’t have to focus on major upsets.  Risks of a lesser proportion loom as well.  We could very well be wrong about the remaining capacity in labor markets, and the resulting upward pressure on wages and salaries could create a more rapid pace of inflation, particularly given the solid pace of external growth and pressures on a range of commodity prices.  To date, however, the growth of wages and salaries has been on the slow side, particularly relative to productivity, and there is little evidence that firms believe they have the pricing power to pass on much more than energy surcharges.  Indeed, their profit margins suggest that they have a cushion against increases in input costs.  Alternatively, the impact of a cooling housing market could take a larger bite out of consumption than we now expect and cause a greater-than-projected, though welcome, increase in personal saving.  This would, of course, slow the economy from baseline and damp price pressures.  We haven’t seen this yet either, but it could be just as likely as missing on the inflation side. Thus, as I look at both the upside and downside risks, they seem to me to be more balanced than they have been.  As some evidence of this, both the Greenbook and the fed funds futures markets anticipate that policy is near a tipping point—move a bit more now and then retrench in late ’06 or early ’07. I also find myself beginning to wonder about the cost of being wrong.  When policy was arguably much more accommodative, it seemed to me that letting inflation get out of hand might be harder to deal with and ultimately more damaging to the economy than if growth slipped a bit.  That may still be true.  But just as our credibility regarding price stability is important in setting market expectations so, too, is some sense that policy will be supportive of growth when the threat of rising inflation is less imminent.  In short, we need to be credible about achieving both our goals.  At this point, another nudge toward a policy rate that neither stimulates nor restrains the economy seems appropriate.  But the need for further moves seems to me to be increasingly driven by the incoming data."
"158";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  By now I’m sure that most of you are tired of hearing me report that conditions in my District are not as vigorous as conditions in most of the country.  I know that I’m tired of repeating it.  Fortunately, optimism is increasing in many parts of my District.  My directors and business contacts that have national and international business interests report fairly solid conditions in most of their industries.  They tell me that they plan to maintain a strong pace of capital spending this year and that they expect healthy productivity gains from doing so.  These trends encourage me to think that our economy will be able to maintain the 3 percent rate of structural productivity growth that underlies the Greenbook baseline projection. Since we are nearing the point of monetary policy neutrality, I’m counting on a strong rate of productivity growth to help us gradually nudge the inflation rate back down over the next several years.  I have not changed my thinking about the underlying trends in the economy since our last meeting.  I was pretty much in sync with the Greenbook outlook then and remain so today.  The BEA’s fourth-quarter revisions appear to affect the timing of economic activity across a couple of quarters but not to affect the longer-term outlook. Even though I still expect to see headline and core inflation moderate over the projection period, I have become a bit more sensitive to the upside inflation risks in the baseline projection. First, in the Greenbook we received last week, the staff concluded that inflation this year could creep up a bit more than they had thought in December, and the staff elevated their estimate of core PCE inflation for the fourth quarter from 1.9 percent to 2.2 percent as a result of the most recent BEA report.  The staff hedged against that possibility by imposing a temporary 25 basis point surtax on their December fed funds rate path beginning at our next meeting, and it seems sensible to me to keep this option open.  At our December meeting I said that I thought we were very close to being able to stop increasing our fed funds rate target at every meeting.  I still think so.  If monetary policy is a combination of science and art, I think we’re now out of the laboratory and inside the art studio, and having flexibility as we go forward is highly desirable to me. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I have to admit that I’ve spent more time since our last meeting thinking about what to say in acknowledgement of your last meeting than I’ve thought about economic conditions, and it’s impossible to come up with words to express my feelings.  I just simply want to say that it has been truly an honor and a privilege to serve under your leadership of this Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"159";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data on economic activity, as summarized by the fourth-quarter GDP figure, have been surprisingly weak.  But there are good reasons to believe that much of the softness will prove temporary, so I tend to agree with the Greenbook and other forecasts in expecting a rather sharp rebound in the current quarter. That said, I want to sound a note of caution.  This view is based on incomplete data for the fourth quarter and a paucity of information concerning activity in the first quarter.  It is not inconceivable that the weak numbers for the fourth quarter could presage a more-prolonged, sluggish phase as the lagged effects of past policy tightening and higher oil prices take effect.  This caution is heightened by my concern that the economy faces some pretty big downside risks, especially having to do with the interrelated issues of possible overvaluations in housing markets and low term premiums in bond markets.  These risks are highlighted by the alternative simulations in the Greenbook concerning a rise in the saving rate and a higher term premium.  In summary, I see the Greenbook’s view of real activity for this year as very reasonable, but downside risks to that forecast give me pause. Turning to inflation, core PCE inflation over the past twelve months—at 1.9 percent—has come in higher than I would like to see.  But assuming that growth slows to trend later this year, my outlook for inflation in 2006 is more optimistic than the Greenbook.  One reason stems from work our staff has done on the extent of pass-through from energy prices to both labor compensation and core price inflation.  As I’ve said before, the evidence suggests to us that there has been relatively little pass-through since the early 1980s, perhaps due to the credibility of our commitment to the stability of core inflation.  Under our assumption of very little pass-through, we expect the core PCE price index to rise around 1¾ percent, both this year and next.  The Greenbook shows an increase of 2¼ percent this year, presumably reflecting larger energy-price pass-through, and then a drop to about 1¾ percent in 2007 as the effects of energy prices subside.  So though I differ with the Greenbook on inflation in 2006, over the longer period I think we’re about on the same page. So as I look at the total picture, I would say that the overall outlook is quite positive.  The economy is near full employment with real GDP tending toward trend-like growth.  Core inflation is within a reasonable range but a bit on the high side.  Needless to say, it’s fitting for Chairman Greenspan to leave office with the economy in such solid shape.  And if I might torture a simile, I would say, Mr. Chairman, that the situation you’re handing off to your successor is a lot like a tennis racquet with a gigantic sweet spot.  [Laughter] Positive though the situation is, it also obviously raises the issue of how much higher the funds rate needs to go to keep the economy on this desirable trajectory.  There are a number of ways of looking at this question, all yielding similar answers.  First, a funds rate of 4½ percent rests right near the center of the range of estimates for the equilibrium funds rate.  Along the same lines, our staff ran simulations of FRB/US to calculate the net effect of monetary policy actions over the past several years on real GDP growth.  The results are that, after adding importantly to growth over the last few years, past policy accommodation is roughly neutral in terms of growth this year and next. A second approach is to compare a funds rate of 4½ percent with the recommendations of Taylor- type rules.  Such calculations suggest that a 4½ percent funds rate this quarter is a bit on the tight side now but should be about right later this year under the Greenbook forecast.  The long-run simulations in the Bluebook are a third method to judge the stance of policy.  These simulations show the funds rate optimally peaking at a little over 5 percent, well above where we are now.  But a major factor accounting for this relatively high peak is the Greenbook’s assumption, incorporated in the Bluebook simulation, that energy pass-through pushes up core PCE inflation to 2¼ percent this year.  And as I’ve emphasized, we’re not convinced that this much pass-through is likely, and our lower inflation forecast implies a lower peak for the funds rate along an optimal path. Taken together, then, these approaches suggest to me that if we tighten policy at this meeting, as I think we should, we will be close to the appropriate peak in the funds rate based on what we know now.  As for the future path of the funds rate, I believe it should be highly dependent on unfolding events and cannot be prejudged with any degree of confidence.  So the bottom line is that we need to position ourselves for flexibility in our policy choices going forward."
"160";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060131meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, in the interest of crispness, I’ve removed a substantial tribute from my remarks.  [Laughter],   I’d like the record to show that I think you’re pretty terrific, too.  [Laughter]  And thinking in terms of probabilities, I think the risk that we decide in the future that you’re even better than we think is higher than the alternative.  [Laughter] With that, the economy looks pretty good to us, perhaps a bit better than it did at the last meeting.  With the near-term monetary policy path that’s now priced into the markets, we think the economy is likely to grow slightly above trend in ’06 and close to trend in ’07.  We expect underlying inflation to follow a path close to current levels before slowing to a rate closer to 1.5 percent for the core PCE sometime out there.  Relative to the Greenbook, we’re a little softer on growth in ’06 and a little stronger in ’07, but our inflation outlook is similar. The uncertainty around this forecast still seems considerable, perhaps more than the market has priced in.  On the positive side, consumer and business confidence still seems pretty high, with employment growth solid and compensation growth likely to pick up.  We think that household income growth is likely to be pretty strong.  Investment may be strengthening, and it could surprise us with more strength.  The tone of the anecdotal to us seems more positive, less cautious than it has been.  And just to cite our Empire survey, the six-month-ahead numbers show a fair amount of optimism.  Overall, financial conditions, of course, still seem quite supportive of continued expansion.  Global growth has strengthened.  And like the staff, the market seems to have looked through the negative surprises in the fourth-quarter numbers and priced in a bit more, rather than less, confidence about the strength of demand growth going forward. On the darker side, we have the familiar concerns about potential adverse shocks, energy supply disruptions, terrorism, et cetera.  But even in the absence of these events, we face a fair amount of uncertainty about key elements of the forecast.  The prevailing expectation of a gradual moderation in housing prices and a relatively small increase in the saving rate could prove too optimistic.  Private investment growth could slow further, productivity growth could disappoint, risk premiums could rise sharply.  And, of course, that could happen even in the absence of a major deterioration in the growth or inflation outlook.  But this, on balance, still leaves us with what looks like a relatively balanced set of risks around what is still a quite favorable growth forecast. The inflation outlook still merits some concern—I think modest concern—about upside risk. Underlying inflation is still somewhat higher than we would be comfortable with over time.  The core indexes are running above levels said to define our preference over time.  Other measures of underlying inflation are running above the core rates.  The behavior of inflation expectations at longer horizons has been reassuringly stable in the face of the elevated headline numbers, but the levels are still at the higher end of comfort.  With the economy near potential, unit labor cost growth should accelerate.  And, of course, although profit margins still show ample room to absorb more unit cost increases, their behavior suggests continued pricing power.  The strength of global demand, the continued rise in commodity prices, other input costs, and the latest increase in energy prices all suggest a possibility of further upward pressure. With this outlook and this set of risks, we believe some further tightening of monetary policy is necessary with another small move today and a signal that some further tightening is probable.  We’re comfortable with how the market’s expectations have evolved over the past few weeks and with the present forecast of perhaps one—maybe slightly more than one—move beyond today.  It’s hard, though, to understand why the market attaches so little uncertainty to monetary policy in the second half of the year.  And this underscores the fact that one of our communication challenges ahead is to make sure we convey enough uncertainty about our view of the outlook and its implications for monetary policy.  In this regard, I want to compliment the recent innovations to the Bluebook presentations and hope that they persist."
"161";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Any other questions?  All right.  We come to the first go- round.  Let me remind you that we’re going to focus in the first round on the economic outlook and will leave, I hope, the policy discussion until tomorrow. As you know, there has been interest in increasing the interaction in this round, so I have a few suggestions.  First, I will take the liberty of intervening occasionally and raising a question or asking for comment.  Second, and this is the risky thing, we’re going to allow two-handed interventions.  [Laughter]  If you would like to comment or ask a question about a colleague’s remarks, please raise two hands, and you’ll be recognized to make short remarks to be perhaps responded to.  This process may work too well.  [Laughter]  Therefore, I reserve the right to play traffic cop, and we’ll take the whole thing as an experiment and see how it goes.  Who would like to go first?  [Laughter]  President Moskow.,   Immediate recognition.,   Right.  For your turn in the round.,   If you would like to be recognized immediately out of turn, raise two hands; otherwise, one hand.,   Do you want to comment on the automobile industry in general and the prospects for production and prices?,   President Yellen.,   You address this a bit at the end, but how do you reconcile your optimism about core inflation with the view that you have increasing resource utilization and that it affects inflation?,   Thank you.  President Guynn.,   Thank you.  President Lacker had a comment.,   President Guynn, I wonder if you would say a little more about the Katrina rebuilding—why you think that’s going to be very slow.,   Thank you.  President Minehan.,   Thank you.,   Next meeting.,   Thank you.  Let me just highlight a theme that President Guynn and President Minehan both mentioned, which is that some of the tightest labor market conditions are for the most skilled workers.  It seems to me that normally in a business-cycle expansion the lower-skilled workers tend to benefit at least as much as highly skilled workers.  And I just want to raise this theme for the research people and for the other principals, to see if something is unusual here or if we’re just misinterpreting what is going on.,   President Fisher.,   Speaking of the largest hole ever dug in history, I wonder if you would have a view on the current account implications of some of this offshoring that you’ve been talking about.  Are you concerned about that?,   Thank you.  We have a timing decision to make.  We could take a break now and come back.  I’d like to propose that we stay in the meeting until 6:00 and, at that point, go to a reception and dinner.  We will probably not finish this round by 6:00, but there will be plenty of time tomorrow to do that and time to reflect.  Is that acceptable to everyone, to just stay in the meeting?  All right.  Well, let’s continue then.  The next person is President Stern.,   Thank you.  President Pianalto.,   You mentioned nonresidential construction, and President Fisher mentioned that.  I think the Greenbook was pretty pessimistic about the near-term prospects for nonresidential construction.  Is there some dissonance there?  [Laughter],   President Minehan.,   President Pianalto.,   President Fisher.,   President Hoenig.,   Thank you.  A number of people have talked about tightening monetary conditions.  President Yellen did.  Of course, long-term rates have not risen, so I guess there is a question here about the issue of how much is the term premium, how much is the change in the equilibrium rate.  I just put that question on the table because your views on it should affect whether you think conditions are essentially easy or tightening.  First Vice President Stone.,   Thank you.  President Lacker.,   And yet our behavior has to be consistent with the model, right?  We have to respond in a way that does, in fact, react to inflationary pressures.,   I’ll agree.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   Anything to report on co-op prices in Manhattan?  [Laughter],   Thank you.  Governor Bies.,   Do you relate the corporate preference for cash to caution, to risk aversion, and what implications would that have for capital investment?,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Thank you, Governor Kohn.  With apologies to those who have not had a chance to speak, I think we could adjourn now.  Let me just remind you that it is especially important, given that this is a meeting in some sense still in progress, that we maintain full confidentiality about the discussions we’re having in this room.  There is a reception and dinner on the Terrace level of the Martin Building, and I will see you there shortly. [Recess] March 28, 2006—Morning Session,   The meeting is reconvened.  We want to complete our go- round.  President Poole, are you ready?,   The comment and suggestion on nonresidential construction is very helpful, very interesting.  On the Wal-Mart wage increases of 1 percent—hasn’t Wal-Mart increased health coverage and compensation overall?,   Thank you.  Governor Olson.,   Did the banks comment on the yield curve; is it affecting them?,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Any two-handed interventions?  [Laughter],   Thank you.  I would like now to summarize these views and add a few comments of my own.  At that point, if there are additional comments or questions, they will be welcome. We have had, I think, a fairly upbeat group here the last couple of days, which is of course good, both in terms of views of economic activity and in terms of keeping inflation well controlled. The economy appears to be quite strong, but my sense is that most people feel that risks on that score are relatively balanced, which I take to imply that, after being strong in this quarter, growth will slow to something closer to a more-sustainable pace in the remainder of the year.  Perhaps the leading source of uncertainty on the output side is the housing market, but I was reassured to hear that most participants think that a decline in housing will be cushioned by strong fundamentals in terms of income, jobs, and continuing low interest rates.  The labor market is clearly continuing to strengthen, but I heard not too many concerns about increasing wage pressures.  There was some discussion about shortages of more highly skilled workers, which presumably might affect wages at some point but apparently has not so far; and there was additional discussion of productivity gains, which are helping to keep unit labor costs down and to support growth. On the inflation side, I have not been in this conversation for a while, but I was impressed at least relative to a year ago that the angst about inflation seems to have declined.  Clearly, inflation expectations are well anchored.  Margins are high, and the sense of the group was that pass-through to consumer inflation was likely to be limited.  Still, I took from the group some sense of at least a slight upside risk to inflation, reflecting the increasing resource utilization; the fact that inflation is somewhat on the high side of what many people describe as their comfort zone; and the fact that, if inflation does rise, there will be costs to bringing it back down and maintaining our credibility. So that is my overall summary of the Committee discussion.  My own views, you will probably not be surprised to hear, are not radically different from what we have heard around the table.  I would point out, first, that except for housing, the economy continues to be very strong. One might be tempted to average the expected rate of growth of the first quarter at about 4½ percent with the 1½ percent of the fourth quarter and say we’re at a pace of about 3 percent, but then I would remind you that we had 4.1 percent in the third quarter despite Katrina and about 3.7 percent average growth in the first three quarters of ’05. We have a strengthening world economy.  We have consumption that looks likely to be well supported by income and jobs.  Several people have talked about the strength of investment in nonresidential construction.  Job creation at about 200,000 a month is clearly above the long-run sustainable rate.  So except for housing—and that is, of course, a critical sector—it looks as though the economy is, if anything, growing more quickly than potential. Housing is the crucial issue.  To get a soft landing, we need some cooling in housing.  So far there is a good bit of evidence that there has been a peak, but we do not know a great deal more than that.  So obviously we are going to have to watch carefully.  The range of possible outcomes is quite wide.  I agree with most of the commentary that the strong fundamentals support a relatively soft landing in housing.  A pessimist might point out that the expectation of future price increases is itself an important part of the user cost of housing.  A sea change in people’s views about what is going to happen to house prices in the future might significantly affect their perceived cost of owning a house and lead to lower prices and to weaker activity.  On the other side, residential investment is, of course, only about 6 percent of GDP, and so long as consumption is well maintained by incomes, jobs, and other factors, I think it would take a very strong decline in the housing market to substantially derail the strong momentum for growth that we are currently seeing in the economy. What we might see in the next few quarters is some quarter-to-quarter variation.  We may not have the stability of growth that we have had the last couple of years.  If that happens, we should be willing to accept it.  I might offer a very rough analogy to the way we think about energy prices and core inflation.  With core inflation, our goal is to accommodate energy prices but to make sure that they do not get into the underlying rate of inflation.  Again, this might be a rough analogy, but if the housing market moves significantly, we should perhaps not try to upset that movement but rather just try to ensure that the resources that are released are deployed in the rest of the economy and that the rest of the economy remains on a stable path.  Again, I think we are unlikely to see growth being derailed by the housing market, but I do want us to be prepared for some quarter-to- quarter fluctuations.  So, broadly speaking, I agree with the Committee that we should see some cooling for the remainder of the year and that we should approach a more-sustainable pace of growth.  But I think there is some upside volatility risk, if you will, because of the fluctuations in residential investment. On inflation, like most of you, I am struck by how well behaved core inflation has been. Indeed, in 2005, core inflation was even slightly lower than it was in 2004, and we have all pointed to a number of explanations, including well-anchored inflation expectations, international competition, productivity growth, and since I wasn’t here, I can say good Fed policy.  [Laughter] One area of uncertainty in trying to look forward is unit labor costs.  Remarkably, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector grew only 1.3 percent in 2005, but as was already mentioned in the staff presentation, I think that understates the trend because it is coming off the surge in the fourth quarter of ’04 in bonuses, stock options, and other types of one-time compensation.  If you smooth through that bulge, it looks as though the underlying trend of unit labor costs is more like 1.7 percent, and perhaps that may have some upward bias.  There is certainly a lot of uncertainty about that, though. We have seen some indicators, such as average hourly earnings, rising.  Other indicators, such as the employment cost index, are slowing.  I just point this out as a significant source of uncertainty, given how difficult it is to forecast both compensation and productivity going forward.  So, again, the stability of inflation in the last couple of years is very reassuring. I would note, however, that over the past three years, since 2003, we have seen a pickup in inflation.  That was, of course, by design, but I think it is important for us to think about why that happened.  There’s something of an identification problem here.  To the extent that the increase in inflation over the last two to three years reflected the pass-through of energy costs and commodity prices, that is actually good news in a sense because, to the extent that those factors soften and flatten in the coming year, we should see some reduction in inflation in ’06 and ’07.  To the extent that inflation increases in the last two and a half years reflected increased resource utilization, the strength in the economy, and the return of pricing power, however, there is a bit of concern that we may see some additional updrift of inflation in the next few quarters. Like most of you, I am not at all alarmist about inflation.  I think the worst that is likely to happen would be 20 or 30 basis points over the next year.  But even that amount is a little disconcerting for me.  I think it is very important for us to maintain our credibility on inflation and it would be somewhat expensive to bring that additional inflation back down.  So my bottom line on inflation is that there is a very modest upside risk.  Again, I think it’s not a large risk but one that we probably should pay attention to. Are there any comments or questions to close our round on the economic outlook?  If not, we can move to the policy round.  In a moment I’m going to turn to Vincent to introduce the policy options in the statement.  Before I do that, I just want to note that we have left unresolved the discussion about the ownership of the statement—in particular, what we are voting on when we vote at the end of the meeting.  Currently we vote on the action, on the directive, and on the risk assessment but not on the rationale.  The rationale has, however, been largely a consensus paragraph worked out by the Committee.  My sense is that this decision is not entirely separable from a wide range of other issues we may want to talk about over the next few quarters concerning the content of the statement, its structure, whether we use forward-looking language, and whether we consider adopting some kind of numerical guidepost for inflation. And so what I would like to do, if it is okay with the Committee, is to maintain the status quo for today in terms of our voting in this statement.  By the next meeting, in May, I will come back to the Committee with a proposal for a process by which we can address this whole range of issues over a period of time, and on the top of the agenda for that process will be the ownership of the statement.  Is that acceptable?  All right.  Seeing assent, we will maintain the status quo on the statement just for today.  Vincent, whenever you are ready."
"162";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, like the others, I am grateful to be here under your chairmanship and also to be with the two new Governors who are on board.  I will spare you Texas hyperbole, with the exception of just saying that our District is growing faster than the nation and is pumping on all cylinders.  And I’m going to focus my comments on the CEOs and CFOs to whom I’ve talked, who have national and international franchises, as I am wont to do at these meetings. The situation is best summarized by one who said, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is.”  What he’s saying and what I’m hearing from almost every CEO and CFO I spoke to, from large and small companies, with the exception of the housing companies, is that they see surprising economic strength and no pricing power despite significant cost pressures.  And that strength is being projected not just into the current quarter but also into the second quarter. So let me start with the railroads, with Burlington Northern.  They reported that last week they shipped more units than in all but ten weeks of 2005.  And they have internally raised their forecast for shipments of consumer goods year over year for the second and third quarters, from 6 percent to 7 percent.  To quote their CEO, “It’s just blowing and going.” UPS, which is not in our District but I talk to them a great deal, reports a 6 percent volume growth based on last week’s numbers.  It’s consistent with what they expect for the first quarter, which is a number greater than 5 percent.  And, again, to use a direct quote, “I just do not see people pulling back.” On the retail front, to get to some of Dave Stockton’s points, the retailers at all price points are reporting that demand is strong and that “the tone of business is beating our expectations.” Wal-Mart and their brethren point out that a slowdown would manifest itself in a shift of disposable income to food purchases.  They are not seeing that.  To quote the CEO of that very large retailer, “We thought that there would be a drag from $2.50 gasoline, but it’s not happening.”  They expect 4 to 6 percent comps in April.  By the way, assisted by the late date of Easter, a lot is being shoved into March and then some is being carried through into April.  The person I talk to there is the CEO of their U.S. operations, who is not given to overstatement.  I had never before heard him say that “demand is amazing,” but that’s what he said in our interaction this week.  At a higher price point, we talked to, for example, the CEO of JCPenney.  He said, “We would expect to be running double- digit declines at this point, but we are seeing positive numbers with great strength in the Southeast, the South Central, the West, and also, by the way, the Northeast, which is overcoming weakness in the Central and Midwest geographic areas.” At the last FOMC meeting, I reported concerns of a major manufacturer of drinks, juices, food products, and snacks, based on the gloominess of what he heard at the grocers’ convention in Phoenix.  He now reports that they are less worried and that their concerns have lifted.  And this CEO, whom I would put, Mr. Chairman—using a Winnie-the-Pooh analogy—in the Eeyore category, always sees the glass less than half full.  [Laughter]  Maybe because he’s in the drinks business, I’m not sure.  [Laughter]  He described the economy as “ticking along” and added that, as I quoted earlier, “It shouldn’t be this way, but it is.” Kimberly-Clark, another interesting company, which is quite open with us, is a supplier in a different sector of the market.  They report that “despite everything the consumer has been hit with, demand continues to chug along.” As for the semiconductor companies, Texas Instruments has a book-to-bill ratio right now of 1.11.  That is, orders are coming in 11 percent faster than they’re going out.  In the semiconductor industry, a book-to-bill ratio of 1.05 is considered strong.  And they are presently front-loading their capital expenditures from the third quarter into the current quarter in order to meet demand. The other Eeyore to whom I talk suffers from a genetic challenge to being optimistic—he’s a Norwegian.  [Laughter]  He also happens to be one of the larger ship operators in the world, about whom I have reported at previous meetings in terms of the imbalance of supply that’s coming on stream and the demand for that supply.  He reports that “there is much more demand growth than expected.”  And you see that growth reflected in the large bulk carriers, the Panamax carriers, which are the most liquid part of the market, where prices, as I reported last time, had gotten down to $14,000 for a daily rate and are now back up to $17,000.  The container fleet is also holding up, with some change of utilization from the transatlantic shipment to the transpacific shipment.  But as he says, “These markets have legs.”  And he characterized the overall sense of the economy with a very Zorba-the-Greek type of summary of events:  “Demand side is stronger; tanker market is holding up; container market growth is strong.  In short, no catastrophe.” On housing, for which you find the most negative outlook, I have just a couple of comments.  I spoke to two of the five largest housing CEOs.  What they and their competitors watch for is the home cancellation rate—that is, when a buyer puts down a minimal amount as downpayment, which is now down to $1,000, on a home and then walks away.  The average home cancellation rate has run about 22 percent in modern history.  Right after September 11, 2001, it spiked to 28 percent.  It is presently running at 32 percent for the national builders.  So, clearly, housing is a not very happy area. Everybody I talked to reports continued emphasis on cost containment and on re- engineering their production functions.  One of the large chemical companies reported that they used $11 gas to fix all their boilers and production facilities:  “Everyone in the chemical industry is wringing everything they can out of overhead and operations.” So I decided to follow that subject further down the supply chain and talked to the CEO of Anadarko, one of the largest natural gas operations, who happens to be on our board.  They, too, are trying to control costs by centralizing their purchase operation.  They purchase about $3 billion a year, and they expect to drive down costs at the same time in order to finance a massive capital expenditure expansion, which you would expect to be driven by the high prices that they experienced recently.  Wal-Mart has put in a massive one-time enhancement of inventory management, which is pinching suppliers but is providing them with significant savings in dollars. All the companies reported continued interest in building their offshore interests—again, to drive down the cost of operation.  And I thought it was interesting that as Mike Duke, the CEO of Wal-Mart International, was leaving India the other day, Michael Dell—a good Texas company, Dell—got off the plane at the same time and announced that they are going to create jobs for 20,000 new employees in India.  One of the largest securities houses reported that they had sent one of their most senior officials four times in the past nine months to India to figure out a way to drive down the analytical costs by having corporate spreadsheets and other things done there before they’re presented to the decisionmakers for their buy-side analysis and their sales-side analysis.  The CEO of Kimberly-Clark gave me a remarkable number.  He had just come back from India.  They are looking to fill 9,000 jobs.  They received 1.4 million resumés in English.  A Dallas director who is a venture capitalist reported that they will no longer consider providing capital in a second-round venture capital financing unless the company has a foreign component for offsetting costs.  Finally, one of our directors in El Paso, a woman who manufactures accessories in Mexico, has decided to move her Mexican operations to inland China to save on costs.  My point is that this appears to be now part of our corporate DNA in terms of trying to drive down or contain costs.  Again, as the CEO of Wal-Mart said, “This is not just an issue of low labor costs.  It’s an issue of effecting enhanced profitability.” I want to end with a comment of concern in terms of my own District, with regard to construction.  If you look out the window of our offices in Dallas, you’ll see twelve gigantic building cranes.  It almost looks like Shanghai, and this is old downtown Dallas.  And I’m reminded of the comment that was made by one of my predecessors, Bob Boykin, at this table when he was bragging about the fact that Caroline Hunt, in building a project and a hotel—where you’re going to stay when you visit our District—had managed to dig the largest hole ever dug in history.  And your predecessor, Mr. Volcker, said, “Are you speaking figuratively or literally?”  [Laughter]  I don’t know where this will lead, Mr. Chairman.  I do sense that, on the anecdotal side, final demand is much stronger than the econometrics would tell us.  My gut tells me it will end in tears, but we’ll talk about that tomorrow.,   I am concerned.  I worry particularly because I think—and I’d have to get the numbers, but I’m virtually certain—that the shift is taking place particularly in currencies that don’t adjust to the dollar.  India has just announced that they would open the rupee and open their capital account.  The Chinese clearly do not have a free-trading currency. And at the same time, just to show my bias—Janet is going to be very disappointed in me, I think—I subscribe to Winston Churchill’s approach to trade, which is if someone else—I won’t use his exact vernacular—wants to take advantage of their taxpayers and subsidize their production and provide it cheaply for us, we should take it, add value, and capture the majority of the profits.  So I think we are doing that.  I think there are limits as to how far we can run on the current account deficit.  I also expect that eventually the market will correct for that.  But we’ve been talking about that for a great deal of time.  Last year, we worried about the dollar’s strengthening rather than weakening.  And I subscribe in part to what President Poole argues:  The question is how long you continue to attract capital. Just one more comment on that front, and this is why I asked the question about the Polish zloty and the New Zealand dollar.  One of the things I am concerned about, Mr. Chairman, is that my investment instincts tell me, as we raise rates here and as the yield curve perhaps shifts upward—and perhaps someday at the longer end of the yield curve—that there will indeed be a greater desire to invest in high-quality, risk-free credit like that of the United States and to withdraw capital from some of these lesser, marginal credits.  So there might actually be a short-term effect by which we are encouraged and emboldened by greater capital influence rather than lesser capital influence.  My overall instinct is that we’re postponing the pain and the correction and it’s further out there.,   Mr. Chairman, in terms of what we see outside our window at our Federal Reserve Bank, it is almost all condominium construction.  The joke is that you want to be the fourth owner of the building that is being constructed."
"163";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share the view of most that the slow growth in the fourth quarter of last year was, in fact, a temporary aberration that will be offset by strong first- quarter growth in the neighborhood of 4½ to 5 percent.  Auto sales have already bounced back, and defense spending is unlikely to continue declining.  And business investment spending looks to be strong.  Like most outside forecasters and the Greenbook, our Atlanta BVAR and DSGE models are projecting that GDP growth will be around 3¼ percent or so in the second half of 2006 and into 2007.  Our models also have core PCE inflation holding between 1¾ and 2 percent and the fed funds target rate peaking at about 5 percent. Although I would characterize this outlook as solid, and even encouraging, some significant uncertainties and risks surround the outlook.  I’d like to comment on several of those risks and, in doing so, include some observations from our region’s experience and contacts that seem to be relevant. The first set of uncertainties in my own mind revolves around how the residential real estate adjustment will unfold—something Dave and Janet have already talked about.  Although the decline in construction and sales and the slowing in price appreciation seem to be orderly so far, there clearly could be a more disruptive set of changes that we do not now foresee.  As I reported at our last meeting, we are now seeing some significant downward price adjustments and cancellation of some major condominium projects in our red-hot, speculation-driven coastal Florida markets.  At the same time, other markets are seeing more-modest adjustments, and it appears that builders are cutting back in response to demand signals.  I don’t mean to imply that a major pullback in real estate would cause a precipitous drop in economic growth—that would be inconsistent with most of our simulations and analyses.  Yet growth in that sector could slow even more than we now expect, especially if mortgage rates should continue to increase.  Adding to the unknowns with regard to residential construction is the timing of the kick that will be associated with Hurricane Katrina rebuilding.  The Greenbook has built in a measurable near-term contribution from that reconstruction, but I continue to believe that we’re going to be surprised at how protracted that rebuilding is going to turn out to be. That brings me to a second concern—our admitted uneasiness with how well we can explain the behavior of long-term interest rates in this cycle, something we talked about earlier but have not done so much recently.  Despite the new academic look that I’m working on, [laughter] I don’t think I can add any genius to the possible explanations already offered by the current and the past Chairmen, Vice Chairman Geithner, and others.  But I was here at the FOMC table for the heyday of the so-called new economy, when we thought for quite a while that we could explain some significantly different behavior, some important elements of our economy, only to learn in hindsight that some of those phenomena turned out to revert to past relationships and past experience. Clearly, an unexpected uptick in the long-term rates, including mortgage rates, would not come as a complete surprise.  It would affect both household and business spending.  I see it as a risk that we should be careful not to dismiss too quickly. The two uncertainties I’ve just talked about represent downside risks to output.  There’s another development that I think tends to offset those downside worries.  Job growth has been strong; in fact, in our region we are hearing more and more reports of shortages of new workers in a number of industries and with certain job skills.  At the same time, much has been made of stagnant wages for some workers.  My staff has analyzed data on the wages and on the types of jobs being created relative to those being destroyed and has found that, although the wage dynamics did deteriorate between 2001 and 2003, wage relationships have since returned to historical norms. Moreover, business surveys from both the National Association for Business Economics and the National Federation of Independent Businesses suggest that, although firms put a lid on wage increases during the 2001-04 period, the net projection of firms that are raising wages has become more widespread, and it is now about the same as it was during the 1990s.  This rebound suggests to me that wage growth from net job creation is now lending more support to spending than it has in the recent past, taking some of the pressure off other sources of funding, such as home equity extraction. As our recent post-FOMC meeting statements have indicated, upside inflation risks also remain.  It’s still not clear to me that we’ve seen the full long-term adjustment by households and businesses to elevated energy prices.  I continue to hear reports of more energy and other commodity cost pass-throughs that people would like to make, and reports of rollbacks of earlier energy surcharges are few and far between. Although I’m not a proponent of the NAIRU way of thinking about the relationship between unemployment and expected pressure on inflation—a relationship that is hard to see in any recent empirical data—we do need to watch more carefully than ever for new bottlenecks and price pressures in a solid expansion that is now four years old.  In fact, even though I see that the risk at our current and expected policy setting is getting close to balance, as a good central banker I remain at least a bit more concerned about the potential for inflation to edge somewhat higher.  I will not argue tomorrow for a significantly tighter policy to help push the inflation rate moderately down, within the range most of us have said we view as our objective.  But I do not think we want to risk a higher level of inflation at this point and risk having inflation expectations begin to deteriorate. I believe the kinds of uncertainty that I’ve just talked about demonstrate that our reading on the path of policy and the proper policy setting over the period ahead has become more difficult to get just right and more difficult to explain.  And I think that suggesting that future policy action will be determined by the evolution of the economic outlook lends credence to the spirit of the recent post-meeting statements.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back.,   Mr. Chairman, the more times we visit there—we’re going to take our full board down in May—and the more people we talk to, our sense is how dysfunctional that whole area still is.  The state government still hasn’t got its act together.  You may have read that the mayoral race in New Orleans has twenty-three candidates.  I just can’t begin to sense how they’re going to get either state government or local government operating, especially with the new hurricane season coming up.  Everything we see and hear from the field suggests that, until people come to grips with what the new flood-plain maps look like and what the building codes need to look like, there will be very little real construction going on.  It’s still mostly cleanup.  And although we’re getting some construction in Mississippi, where they seem to be further along, the bigger area that is yet to come is in New Orleans.  It looks like a ten-year proposition rather than a two- or three-year proposition.  And I can’t work any better numbers than the staff did here, but I suspect it’s going to be strung out over a really long time."
"164";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A couple of things, first, on the region.  Like the nation, our region continues to grow at a fairly robust pace.  But one of the questions we kept asking in our discussions was whether it was strong but leveling out, or accelerating.  I think, for the most part, the consensus is that it’s strong but leveling out.  Turning to just a couple of examples, manufacturing activity did expand in February and, we think, in March on a preliminary basis, but at a somewhat slower pace than in January and even in December for us.  Production and new orders rose only modestly in the February and early March period.  Housing activity, as others have discussed, has shown some signs of leveling off, although it is still high by historical standards. Residential construction has edged down in most areas of our District, and builders to whom we’ve talked expect further easing in the months ahead.  I think it is important, too, that home sales are showing little or no growth, with high-end sales softer than most of the other segments in our markets. Just to mention commercial real estate, it has actually improved somewhat in our region. Vacancy rates have continued to edge down in the Denver and Kansas City areas, so we have seen some pickup in activity.  Energy activity continues to expand very rapidly, despite shortages of labor and equipment throughout the western part of our region.  In some of our Rocky Mountain communities, concern has increased that the energy boom will drive away some of the other core business because of the costs of labor, land, and houses—it is really a boom environment there. I will talk quickly about inflation in our area.  Wage pressures, in fact, remain mostly subdued.  We have seen some backdown in wholesale prices, although retail prices have edged up. Manufacturers reported to us somewhat slower growth in raw material prices so far this year compared with last year.  However, I would say they are also concerned that they cannot pass price increases on as they work through the process. Let me just say one thing on the auto industry in our region.  I talked with one of the largest retailers-dealers in the region, in Denver—actually, he goes into Texas and some other areas.  He told me that in just the first two weeks of March they’ve seen a general slowdown in some demand for their products, both domestic and foreign.  But he said that, obviously, the domestic market is really suffering greatly.  In fact, he has seen other dealers refuse to take inventory from the domestic auto dealers, which gives him real concern about that industry going forward. Turning quickly to the national outlook, I agree that, for the most part, it is very positive.  I think that in the first quarter, maybe the first half, we will see a strong GDP number, perhaps as high as the Greenbook has indicated or even higher, which will then move back down toward the trend rate of growth over the course of the year.  Like President Stern, I think part of this in the first quarter and first half is reflective of a couple of things.  One is the bounceback from the year-end. Another is the last effects of accommodative policy that we had in the previous year, because a lot of money is still searching to be deployed right now but is beginning to be used up.  And for the first time in a while, I’ve heard more and more businesses talk about the prime rate.  I haven’t heard that in four years.  They are much more sensitive to it.  They’ve seen it go up, and now they’re negotiating around that, which I think tells you that some of the catch-up in terms of the policy effects of our past moves has begun, and I think you’ll see more of it in the coming months and quarters."
"165";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since the last meeting, as many of us have remarked, we have seen stronger domestic demand and a little less core inflation than expected.  To a degree, this extends a pattern.  In looking at the Greenbook chart on the evolution of the staff forecast, I was struck by the steady upward drift since last fall of projected growth in 2006 and 2007, coupled with flat to downward movement in projected inflation for those years.  Now, much of the 2006 growth was shifted from 2005, but the unemployment rate at the end of this year and next is lower than it was projected last fall—without any more, and maybe even a little less, price pressure projected. One possibility is that we are seeing a smaller effect from higher energy prices than anticipated, at least on inflation and perhaps on demand as well.  Since we expected the effect of energy prices on growth rates of output and core prices to be temporary in any case, this sort of information should not deflect us from our underlying view that growth is in the process of slowing to trend, holding underlying inflation roughly stable. The cooling of the housing market is the main impetus for a slight moderation in growth.  In this regard, although the incoming data on housing have been distorted by unusual weather and subject to considerable noise, I judge them on balance to lend added support to the sense that activity and price increases are softening, albeit to an unknown extent.  I agree with President Stern that an orderly cooling of these markets with moderate effects on growth is the most likely outcome, but we just do not know yet.  Rising inventories, declining new home sales, downward movement in building permits, and a drop in mortgage applications—all point to an appreciable drop-off in the demand for housing.  In the staff forecast, residential construction flattens out this year and next, after contributing nearly half a point to GDP growth last year.  Logically, softer demand should also be reflected in prices.  Unfortunately, data for prices are even harder to read than those for activity, but the recent monthly information on existing and new home prices seems consistent with the March slowdown in the rate of increase of these prices, which should feed through to wealth and consumption.  And we probably haven’t seen the full effect of the rise in short-term interest rates on housing demand, particularly for those who are liquidity or income constrained.  Mortgage rates have also picked up somewhat this year, and they are at the upper end of the range they have been in for the past several years.  So we could see some of the long-term mortgage rate effects as well. It is possible, of course, that the damping influence of the housing market could be offset by greater strength elsewhere, and two logical contenders are exports sparked by stronger growth abroad and business investment.  We have seen another in the series of upward revisions to foreign growth in the current Greenbook, but we have also seen greater tightening of monetary policy get built into financial markets, offsetting some of the increase in the strength of demand abroad. Moreover, the dollar has risen on balance, reducing the feed-through of higher demand abroad to purchases from U.S. producers.  Business investment looks robust, albeit a little less so after Friday’s data on orders and shipments.  If housing takes something out of consumption, however, prospective sales growth will not be quite so strong, and this will constrain the increase in investment demand. So, on balance, I see a moderation of growth to around the rate of increase in potential as a reasonable expectation, given the structure of interest rates built into markets.  The key question is whether such a path for output will be consistent with low, stable inflation. I think we can be encouraged by the recent data on prices and compensation.  Core consumer and inflation measures have been flat or declining on a twelve-month basis over the last six months or so, despite the uptrend in energy prices.  And inflation expectations have remained quite stable on balance.  Compensation measures are a bit more mixed.  The broadest measures, ECI and total compensation, have not picked up despite the erosion of purchasing power implied by higher energy prices and despite good trend productivity growth.  In this regard, Mr. Chairman, we do see an increase in average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers.  Maybe we are beginning to see some of this feed-through to workers on the lower end of those wages.  But, overall, I think compensation growth has been very well behaved. To be sure, we have not yet seen the effects of the recent increases in resource utilization, decline in the unemployment rate, or rise in capacity utilization—and these feed through to inflation pressures with pretty long lives.  Given the flatness of the Phillips curve, it could take some time to perceive the inflationary effects if, indeed, the economy is operating beyond its sustainable potential.  Moreover, the staff is looking for a notable pickup in compensation.  The unit labor costs this year and next are partly absorbed by smaller markups.  At this point, however, given the recent data, I would judge these potential developments to weigh on the side of upside risks to inflation rather than tilting the most likely outcome. Both compensation and price increases have fallen short of model projections in recent quarters.  While the less-than-expected effects of energy prices could explain this more favorable relationship of output and inflation, we can’t reject the hypothesis that we are seeing something more fundamental developing, especially on the supply side of the economy.  Recent data suggest it is not an unexpected increase in productivity.  Some combination of the lower NAIRU and the anchored inflation expectations alternative simulations in the Greenbook or other factors could be holding down wages and prices.  It is far too soon to say whether anything is going on or to tease out the policy implications, but we would do well to remember just how wide those confidence intervals are, how little we know about price and output determination, and especially how little we know about the level and growth rate of potential GDP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"166";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  I received the same advice that Kevin did.  [Singing] “To dream the impossible—”  [Laughter],   Obviously, from the remarks that we heard earlier today and yesterday, there is an enormous amount of strength and resiliency in the economy.  Clearly, the economy has rebounded from a temporary slowdown in the fourth quarter.  The specifics that I have heard from each of the Districts confirm the broad Greenbook view that this is going to be a pretty strong quarter.  I particularly like the quotation from President Fisher that it will be “blowing and going” during this quarter.  A forecast of 3¾ percent real GDP growth for 2006 with perhaps a bit of slowing in 2007 seems quite reasonable given the data that we have in hand.  Consumption remains solid, and despite some less-sanguine reports at the end of last week about some orders, business investment still appears to be reasonably strong. Since there seems to be much agreement with the central tendency of the forecast, rather than review my reasons for supporting it—and I support most of the reasons that people put forward—what I want to do is focus on a few potential risk factors going forward.  Not that I necessarily think that these things are likely to happen, but as Dave Stockton mentioned yesterday, there are a number of uncertainties in the forecast, which we need to focus on:  First, with respect to housing; second, with respect to energy and commodity prices; and, third, with respect to expectations in the yield curve and the term premium issues that the Chairman asked us about yesterday. We have been receiving some mixed signals with respect to the housing market, although the components that tend to have the most information for assessing the future direction of the market, permits and sales of new single-family homes, suggest some considerable cooling from the very hot period in 2005.  The evidence that I have from talking to property developers in the Chicago area and a bit in D.C. seems to be consistent with this evaluation, particularly in things like the condo market.  We see a lot of slowing there, particularly in the Chicago area—at least from what I have heard anecdotally.  Not only are we faced with the forecaster’s typical dilemma of trying to predict a trend break or a turning point, but we also have relatively few experiences in the United States over the last few decades of a downturn in the housing market.  So the key concern is going to be the effect on wealth and on consumption and obviously also on the construction market. In the Greenbook, I believe the direct contribution of wealth to real PCE growth was approximately 1 percent in 2005, and the forecast is about ¾ percent in 2006, with at least half of each of these increments due to housing wealth.  So, obviously, we have to be very sensitive to the concerns there.  In some countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, even some relatively moderate downturns or slowdowns in the housing market seem to have been associated with some fairly important GDP effects. President Stern yesterday made an important point of what’s driving what.  Many of the discussions about the housing market suggest that there will be some sort of exogenous shock that somehow may send the housing market down, as opposed to the housing market’s being part of the broader economy in which there are consumption demands for investment and in which houses are an asset as part of a portfolio.  It is important to put housing in that context.  In the other countries where we have seen downturns and GDP effects, it is hard to pull out what part was due to housing’s lead as opposed to housing’s just being one of the factors affected by a general economic downturn.  So with those caveats in mind, and obviously we have to be careful about extrapolating from other countries’ experiences, I do think we should be mindful of the potential risks that are there. Second, energy and commodity prices:  So far we have been very fortunate in seeing little, if any, of the run-up in energy and commodity prices feeding through to core measures of inflation, and from what I can tell in the discussions relating to the Greenbook, this has been a bit of a surprise to the staff and a bit of a surprise to the Committee.  Now, this may well be due to a confluence of very fortunate factors that perhaps could be reversed in the near term, or it may be due to some longer-run changes, which President Fisher discussed.  We had some discussion of this yesterday. So, as you know, productivity growth and international competition could be important factors, but at this point I do not feel that I understand enough whether this situation is just temporary and we are lucky or whether it is part of an ongoing process.  And so I think we just have to be mindful of the potential risk there.  And obviously with the uptick in forecasts for growth outside the United States, which could be associated with an increase in demand for energy and raw materials, further upward pressure could be put on those prices. Finally, inflation expectations in the yield curve and term premiums:  Fortunately, generally the market-based and survey-based measures of inflation seem to be fairly steady, reasonably well contained.  I share Kevin’s concern that some of these expectations being above 2, 2½, even in some cases closer to 3 may be a bit of a challenge, but broadly the numbers that we have been seeing around 2 seem to suggest that inflation expectations are well anchored.  And it seems that one of the great achievements of this body that I have now been very fortunate and very honored to become part of is the reduction of inflation uncertainty and the reduction of inflation expectations. And these reductions, I think, help us at least in part to understand the very low term premiums that we have been seeing in the United States. But we must also recognize that we have been seeing lower real and nominal rates and generally lower term premiums around the world.  In talking to market participants, I hear much less of a fear of an inflation spike in many countries around the world—not that there was a fear of an inflation spike in the United States—but I think a greater certainty about the direction and focus of the FOMC and a greater trust is extremely important. This gets back to a point that President Lacker made yesterday about the incredibly important role of expectations.  What we do has to be seen not just in terms of the traditional backward-looking role of thinking about how the higher cost of capital could affect choices that people make, but also about our credibility in going forward.  Choices that we make may have opposite effects on interest rates than what we have seen in the past.  Raising interest rates in the short-term may have a damping effect rather than an increasing effect on longer rates. If you look to forecasts of economists outside this room and the System, you also see a fair amount of optimism, suggesting growth in the future.  So the lower real and nominal rates in the longer-term markets do not seem to be due to concerns about significant slowing of the economy but to differences in views about inflation uncertainty and the level of inflation going forward.  So, particularly since some of our measures—of core PCE, core CPI—are at or toward the upper end of the range of where I would feel comfortable (and, I believe, from what I have heard, a number of others around the table would feel comfortable), we have to be vigilant about that.  Maintaining our credibility and the good work that this Committee has done is something that I want not to become dreaming the impossible dream but something that is the reality and that we can continue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"167";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Yes.  I apologize.  I haven’t learned the gestures yet.  [Laughter]  I didn’t practice them before the meeting.  President Yellen, I wanted to ask you two things, and they’re related in my mind.  What’s your understanding of why the pass-through correlations declined in the mid-1980s?  And second, if the interpretation has to do with policy, to what extent is that empirical and natural rate relationship you were discussing earlier structural?  That is, to what extent do different policy rules affect its slope and position?,   I agree with everything you’ve said.  That’s my hunch about why that pass- through correlation fell as well.  But then, in principle, shouldn’t an improvement in expectations about policy have the capacity to make that relationship between resource utilization and nominal inflation relatively flat?,   Okay.,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While we had some softer readings on our District’s economic performance early in the year, recent measures have been noticeably stronger. Our survey results from March have come in since the Beige Book, and they show continued strength in service-sector revenue growth, along with a sharp rebound in shipments, new orders, and employment for the manufacturing sector.  The retail sector, in contrast, has been weaker in February and March.  Some of the weakness is in furniture and may reflect cooling housing markets.  However, other retailers suggest that they are still experiencing givebacks following the extraordinary sales growth they saw in January, and many remain optimistic about sales prospects going forward. Several District businesses we talked to plan to increase investment in the months ahead. Their plans include not only computers and technology but also factory machinery.  Labor markets in our District seem to be getting tighter.  In January, Districtwide unemployment stood at 4.1 percent, and we hear scattered reports of shortages of skilled workers, as you mentioned earlier, along with some complaints that worker shortages are constraining production.  I had heard occasional references to worker shortages in past months, going back into last year, but this chatter has picked up noticeably in recent weeks.  Not only have the number of reports increased somewhat, but some now come from outside the traditionally strong urban areas.  We’re hearing it now in the manufacturing-dependent Carolinas, for example. Price growth measures moderated in our March survey results.  District businesses report that input price increases slowed, but they continued to express concerns about future cost pressures. Our respondents also reported slower growth in their output prices, and this was broadly based across all sectors we survey.  In addition, expected price increases for the next six months generally lessened. Our regional economic indicators on production, employment, and price pressures seem broadly consistent with the national picture.  The data point to a strong rebound in GDP growth this quarter, perhaps stronger than had been anticipated by the Greenbook and private forecasters. While household residential investment is slowing, business investment and spending appear to be strong, suggesting that firms are adding to capacity in anticipation of healthy demand growth.  The prospects for income growth, driven by continued employment gains and respectable growth in compensation, give me some confidence that overall consumer spending should hold up well, even as housing market activity moderates. Inflation has come in a bit lower than expected, and I’m increasingly comfortable with the idea that we’ve gotten beyond the risks to inflation presented by the shock associated with last year’s hurricanes and run-up in energy prices.  Core PCE inflation averaged 2.3 percent from August through November but has averaged 1.8 percent from November through January. Although market-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations rose briefly last fall, they soon subsided and have remained steady since.  So while I’m not entirely sanguine about the inflation outlook, I think the immediate risk of pass-through has probably passed us by. Looking back over this episode, and how we and many others feared that things might have unfolded, I think it illustrates the challenges we face in trying to understand inflation dynamics.  As energy prices rose sharply last fall after the hurricanes, the fear was that a sustained increase in core inflation and inflation expectations would work its way through the economy in the first half of 2006.  This bulge now appears to have been small and short-lived. A common approach to forecasting the effect of energy-price shocks on core inflation is to rely on relationships estimated over historical periods that include seemingly similar episodes.  Such an exercise implicitly treats the empirical relationship between energy prices and core inflation as structural, as in models in which wages or prices are set in a backward-looking fashion.  But as President Yellen and others have emphasized, this relationship is not stable in the historical data.  It has largely disappeared since the late 1980s.  This underscores the pitfalls of forecasting inflation based on a backward-looking approach that relies on pass-through correlations or, for that matter, Phillips curve correlations between measures of slack and inflation.  In contrast, to the extent that price-setting is forward looking, these correlations must embed expectations regarding our policy behavior and so will not generally be stable across changing policy regimes. This perspective suggests that the limited magnitude of the pass-through from last fall’s energy-price shocks was influenced by the public’s confidence that we would focus on preventing broader inflationary spillovers.  In other words, we may have gotten less pass-through than we feared because we were more credible than we realized, and the public’s behavior was more forward looking than we thought. Again, this is not to say that I’m complacent about inflation.  The initial response to last fall’s shocks embodied expectations of a lower path for the funds rate and a greater rise in inflation. Fortunately, the combination of communication by FOMC participants and the Committee’s steady actions appears to have brought these expectations back in line. I bring all of this up because in the months ahead we are likely to see tighter resource utilization if the Greenbook is correct, and we will be concerned about the extent to which that would put upward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.  So the question of the extent to which inflation dynamics are backward looking or forward looking is going to be front and center for us.,   That’s right.  It’s just that I’m always struck in episodes like this at the difficulty of taking advantage of historical correlations without taking a strong stand on how the public expects us to conduct policy."
"168";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  President Guinea Pig right here.  [Laughter]  The two hands are for comments?,   And one hand is just for recognition.,   Okay.  No clarification questions.  [Laughter],   Okay.  Well, most of my contacts this time were upbeat about current conditions.  Though the Midwest continues to underperform the rest of the nation, the U.S. economy seems to remain on solid footing.  So we tried to assess whether the strength in January and February was just a transitory bounceback from the fourth quarter or whether it represents some persistent forward momentum.  And while a few contacts expressed concerns about higher energy prices and softening housing markets—as we were just discussing—most pointed to an economy with substantial staying power.  A bit of good news is that the Chicago purchasing managers’ index, which will be released on Friday, will show a significant increase—from 54.9 to 60.4. The persistent momentum in the economy appears to be creating some pressure on resources.  One example is the airline industry.  Business and leisure travel are at very high levels, with strong bookings for the past few months.  Load factors are at near-record highs, in part reflecting a reduced capacity in the industry.  There continue to be more reports of fare increases, and surprisingly the increases are now being led by the low-cost carriers. We’re hearing about tightening labor markets.  Manufacturers continue to have difficulty finding skilled workers.  In the temporary-help area, Manpower—headquartered in our District— said that wage growth is accelerating nationally.  Three months ago wages were basically flat on a year-over-year basis.  Now they’re expecting increases of 4 to 5 percent in the second quarter of this year.  Kelly Services, also headquartered in our District, reported steady nationwide increases in the 3 percent to 4 percent range.  But both companies noted that labor markets were still nowhere near as tight as they were in the late ’90s. Speaking of labor markets, to update the GM–Delphi–UAW saga, Rick Wagoner, General Motors’ CEO, thinks that the GM buyout plan will take the heat off the poor Delphi–UAW relations, lessening the chance of a strike there.  He expects a significant number of GM and Delphi workers to sign up for the plan.  This will allow them to reduce the size of their workforce more quickly.  One aspect of this agreement that parties are not publicizing widely, for obvious reasons, is that GM and Delphi should have more flexibility in hiring temporary workers and outsourcing in the future.  The temporary workers will have lower wages, and they won’t have the full GM benefit package. Turning to the outlook, I feel that the near-term risks to the forecast have changed somewhat since our last meeting.  On the growth front, I had previously thought that high energy prices and sticker shock from heating bills might damp spending substantially.  And on the price front, I was concerned that pass-through of higher energy prices and other costs could boost core inflation and feed through to inflation expectations.  Neither risk has materialized so far.  Private domestic demand appears to be growing at a solid pace.  The recent price news has been favorable, and inflation expectations have moved little. So what are the risks now?  I do not see many immediate downside risks to growth; to the contrary, I personally think that the risk may have tilted to the upside.  It’s true that housing appears to be moderating, but the softening seems to be happening much as we expected it to.  In contrast, consumption growth continues to be quite strong.  This may be a signal that households are more confident about their permanent income prospects, perhaps because of healthy labor markets and the strong underlying productivity growth.  If so, then we could be in for some continued robust consumer spending.  In addition, growth abroad has improved.  Notably, Japan and Europe are showing some life.  Thus, we could see more demand emanating from abroad.  So in the short term, growth will likely exceed potential.  But given a funds rate path like that in the Greenbook, which I would characterize as a touch restrictive, my outlook and the Greenbook’s get growth back to potential by 2007. Despite the recent good readings on inflation, the current strength of the economy is showing through in our simple indicator-based forecasts of inflation.  We run about two dozen forecasting models that encompass common statistical indicators of future inflation.  These are not structural models.  They are simple regression forecasting models that use only current data, and they have no explicit conditioning assumptions regarding future policy, oil prices, or other such factors.  And this contrasts with a more structural methodology like the FRB/US model.  Nearly all of these indicator models predict some uptick in core inflation over the next two years—not a big one but to something a bit above 2 percent in 2007.  Looking ahead, these projections would probably move down with a further string of good news about prices and more-balanced prospects for resource utilization.  Nonetheless, given the models’ forecasts and the fact that we currently are operating with very little resource slack in the economy, I see a risk that inflationary pressures will be somewhat greater than what is currently built into the Greenbook.,   Well, I think that, on the production side, the Big Three producers have slowed down somewhat for this quarter and next quarter compared with last year.  I think the sales outlook for the industry is really pretty good.  You know, it’s about 16.5–16.6 million for light vehicles.  And the big issue, of course, is the shift from the Big Three to foreign producers, which is shifting output from the northern part of the Midwest to the southern states.  So that’s the big, big news in our District.  In terms of the contribution to the overall economy, I don’t see any real concerns here in ’06.  On pricing, they say that they are trying to cut back on the discounts that they have been giving, and they have cut back somewhat.  But I think the proof will be in the pudding as we get into this year as to whether they can continue that."
"169";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparation for today’s meeting, I talked with the CEOs of three banks—one major money center, one major East Coast regional bank, and one major West Coast—that pretty well have the markets covered.  There have been times when those conversations have either been directionally or substantively at odds with, or maybe ahead of, our Greenbook and our preparation data, but not this time.  The conversations pretty well corroborated or were consistent with both the Greenbook and our flow of funds data.  They all reported that, into ’06, consumer loans remain strong with good prospects for growth.  Asset quality remains very good, above levels that historical experience would suggest they could maintain.  Interestingly, we had that message a year ago, that asset quality was better than what they thought they could maintain through their normal credit review process, and that situation continues.  Commercial lending continues to be solid for both large and small borrowers, but the utilization of credit lines still remains at about 50 percent.  So it means that we are moving up from a very soft commercial loan market and may, in fact, be consistent with what President Poole suggested. This comes back to a question that President Hoenig raised yesterday.  The markets are much more concerned with event risk than with inflation risk—which is to say, issues like major energy disruptions, terrorism activity, or even weather-related activity.  This means that risk avoidance tends to be, to a significant extent, related to geography or market segment. Two particular areas struck my contacts and, therefore, me as being unusual and worthy of comment.  One of them relates to a significant change in the market for initial public offerings, and this particularly came from the West Coast.  The expectations for start-ups, particularly tech start- ups, are much more stringent on the West Coast.  A couple of years ago, a very good idea could generate a significant IPO experience, but now a good idea plus five years of solid cash-flow experience might result in half the level of an IPO that they would have had fairly recently.  The venture capital side of the business notices that very significant change.  A start-up today is much more likely to end up being an acquisition candidate than an IPO, and the reason for that may be varied.  Part of the reason might be caution, but a lot of it is being attributed to the additional regulatory burden, particularly the Sarbanes–Oxley regulatory burden. In the money center, the liquidity in the market is provided significantly by the institutional investors, and the activity on the loan side is to a great extent in structured credit.  The collateralized loan obligations and the collateralized debt obligations are providing a lot of that activity.  One significant change that is sort of consistent with the IPO experience is that, in many cases, internationally active businesses are more apt to go offshore for either debt or equity and do it as a private placement rather than do it in the United States.  Also, the banks that are active internationally can follow the flow either through a direct transaction or through some sort of a collateralized arrangement that can provide the financing, so an international customer has a distinct advantage in doing business with an international bank. An overall reflection on the economy:  Consumer activity remains strong, but flattening of real estate equities will certainly restrain the wealth effect on consumption to some extent.  In the so-called bubble markets, we are clearly seeing prices drop.  In the mortgage business, the purchase mortgages are very active, but refinancings are almost entirely eliminated.  There is a significant disparity between U.S. and offshore markets in terms of regulatory reporting requirements, and that is becoming increasingly apparent and has become a factor in both credit and equity issuance. Notably there is a significant absence of concern expressed about inflationary pressure:  None of the three CEOs expressed concern that they are feeling the effect of inflation.  Thank you.,   We did not hear much comment.  I expected to hear much on the yield curve, but I did not have any specific comments."
"170";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Okay.  Mr. Chairman, it is a great delight to see a 200 percent increase in the number of beards around this table.  [Laughter]  Half of that was in my point forecast, and the other half was not.  [Laughter] The contacts that I’ve talked to recently are very optimistic about activity—with one exception, which I’ll start with.  My contact at a major trucking firm said that he sees what he called a little bit of a slowdown.  Volume is essentially flat year over year across all regions and products. He doesn’t have an explanation, but he’s the only one of my contacts who had anything negative to say about the situation. My contact at UPS had some interesting comments.  He said that both UPS and FedEx together have their networks operating at a higher level at this time of year than they have ever seen and that, at the fourth-quarter peak, they will not be able to meet demand without some new strategies.  In particular, they’re going to use pricing and incentives, I guess, to try to reduce some demand that is less profitable.  They will be working with customers to ship stuff out on Sundays that previously went on Mondays, that kind of thing.  But he says that, unless they do that sort of thing, he anticipates that they will be unable to meet demand in the fourth quarter.  Of course, they talk with their customers all the time, and they’re very optimistic.  They have had very good earnings statements, as you may have seen. My contact with Wal-Mart said something that I thought was very interesting, which I’m going to try to explore in more detail.  He said that their wages, and these are for hourly workers (possibly just for sales associates), are absolutely flat—no increases whatsoever in the last year and no increases planned going forward.  Individual workers are getting some increases, which probably average about 1 percent, as a consequence of seniority.  They have a pay scale by which workers are paid more after they have stayed there some months—I don’t know exactly how many.  And I think they also have some productivity or performance bonuses built into their pay structure, but the structure has not changed at all, so wages are increasing about 1 percent year over year.  He said that about 20 percent of their associates are part time and that they are going to be increasing that share to 40 percent so they can staff at peak times and get more productivity out of their workforce. On a national basis, the main thing I’d like to comment on is construction, and I’ll start with a local story.  There is an absolutely tremendous boom in nonresidential construction going on in St. Louis.  As a consequence of our own building project, we have close contact with the construction industry in St. Louis, and our people received a spreadsheet listing of projects in the city.  I will start with the bottom line and give you some examples of the kind of thing that is taking place.  The average St. Louis construction volume is $600 million to $700 million a year in nonresidential construction.  Now, listed in this table are multiyear projects, some are two- and three-year projects, starting last year and this year.  The total here is $5.681 billion.  It is probably several times over the normal annual volume in St. Louis.  To give you some examples, there’s $930 million worth of casino projects, including casinos and some casino hotels.  So we’re building casinos.  I guess in Dallas they’re building condos.,   Well, Washington University has $200 million worth of projects. Reconstruction of Interstate 64 through the city is $500 million.  A cement plant, $800 million, is being built south of St. Louis.  There are hospital projects that add up to about $525 million, waste water treatment plants, $165 million, and a whole slew of other things here.  I do not think there’s anything on this list that is multifamily housing.  This is all nonresidential.  I have a suspicion that we have much stronger nonresidential construction in the works than is visible to us.  If you think about our formal statistical process, we do not really pick up much of that in advance, and I would recommend that the staff put together a special Beige Book survey next time, trying to get an idea of what sort of contracts or expectations are out there.  The architects know it.  The companies all know it.  But we don’t have that information collated, and I think it might be very helpful. I note also that the housing industry is very visible, and there are reports almost daily of guesses about softening in that industry.  A lot of the resources, such as cement and labor, are perfectly interchangeable between residential and nonresidential construction.  So we may find with the visibility of the housing industry that the market will read some signals of a softening economy in the construction area when, in fact, there is a tremendous amount of “stealth strength” that we are not observing that is coming from the nonresidential side.  I noticed that in the Monday pre-FOMC briefing you had a special discussion of business fixed investment in general, and I think that was focused on equipment and software and not on the construction side.  But I’m guessing that we have a lot more strength in the works than appears in front of us.  My UPS contact said that they are expanding their Louisville hub facility.  Let’s see what the total was—something over a billion dollars that they are going to spend in expanding their Louisville hub. I would say one other thing.  On the inflation issue, firms don’t say very much about their own price increases except when they have problems passing on cost increases.  They may complain about some of the cost increases they’re seeing.  We do not hear very much of that.  We hear a bit of it, particularly regarding fuel, and we still get health insurance costs.  Except for that, we do not hear very much, but I think we are going to have to ask very explicitly in order to extract from firms what they are doing on their own pricing front because it is not something that they naturally volunteer.  All their own price increases, of course, are fully justifiable and sensible, and only the cost increases that they are having trouble absorbing are a problem that they would bring to our attention.  Thank you.,   Yes, this is the straight hourly wage.  They do have some benefit cost increases.  I think that, in their budget, they are expecting 7.8 percent over the course of this year. They have been changing the structure of their benefit programs.  And the other thing that my contact there said, although I didn’t talk to him about it this time, is that they’re observing lower utilization—that is, apparently they believe that a lot of the low-wage demographic, as they put it, is somewhat stressed.  They see that in their own sales in terms of the kinds of things that people are buying.  They say that there is a lot of strength at the upper end of their demographic and weakness at the lower end, but their own labor force is using health care less intensively than before, perhaps because of the pressures from absorbing energy-price increases and that sort of thing.  So the copays that they are charging—the deductibles—are enough to reduce the utilization.  That is why the outlay they are expecting is up only 8 percent.  I am sure that the cost per unit delivered is rising more quickly than that, but there is lower utilization."
"171";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I see little in the latest information on the District economy or data on the national economy that gives me undue concern about prospects for sustained economic growth.  Turning first to the District—as is frequently the case, overall it is performing much like the national economy.  The expansion is broadly based, employment is growing, while the usual labor market churning continues.  Sectors such as manufacturing, mining, and energy are particularly strong at this point.  Some job skills, particularly in health care, accounting and auditing, technology, and the energy sector, are in short supply.  Consumer spending overall is well maintained, and nonresidential construction activity appears to be improving. Housing activity is a little more difficult to summarize.  Construction remains strong; sales are still relatively substantial, as best I can determine; and inventories of unsold properties are rising as well. Turning to the national economy, I said earlier I wasn’t particularly concerned about the outlook, but I really should put it more positively.  It seems to me that the current state of the national economy and its prospects are both quite good at this point, consistent with growth this year of 3½ percent or perhaps even more.  I’m impressed by the employment gains that we’ve seen, sustained income gains, and so on, and remind myself and others that, as the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated, the economy is certainly capable of long periods of uninterrupted expansion. I thought I would comment a bit more on two issues in particular—one is housing—where I wonder if the significance of potential developments might not be being exaggerated a bit.  I certainly agree that changes in housing prices, up or down, feed into household wealth and through that into consumer spending.  I think that’s a perfectly acceptable story.  So if housing prices go down or level off, they will have that effect on wealth and potentially on spending.  But there seems to be a view that, in some sense, an exogenous pronounced decline in housing prices is possible, maybe even likely, and that this could be more devastating for the economy.  It’s not that I would quibble with that story, but I would wonder about its likelihood because it seems to me more likely that housing is the tail rather than the dog in this.  That is, as long as employment continues to go up, incomes continue to go up, and mortgage rates remain relatively moderate, then I would expect that we would avoid severe difficulties in housing except for a few markets that are particularly inflated at this point.  Putting it the other way around, only if overall economic conditions deteriorate, with employment declining and income growth slowing or declining and so forth, would I expect there to be more broadly based and more-severe problems in housing. The second issue I’d like to spend a little time on is the inflation outlook.  The question I asked myself is, How likely is an appreciable acceleration of inflation at this point, particularly in light of the steps we have taken to get the federal funds rate back to a reasonable range?  First, I would argue that inflation expectations remain very well anchored at this point.  I don’t hear, as I go around and talk to various groups and meet with various business people, any doubt among the participants about the Fed’s ongoing commitment to low inflation.  And I think most of the available data support that.  One of the things I was looking at was a chart of one-, five-, and ten- year rates of core PCE inflation.  And when you look at that, you see that the ten-year rate of inflation has been declining steadily and now is a little below 2 percent.  The five-year rate has basically the same pattern.  It leveled off in about 2000, but it, too, is a little below 2 percent.  And, of course, the one-year rate of inflation, although it bounces around a lot more, ends up at about the same place, also a little below 2 percent.  And I just don’t have a sense that there has been any unhinging of inflationary expectations at this point. Another topic that I would comment on only briefly is the issue of lags in policy.  That is, presumably the full effects of the actions we’ve already taken have not yet been felt. Finally, we have looked at some forecasting equations that try to incorporate the growth in the money supply in particular and to forecast core PCE inflation.  I wouldn’t claim a lot for the quality of these equations.  I wish I could, but I can’t.  But for the most part, these various equations provide forecasts that are very close to the Greenbook forecast.  Inflation might be a little lower this year or might be a little higher this year, but they show very small changes for the most part.  My view is that the Greenbook inflation forecast is a pretty good one.  Like President Yellen, I originally submitted a number of 1.8 percent for inflation this year, and I don’t see any reason to change it at this point.  Thank you."
"172";"MR. STOCKTON.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Well, in fact, we’re forecasting a recovery.  We’ve been forecasting a recovery for the last year and a half that hasn’t happened yet.  I actually don’t view us as being terribly pessimistic in that regard.  We’re forecasting an upturn after a long period of disappointing, sluggish performance on that side.  So I guess I’d characterize our forecast as somewhat optimistic relative to where we’ve been over the past two years.,   That’s actually in state and local construction spending.  It’s a different component.,   Actually, it has been an area that has improved as well.  So the one part in which we haven’t seen much yet has been the office building side.  And that is an area where our forecasting improved, so I was actually a bit relieved to hear of some cranes out there. [Laughter]"
"173";"MR. STONE.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back.  And welcome to the new Governors.  First, I’d like to make a couple of comments on the region before I talk about the national economy.  The Third District didn’t see a fourth quarter as weak as the national economy, nor is our first quarter as strong.  But we’re seeing solid growth, which our indicators tell us will continue at current rates for the foreseeable future. Payroll employment is a particular issue in our District.  With the benchmark revisions that were made, our employment growth has been stronger than we originally estimated.  Our three-state unemployment rate fell to 4.4 percent in January, and businesses report an increasingly difficult time finding qualified workers.  Indeed, more than half the respondents to a special question on our manufacturing survey said that they were having trouble filling openings because of the lack of qualified applicants.  That’s an increase from 40 percent when we asked that question two years ago.  Firms report the greatest difficulty in finding production workers and computer-savvy employees, but I would go on to point out that one of our directors, who heads a temporary employment agency, has been reporting for the past two years a continuing difficulty in finding workers with even limited skills to deploy. Manufacturing in our area continues to expand at a moderate pace.  After a temporary dip in January, the index in our survey has rebounded to the level consistent with last summer, and that level is consistent with moderate expansion in activity. Retail sales in our District are rising only modestly, but retailers tell us that weaknesses in February were weather-related and that they expect a pickup in April.  Demand for nonresidential office space in the District is growing, and that’s unusual for our market.  The office market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and the office vacancy rate is declining in both the city and the suburbs.  We had some office building in the last couple of years, which is the first office building we’ve had in downtown Philadelphia in a decade.  We are seeing a few signs of modest slowdown in housing markets, with permits, home sales, and mortgage lending softening in recent months. Finally, we have received some further welcome news of moderation in price pressures in the District.  Our manufacturers’ survey measures of prices received and prices paid have fallen sharply over the past two months.  Expectations of future price increases remain subdued, and several respondents told us that, in their view, input price pressures have settled down and that their inflation concerns have subsided. Turning to the national economy, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline.  All signs point to a strong rebound of growth this quarter, after the temporary weakness in the fourth quarter.  Employment, business spending, and manufacturing remain strong, and consumer spending continues to increase at a solid pace.  There are emerging signs that the housing market is beginning to cool off, but no signs of a sharp retrenchment at this point.  The economic fundamentals remain solid, and after the rebound this quarter, we expect growth to settle down to a range of 3 percent to 3½ percent, near potential growth.  The economy is expected to remain near full employment, with labor markets tight.  We expect hourly compensation growth to accelerate somewhat over the forecast period, but not dramatically. Now, in my view, the risks to growth are roughly balanced.  A sharper decline in the housing market than that built into our forecast poses some downside risk, but it’s also possible that housing will not turn down as much as or as soon as forecasted.  The extent to which we see an improvement or further deterioration in exports is another risk that could go either way.  In fact, there appears to be a considerable divergence of views on the path of net exports among private- sector forecasters. In my view, the inflation risks are tilted somewhat to the upside.  It’s true that the data on core inflation and inflation expectations and our own recent decline in survey measures of prices paid and received are encouraging.  The acceleration of core inflation at the end of 2005 has been reversed in the first months of 2006.  So far, firms have had a remarkable ability to absorb cost shocks via new-found productivity gains, and increased global competition has limited their pricing power.  Both have helped keep inflation in check.  On the other hand, oil prices remain at high levels and continue to be volatile.  The ability of firms to maintain low pass-through in the presence of continued higher costs is a question.  With inflation running near the top of the range that I consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of resource utilization, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge.  Several times in the past we have seen core inflation quickly rise by a sizable amount when the economy was operating at high levels of resource utilization following periods of accommodative monetary policy, even when oil prices did not rise sharply.  So in my view, the inflation risks remain at least moderately on the upside, even though the recent data have been benign.  That said, on the whole I think the economy and the economic outlook are very positive.  Thank you."
"174";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to everyone around the table.  I think Governor Kroszner and I share the view that people have been incredibly kind and supportive in teaching us the ways of this institution in the past weeks.  So we certainly appreciate that.  I know I do.  The only advice that I was given last night that I will not take is that they say that Governors at their first meeting should sing their opening remarks.  [Laughter]  I thought it was a joke, but I guess that we’ll test it here.  [Laughter] Allow me to offer just a few perspectives consistent, I think, with a lot of the discussion yesterday and maybe some particular focus on business investment.  As was discussed, the economy appears to be stronger, but as I think about the economy today versus over the last several periods, what strikes me is how much more well balanced it is than it was over recent periods.  The equity markets, the credit markets, and certainly the anecdotal information that I’ve gleaned in my several weeks here and before, all tend to confirm that view.  And although there are meaningful risks to the economy, my own view is that there is a greater upside potential for growth than expressed in the Greenbook. A few notes about the consumer before I spend the balance of my time on business investment.  First, the consumer appears to be strong, as we discussed yesterday.  And my own sense is that, while there may well be softening in the residential market, staggered repricing of adjustable-rate mortgages and perhaps potential sales of a very novel, new housing product—the thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage—[laughter] may simplify things, particularly if the shape of the curve keeps its current trajectory.  Second, I would expect there to be, as I think the Greenbook referenced, accelerating household income growth and perhaps new job creation more robust even than was described in the Greenbook, particularly if some of the productivity gains that we have seen over the past several years tend to moderate. Let me spend a few more moments now on the business capital expenditure side.  My own view is that the strength of business capital expenditure in property, plant, and equipment may well surprise to the upside.  I think what we saw earlier in this recovery, both anecdotally as well as in the data, was a growth in cap-ex by a lot of the small and medium-sized businesses.  And as one CEO said to me a couple of weeks ago, big company CEOs have now gotten that memo. Opportunities to drive profit margins through productivity improvements appear to be diminishing somewhat, and so there appears to be a tendency, a greater willingness, to go back to the well and to get cap-ex back up to speed.  Two obvious indicia of greater cap-ex—which we’ve seen for some time and that would have suggested to many of us, including me, that business cap-ex would have ramped up sooner—are, of course, the strong corporate profits and these corporate balance sheets that are in remarkable shape. What I would like to spend a little time on is, well, what is new?  What is going to make cap-ex grow over 2006 above and beyond the projections to this point?  And so, as I talk about two other catalysts, I would suggest that they are not really reflected in the data yet.  But my own sense is that we should see them or at least there is a greater probability of seeing them in the balance of the year.  Of course, current regulatory and enforcement issues are still consuming significant CEO time and significant director and officer time, and that does tend to cast a rather deep shadow over these cap-ex budgets.  What we are going to find in this proxy season is an occupation or preoccupation, both in the business press and in some boardrooms, with the ongoing fight over majority election of directors.  There will be fights in boardrooms, fights by institutional shareholders, and a whole range of op-ed pieces about how these directors get put on boards and whether the system should be reformed.  Obviously, the current environment and the fight over shareholder democracy still tend to cast a bit of a shadow.  So I guess the question really is, what’s different now? I would note two catalysts.  One is CEO confidence.  I think Governor Bies yesterday referred to this in a couple of the surveys.  CEO confidence—that look in their eyes, their view of the animal spirits—appears to be back in stronger measure than I at least have heard in some time. What then happens when CEOs go into the boardroom, as I think most of my colleagues around the table know, is that they tend to generate some excitement by directors themselves.  Directors are really starting, in some regard, to go back to basics.  One CEO said to me about a week ago, “Being a board member is starting to be fun again,” and that is not something this particular CEO, who is on a lot of large-cap boards, would have said a year ago.  I don’t think he was referring to the days of going to the golf course in the middle of the board meeting.  What he meant by the board’s being fun again is that board members are focused on where the company should be going.  How should they be growing their business?  Should they be more vested on the mergers and acquisition side? Should they be more focused on capital expenditures?  And so from that CEO and from many others, we are hearing far fewer complaints about Sarbanes–Oxley.  It does not mean that the complaints are not there, but my sense is that most of these companies have now been able, at least, to put a box around their compliance burdens.  They have been able to check that box, go through their 404 controls once or twice, and though they still do not like it, the burden is no longer consuming their minds when they come to the boardroom. I think what we are going to see in the balance of 2006 are board members coming back to boards as “strategic advisers,” with a somewhat diminished role for board members as “compliance officers.”  And that is a good thing with respect to cap-ex because the more they are focused on their businesses, the more they are focused on helping companies grow.  I think that such focus is probably incrementally quite positive to a decision about investing the next billion dollars in property, plant, and equipment.  So looking outward, I sense that companies are seeing bigger and bolder opportunities, and that situation is a necessary precursor to understanding whether or not these cap-ex numbers increase. The second catalyst that I note may be a touch more controversial—how outsiders are looking at companies.  I guess the way I would say it is not that the barbarians are back at the gates but that they are gathering.  When you look at the private equity world, the leveraged buyout world, and the emerging hedge fund world, the “outsiders” are now looking at each other in a series of alliances and are starting to look with a keener eye toward corporate America.  They probably have seen the excess cash and, frankly, the conservatism of boardrooms and the conservatism of companies borne in the past five years and are willing to “think the unthinkable” and take greater advantage of that opportunity. I think Governor Olson made reference to the IPO market, which is really telling us many of the same things—whether a company that is public has, all of a sudden, a new interest in going private or an IPO candidate is saying, “Really, what is in it for me?  Why should I enter the capital markets?  Might we make better use of our time and attention by staying private, by growing cash flow that way?”  Another reason that the IPO market is not as robust as perhaps it would have been in previous periods like this relates to research.  You have to be a very big and very bold company to be getting large, bulge-bracket firms writing equity research and explaining your company to a greater pool of shareholders.  For an IPO candidate or even for a public company that has been around awhile with a few billion dollar market cap, getting that kind of research and that sort of investor base is much harder to do than it was in the years before Sarbanes–Oxley. Another item I have considered is merger and acquisition backlogs.  The backlogs that are on file by the largest investment banks and merger advisers are bigger now than they have been in the past six years and maybe even before that.  The difference in the backlogs this time versus in previous years, I think, is how much is really private equity.  It looks as though, in broad numbers, about a quarter to a third are private equity investors, LBO investors that are looking at companies that, because of size or background, they would frankly not have spent as much time looking at in years past.  You have a range of LBO players that are now back, and they are now describing themselves as shareholder activists and corporate governance experts.  But twenty years ago they were there, and they were focused much as they are now on shareholder value. So both the signs—from companies that are internally evaluating their own boardroom dynamics and from investment companies that are looking to come to the gates and to take a couple of these companies private—remind us that companies have a perspective about their own cash that is either use it or lose it.  And it would not surprise me to find some very large “blue chip” companies that feel either under attack or on the precipice of being attacked tending to be bolder in their capital expenditure budgets. What’s likely to happen in the capital markets should that all come to pass?  One thing that may happen, and may be a first casualty, in the investment-grade capital market is that some very large-cap “blue chip” companies with exceptional investment-grade ratings will all of a sudden find that they are in play by some LBO buyers and private equity participants.  As you all well know, generally in the investment-grade market there has not been much of a change-of-control premium in investment-grade credit, unlike in the high-yield market.  But should a couple of large transactions occur either here in the United States or in Europe, where a double-A credit one day ends up looking more like a high-yield credit the next, we might find that investment-grade investors are asking for a greater premium in those markets.  I think all of this is a possibility as we think about ’06 and ’07—not a promise but a real possibility that we should continue to keep a keen eye on and evaluate.  As that dynamic goes forward, we will have an early signal telling us whether the cap-ex numbers will come in larger than expected. Finally, with respect to inflation, I would add to some of the comments that the Vice Chairman made yesterday by noting that long-term inflation expectations as calculated in the TIPS markets, while contained, are higher than ideal.  And the market expectations of potentially higher commodity prices and other material inputs might also cause further pressure on inflation.  As we as a Committee approach our last step or our penultimate step in possibly moving rates, the markets will be more and more focused on our own vigilance with respect to those inflation expectations. With that, I have finished."
"175";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, I agree with many of you around the table and with the Greenbook.  I see that you have solid growth going forward.  I want first to talk about the corporate sector and then to talk a bit about the household sector. I have talked with several corporate CFOs in the past couple of weeks, and I also just received a copy of the Duke quarterly CFO survey.  I found the comments from the CFOs and the survey results to be similar, and so I thought I would just use the Duke survey to make my comments here.  The CFOs are expecting to be able to raise prices more over this coming year than they did last year.  On average, they are expecting an increase in prices of about 3.3 percent.  A year ago at this time, the quarterly survey showed a 2 percent increase.  So the increase is slight.  And they are also expecting to raise wages and salaries faster, 4.2 percent this coming year.  Their biggest concerns continue to be global competition and health care costs—that has not changed at all. What I find really amazing is how much these CFOs continue to be focused on cash levels. Right now, as you know, the liquid assets on the balance sheets of corporations are at the highest level in at least forty-five years.  Corporate profit margins relative to GDP are running at 11 percent, and that is again a record level.  If you look at the survey results, the CFOs are saying that they plan to increase cash even more in 2006.  How are they going to do that? One of the things this group is forecasting this year is for earnings to grow 13.1 percent. Last March the survey said 11.4.  So the projection for earnings growth is up about 2 points.  They are not expecting top line revenue growth of 13 percent—they are expecting to be able to widen their operating margins.  So the trends we have been seeing are what everybody is just building on. This inertia and this new focus on cost management seem to be central to what is going on in corporate America.  Partly, too, they are worried about top-line revenue growth, and I am hearing more of them talking about using mergers to widen their operating margins:  Grow market share through acquisition, get immediate revenue pops, pull out the extra costs, and get the bottom line growth at 13 percent that way.  They also are planning to spend more on capital expenditures this year, up 6.5 percent versus 4.7 percent, and also much more employment growth, 2 percent versus 0.6.  So they are optimistic; but again, the focus on widening operating margins from already historically wide levels and on building liquid assets shows that a real focus on the fundamentals in corporate America is continuing. If you look at the survey of small businesses, you can read the same kinds of trends in the responses.  The optimism of small business remains at a very high level.  So, in summary, I think corporate America is going to continue to push earnings growth and production but is clearly focused on cost containment.  And while they may be looking at raising prices a bit, I think overall prices will be contained. Now, a look at the household sector.  What I have been noticing in the past few months is that job growth, as many of you have mentioned, has clearly gotten a lot stronger and also that wages are growing much faster—in the last three months, they have gone up at an annual rate of 4.8 percent, which is pretty strong.  I think we have to go back about four or five years to get that kind of increase. So the real question, as many of you have said, is what is really happening to productivity. The last time we had this kind of wage growth was in the late ’90s, and we saw the pop in productivity.  So unit labor costs were there and helped modify inflation.  I heard from the CFOs that this is exactly what they are trying to do—to find ways to improve productivity just so they can handle the higher wage cost because they are finding that skills are short in some areas.  But the highly skilled people are probably also more productive, on average, than other folks who may be looking for jobs, and hiring the more-productive workers could also help in that way. I think that the good job growth and the faster wage increases will also help put a floor on housing sales.  You know I have been concerned about where we are in terms of the mortgage markets going forward in support of housing.  We know that the fixed obligation ratio that our staff constructs has been at record levels; last quarter it showed a tick down in the fourth quarter, but it still is relatively high.  Mortgage rates on the long end have not really moved very much in the last couple of years.  But to the extent that so many new mortgages were financed with adjustable-rate mortgages in the last year and the ARM rate spread now has really moved up as we have moved short rates up, there is less than a point difference now between one-year ARMs and the term rates. So affordability, I think, is going to continue to come under more pressure going forward. Housing inventories are increasing.  Again, I talked to a CFO at a large builder.  They clearly are managing inventory much better than they did years ago, but even so, backouts on sales and such things are increasing.  The number of housing starts that they have in train and starts going forward are going to be slowing down, and they are giving guidance to the Street that they’re not going to get the sales that they had.  But even if it slows down, housing is still going to be very strong in relation to historical standards, but it will be off the peak that we have been seeing. Finally, to follow up on the comments that some of you made, I see that we still have a tremendous amount of liquidity in the financial markets.  Again, corporations are sitting on all this liquidity.  We do not hear anything from corporations about difficulty in financing big or small business.  We know the bankers clearly are looking for loan growth and trying to find it, and the housing market is able to attract all the liquidity it needs.  So in terms of how effective our rate increases have been, I see that the lag effect is still there and that plenty of liquidity is still out there, which keeps me focused on where core inflation will be.,   I would say that, until about six months ago, most of it was risk aversion. Corporations were not sure what their plans were going to be.  They did not know how they were going to get earnings growth, and so I think some was a precautionary kind of savings.  They clearly deploy most of it into restructuring their balance sheets, refinancing, and getting corporate leverage down.  A number of them use some of the cash, playing the accounting game of putting it into pension funds and booking a higher yield on the pension than they could in short-term investments in equipment and software.  But I am beginning to hear that they are more likely to loosen the strings and have more cash going forward. Another interesting thing I heard from one CFO, although somebody just mentioned the danger of anecdotes, is that they are putting more of what they call “investments” in human resource training and development than in equipment because they see that, if they cannot hire the people with skills, they have to develop the skills of the good employees they have.  We do not capture that, but it may be one of the ways they are using the cash flow."
"176";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and welcome back.,   I notice that you are without a Hawaiian shirt. [Laughter],   Next meeting, okay.  [Laughter]  We’ve had a wide range of contacts in New England since our last meeting, so what I’m going to do is try to summarize five or six different things that came out as a result of this range of contacts. The first point is basically driven by the data.  New England continues to grow more slowly than the nation.  Actually, employment growth year over year is about a third of the pace of the nation as a whole—sort of normal, in a way.  New England tends to have a slower-growing population and labor force than the rest of the nation.  But the recent pace of job growth is decidedly slower than the long-run average.  Nonetheless, regional businesses seem to be broadly participating in the growth of the overall economy, and even the pace of losses in manufacturing jobs seems to be slowing.  Indeed, merchandise exports for the region were quite strong despite continuing manufacturing job losses, suggesting that regional manufacturers have figured out a way to enjoy some productivity growth and to keep their output relatively high. Almost all contacts have been quite upbeat about sales and revenue expectations for this year.  Most state corporate tax collections have been booming, and retail sales and state sales tax revenues are at or above budget almost everywhere except Rhode Island.  Rhode Island seems to be going through a kind of flattening of growth.  I’m not exactly sure why. At a recent conference of regionwide Realtors, optimism was expressed by heads of state Realtor groups that, so far, home sales and prices, although they are certainly moderating, have held up fairly well.  And that’s even considering the fact that in the fourth quarter of last year, sales in the Northeast, unlike for the nation, declined for both new and existing homes.  But ’06 was viewed by this group as proceeding fairly well. There is some evidence of tight labor markets for certain skilled jobs.  We have in one of our advisory groups a CEO of a software firm that does software and consulting services oriented toward recruitment for Global 2000 customers.  She reported that their clients around the world are having difficulty hiring health care, technology, finance, and professional-level sales personnel.  So she was seeing some real uptick in labor market tightness at the high end. And I must say that when you look at commercial vacancy rates, which have declined for Class A downtown and suburban space, not just in Boston but elsewhere, you seem to get the impression that maybe businesses haven’t started to hire yet but they do have plans to hire and they do have plans to hire at the high end. Finally, local measures of price growth remain quite contained, though headline CPI data indicate that the region has suffered more than the nation from high energy and utility costs, even with the quite mild winter. In assessing the reaction of contacts about cost increases, we heard a bit less complaining this time around.  Maybe people have just given up complaining, or perhaps they have found ways—and I think this is probably more true than not—to offset high commodity and energy costs through rising productivity. The picture for the nation is even better than it is for New England.  We, like the Greenbook authors, have been a bit surprised and pleased at the strength of the incoming data after the bump in the fourth quarter.  David mentioned all the good reasons to be pleased—strong employment, solid consumer spending, not much evidence yet of a large drag from housing, solid business investment and production, very favorable financing conditions, faster growth than the rest of the world, and through it all, moderating headline and rather flat core inflation, whether you look at the CPI or the PCE, reflecting a leveling-out of energy prices and continued strong productivity growth.  True, some luck has been involved, particularly the rather temperate winter weather in the Northeast, with its good news for overall energy and electricity costs.  And the drop in new home sales may be a harbinger of worse to come.  But the first quarter is over, and it was stronger than we expected, even allowing for a bounceback from Q4. Looking ahead, we agree with the general trajectory of the Greenbook forecast, as we have for some time.  However, we have penciled in a somewhat greater effect in ’06 on growth from the expected falloff in housing—that is, an actual small decline in residential investment in every quarter this year and a related effect on consumption from a flattening of the growth in household wealth.  So our GDP forecast for ’06 is somewhere between three- and four-tenths lower than the Greenbook’s, though ’07 is just about the same. We also see a smaller uptick in core inflation this year, largely because we see labor markets as having a bit more capacity than does the Greenbook, which we believe accounts for some of the moderation in wage and salary growth, at least by some measures.  It may be splitting hairs to mention what in the end are small differences between Boston’s forecast and the Greenbook’s. After all, we don’t have the same number of resources in Boston focusing on making a forecast as you do here for the Greenbook.  But I think we are at a point where small differences in outlook really do affect how each of us sees the policy choices. Now, what are the risks around this benign, if not rosy, outlook?  Will they continue to revolve around growth that is higher than expected, prompted by a continuation of consumer strength—if, for example, housing takes less of a bite out of growth than we expect—and by financial conditions that could remain more stimulative as well?  Indeed, when we look both at where we’ve been off in evaluating the outlook over the past couple of years and at our own Boston forecast, the surprises have mostly been the result of rising household wealth and a related set of very favorable financial market conditions.  If these conditions continue, greater inflationary pressure than we expect could well result, given where we are in terms of resource utilization.  And of course, new energy shocks are possible, given the possible geopolitical unrest and tight supply conditions.  Alternatively, looking at risks on the other side, a greater-than-expected slowdown in housing, with a related larger pickup in saving rates, could put an unexpected damper on growth. Absent new energy shocks, this would act to moderate both growth and inflationary pressures more than expected.  So we see housing as integral to both upside risks and downside risks. As I see it right now, the risks to the forecast appear relatively well balanced, maybe a touch to the side of inflation.  That’s mostly because we’ve had a lot of recent experiences with surprises on the upside relative to growth, with rising energy and commodity prices, and overall resource capacity is hard to be very precise about.  However, I really don’t see large upside inflation risks, mostly because of what we’ve seen in terms of ongoing productivity growth.  It remains solid, and it continues to act as a powerful buffer.  Indeed, despite the temporary drop-off in Q4, I have not seen or heard anything from my contacts that suggests the underlying business drive to be ever more productive will slow, or slow anytime soon.  So although my assessment of risks has a small upside tilt and I am concerned about how expensive being very wrong on the inflation side would be, I don’t see the situation as significantly unbalanced.,   I don’t think we’re misinterpreting it.  I think that’s what’s going on.,   Do you count state and local construction in that?  Does that come in nonresidential or in state and local spending?,   Because that, I would think, has the potential to be pretty strong, given the tax collections and so forth."
"177";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The momentum in the Fourth District economy appears to be broadly similar to the rest of the country’s.  The region appears to be expanding at a good but not spectacular pace.  Although my District never experienced the extreme acceleration in housing activity seen in many other parts of the country, we are nonetheless seeing some downturn in residential activity relative to last year.  And, of course, we are being affected by the shifting fortunes in the auto industry.  The further we move into the year, the more optimistic business people seem to be about the outlook.  The softness in last year’s fourth quarter is now all but forgotten.  Business leaders in the District are sticking with strong capital spending plans, and I’ve been getting especially positive reports on commercial construction. Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook baseline captures the broad contours of my own expectations—namely, a slowing in personal consumption spending and, as many others have commented, in the housing sector over the course of the year, leading the overall economy back toward a moderating but solid growth path next year. As for the outlook on prices, I am still predicting that headline inflation will shift down this year from last year’s energy-shocked pace and move much closer to the center of my preference range.  Overall, I really am not seeing a lot in the way of warning signs that inflationary pressures are building.  I get sporadic reports of labor market tightness, a point to which I’ll return in a minute. But I hear just as many reports highlighting the moderation of energy costs, especially for natural gas.  The headline and ex-food and energy CPI inflation for February were quite favorable and were certainly interpreted as such by financial markets.  And, importantly, inflation expectations do appear to be well contained.  Like others, in Cleveland we typically monitor the ten-year TIPS spreads, and those certainly have not been giving me any cause for alarm.  Despite this, I get a sense from business contacts that the full pass-through of energy and material costs into final goods prices may not yet be complete.  Consequently, the arc of my outlook is quite similar to that of the Greenbook—some slight tick-up in core inflation this year as a whole, with core measures moving down to more-desirable levels in 2007. As I turn to the risks to the outlook, I try to think of those places where my staff’s analysis or the comments that I hear from my business contacts seem most at odds with the Greenbook projections.  If there is one area of some disagreement, it would be the degree to which the Greenbook seems to emphasize potential increases in labor costs as a source of upward price pressures in the near term.  Consistent with the Greenbook assessment, I am hearing, for the first time in years, reports of some tightening in labor markets and some accelerating wage growth. However, to echo your theme, Mr. Chairman, the job vacancies and wage pressures do appear to be concentrated in a small number of high-skilled occupations.  My list is very similar to President Minehan’s.  In truth, I have to work pretty hard to get my business contacts to talk about their concerns about accelerating wage costs.  And I fear just a little that my interrogations may be forcing confessions from the innocent.  [Laughter]  At the same time, my business contacts are still optimistic about their ability to generate solid productivity gains.  Although I do expect to see some continued pass-through of previous shocks to core measures of inflation, these influences are expected to dissipate over the course of the year. When I add up all of these pieces, I don’t see much evidence that capacity constraints are likely to drive up price and wage pressures.  What I don’t know, of course, is whether the reports that I’m getting are peculiar to the Fourth District.  When I look at the employment cost data over the past several quarters, they seem consistent with a relatively benign wage cost picture.  But I heard from a few of my colleagues ahead of me that they are seeing a different picture.  I am interested in whether these anecdotal impressions that I’m getting are just a Fourth District peculiarity or whether they’re spread more broadly.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   I was just going to add to that, David.  For so many months I was hearing about some increased construction in health care facilities and school buildings.  But in the past few months it has been broader than that—it has been office buildings and some plants."
"178";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  May I say it’s a great pleasure to see you back at the table.  And while I hesitate to wish your predecessor’s eighteen years of service on anyone, I look forward to many interesting and productive meetings under your leadership. The latest monthly data show significant strength in activity for the quarter just ending, and I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that this strength represents a temporary catch-up after the weak fourth quarter.  I anticipate that growth will likely settle back to trend as the year progresses, especially as the lagged effect of tighter financial conditions damps interest-sensitive sectors.  The current risks to this scenario are by now a well-known litany—housing, energy prices, the saving rate, foreign demand, and term premiums.  Overall, I judge the risk to the growth forecast to be pretty well balanced. I did want to comment briefly on the risks associated with housing.  This is the sector that obviously bears close watching because it can represent the leading edge of the effects of the monetary tightening.  Thus far, published data on housing starts and permits provide rather little evidence of a significant weakening in construction activity, although other indicators such as home-buying attitudes and new home sales, along with a growing amount of anecdotal evidence, suggest that tighter financing conditions are finally exacting a toll.  I think one possible reason that starts and permits have remained so strong is that the inventory margin is taking up some of the slack in demand.  Indeed, the stock of unsold homes on the market has now reached quite high levels. I noted a similar phenomenon in talking to a real estate developer in what has been the sizzling Phoenix housing market.  In that market, demand has been so strong that builders couldn’t build houses fast enough to satisfy buyers.  So delivery times for new homes were very long.  And as the demand for new homes has slowed recently, we haven’t seen a noticeable change in building activity, but there has been a significant decline in delivery times.  As this margin, like unsold inventories, returns to more historical norms, I think that we’ll see the moderation in demand show up in new construction numbers as well. Turning to inflation, I think it’s worth stressing how good recent readings have been.  Over the past twelve months, core PCE prices are up 1.8 percent, the market-based component 1.5 percent, and the core CPI just 2.1 percent.  As I’ve noted in previous meetings over the past six months, we have been more optimistic than the Greenbook about the prospects for core inflation during 2006.  For quite some time now, we have been on the order of several tenths of a percentage point lower.  And I continue to think that core PCE price inflation will come in at about 1.8 percent this year. As the Greenbook forecast drifts down, I think maybe my stubbornness is paying off.  My relative optimism partly reflects my view, based on econometric evidence using data after the early 1980s, that there is little pressure for higher inflation coming from the pass-through of energy prices to labor compensation or core prices.  Another important element in my optimistic inflation outlook is inflation expectations, which I consider to be well contained and unlikely to provide significant upward impetus to inflation.  At the same time, I think it’s important not to ignore the potential adverse inflationary consequences from a resurgent economy. I realize the link between resource utilization and inflation is a contentious topic.  Actually, the Philadelphia Fed’s Survey of Professional Forecasters asked its respondents whether they used the concept of a natural rate of unemployment in their macroeconomic projections, and the replies indicate a split of about 50–50.  About half the economic forecasters, in other words, use such a rate, and the other half don’t.  And my guess is that there is also a considerable difference of opinion around this table.  Personally, I’m persuaded that excess demand in a market does tend to push up prices and that the domestic labor market is no exception to this rule.  I think that the econometric evidence supports that view. President Fisher has been arguing, and perhaps some others would agree, that what matters is not just U.S. productive capacity but worldwide capacity.  I do agree that the world—or, more accurately, the aggregate supply curve—has probably become flatter.  But while globalization has had a profound impact on the U.S. economy in a number of ways, I think that there are a number of reasons to doubt that it will overturn, at least completely, the normal historical relationship between domestic labor market slack and inflation.  The first point here is simply that many goods and most services still must be produced in the United States, and so foreign capacity isn’t an issue.  The second point is that, in order to utilize productive capacity in foreign countries, we do need to run a trade deficit; in principle, such deficits eventually put downward pressure on our exchange rates, which tends to raise the prices paid for imports in the United States.  I’m sure this is a topic we will be discussing in a lot more detail going forward. Of course, the measurement of aggregate excess demand or slack is difficult, and I’m sympathetic to the view that there is no bright red line for the unemployment rate that, once crossed, triggers higher inflation.  But by examining a variety of indicators, I think it’s possible to get a useful notion of aggregate resource utilization.  I would judge that these measures currently fall in a range from a modest amount of slack to a modest amount of excess demand.  Specifically, the unemployment rate, the vacancy rate, the employment–population ratio, capacity utilization, and other measures are all within a few tenths, in unemployment rate terms, of full employment. Looking ahead, with the unemployment rate already at 4.8 percent, I think it’s logical to worry that wage and price inflation will rise over time if resource slack diminishes further.  And with GDP growth forecast at 3¾ percent this year, a naïve calculation based on Okun’s law suggests that the unemployment rate could fall to 4½ percent by the fourth quarter.  In contrast, the Greenbook assumes that the unemployment rate will remain unchanged.  The Greenbook inflation projection is, accordingly, more optimistic than a forecast based on the naïve model. Now, given the importance of the behavior of unemployment to one’s forecast of inflation, my staff has been looking at the performance and fit of Okun’s law—namely, the relationship between output growth and the change in the unemployment rate.  And I think their analysis provides support for the Greenbook assessment.  Using a dynamic version of Okun’s law that fits exceptionally well after 1961, my staff finds evidence of an error correction between the output and the unemployment gaps.  During 2005, unemployment declined substantially more than a simple version of Okun’s law would have predicted.  And this dynamic model suggests that, even with fast economic growth, the unemployment rate will likely be pushed up a bit this year, as this unusual decline in 2005 is reversed. So to sum up, I see steady growth and few pressures for price acceleration.,   Okay.  I guess my view is that it’s a risk, but at the moment, by various measures, we’re pretty close to, not beyond, full employment.  The unemployment rate has declined unusually rapidly over the last year, but a simple Okun’s law calculation—and I think that the staff has commented on this in the past, if I’m not mistaken—would assess the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate during 2005 as especially large, given what output growth was.  In that sense, the unemployment rate is now giving us a reading of less slack in the economy than we would get from other indicators.  Our forecast is that the mysterious decline in the unemployment rate last year will be reversed so unemployment will hold steady, even with growth at the magnitude that the Greenbook is projecting (around 3¾ percent).  That’s what the error-correction mechanism is about. So I’m optimistic about inflation because I see us ending 2006 at roughly full employment, with the unemployment rate in the vicinity of its current level.  I’m also optimistic about inflation because we’ve been persuaded that since the 1980s we’ve seen very little pass-through of energy- price increases into core inflation.  That has been a source of considerably more optimism on our part than on Greenbook’s part in that it continues to project pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core inflation through 2006.,   Well, I think the econometric evidence suggests that the pass-through has declined and doesn’t speak clearly to the reason for the decline.  My guess would be that inflation expectations have become better anchored, and market participants have more confidence in the Fed’s commitment to price stability.  And so there are fewer, in effect, inflation scares of the type we had in the ’70s, when inflation expectations became unhinged.  In that sense, of course, it is contingent on policy.  I think policy has also been more consistently responsive to movements in inflation—not only in the sense of having become more creative but also in the sense of systematically raising the real federal funds rate in response to an increase in inflation, which wasn’t always the case previously.,   It certainly could.,   That could be one of the drivers.  Sure, I agree with that."
"179";"PRESIDENT FISHER.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Same thing.  [Laughter]"
"180";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060328meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like all of you, we think the underlying trajectory of demand and inflation seems quite favorable, perhaps a bit more so than it did in January.  We expect real GDP to grow at a rate slightly above the rate of increasing potential in ’06 and to slow to the range of potential in ’07.  We expect the core PCE to rise at a rate in the neighborhood of 2 percent over the forecast period.  Differences between our forecast and the Greenbook’s are minor.  In our forecast, we assume that inflation expectations remain anchored and the term premium remains low and that we are now at a point where little or no resource slack is left in the domestic economy. The monetary policy assumption we adopt is the path currently priced into the futures markets.  The major sources of uncertainty in our forecast are the size of the wealth effect we might see accompanying any slowdown of housing, the flexibility of profit margins, and the sustainability of this present configuration of low risk premiums.  We view the risk to the growth forecast as roughly balanced, although the usual suspects provide a source of concern.  The risk to our inflation forecast, in contrast, still seems slightly tilted to the upside. On the growth front, as I said, we think the underlying pace of demand growth is pretty strong, and we don’t see any signs yet that would point to evidence of a significant slowdown relative to potential in prospect.  We think productivity growth is likely to remain quite high, rising perhaps a bit faster this year than in ’05.  With the labor market growing on trend and some increase in labor’s share of national income, we expect consumption growth to remain reasonably strong. Stronger income growth offsets the expected deceleration in housing-price appreciation and the effect that might have on consumption.  We expect a slight increase in the contribution of business fixed investment to demand growth, due principally to a rise in spending on equipment and software.  We expect, of course, the contribution of residential investment to slow with the forecast period.  World GDP growth seems stronger and more broadly based.  We expect net exports to be a persistent drag, shaving about ½ percentage point off growth for each of the next two years. Despite this forecast of pretty strong spending growth and high levels of resource utilization, we believe core inflation is likely to remain moderate.  Under the assumption of a relatively stable dollar and with the energy-price assumption taken from the futures curve, we expect headline inflation to slow to a rate closer to the core over the forecast period.  But this forecast rests on three important foundations.  The first is that we succeed in keeping inflation expectations reasonably well anchored.  The second is that demand growth not only does not accelerate to a rate substantially above trend but also slows to potential over the forecast period.  And the third is that the expected rise in compensation and unit labor costs results in a rise in labor share of income—in other words, that compensation growth accelerates but the increase is absorbed by some compression of profit margins and does not lead to a significant acceleration in core inflation. Now, the sources of potential upside risk to the inflation forecast are several.  One, of course, comes from the interaction between our views about productivity growth, compensation, and profit margins.  If the pace of productivity growth slows significantly relative to our assumption and if, at the same time, conditions in labor markets continue to improve, unit labor costs are then likely to accelerate.  A rise in compensation, however, would not by itself portend a troubling increase in core inflation.  The extent of this risk, as I said, depends on the degree to which rising unit labor costs are absorbed in shrinking profit margins rather than triggering output price increases as firms attempt to defend existing margins.  And because the labor share of income seems somewhat low and, as historical averages suggest, there’s room for unit labor cost growth to be absorbed in profit margins rather than causing price increases, we need to be attentive to the risk that this process may produce a short-term increase in core inflation, perhaps also in inflation expectations. A second potential risk comes from what we think we know about the pace of demand relative to potential supply globally.  A continued increase in commodity prices around the globe and, more recently, some modest increase in capital goods prices may suggest that global pressures on resource constraints are pushing up prices.  This raises the risk that the recent weakness in core goods prices in the United States may not be sustained.  Service price inflation in the United States has shown signs of slowing. Our central forecast, as I said, is conditioned on little movement in the dollar over the forecast period, but any sizable depreciation of the dollar would still carry the risk of some acceleration in core goods prices. For nearly two years, overall inflation, as what is measured by the PCE or the CPI would suggest, has been running substantially above core, and this is true for a range of alternative measures of underlying inflation.  If the underlying inflation rate were closer to 1.5 percent than to 2 percent, we might view these potential sources of upward pressure with more equanimity. Although the probability seems low that these forces will act to produce a significant acceleration of core inflation or a significant deterioration in inflation expectations, we need to be careful about those risks.  So with underlying inflation at the upper end of the inferred inflation preference of the Committee, we need to be more attentive to these risks. On the growth side, the most obvious sources of downside risk to growth are a substantial rise in energy prices from current levels, a slowdown in productivity growth, a sharp rise in risk premiums, and a more-adverse effect on saving and consumption from the expected adjustment in housing markets and prices.  Like the staff forecast, we think it’s reasonable to expect household saving to rise a bit and consumption growth to slow, in part because of changing expectations about the pace of future appreciation in the value of home equity.  But we believe that, absent some large, negative shock to perceptions about employment and earned income, the effects of the expected cooling in housing prices are going to be modest.  Of course, this view may prove optimistic.  We take some reassurance from the fact that the average growth forecast in the private sector probably anticipates a significant cooling in housing and a significant effect of that cooling on saving and consumption. Developments in asset prices and risk premiums over the past several months seem to support this picture of stronger confidence in the growth and inflation outlook because real rates seem to have risen.  Equity prices and credit spreads suggest considerable confidence in the prospect for growth.  Implied volatilities remain quite low.  We don’t know how much of this is fundamental and how much will prove ephemeral.  At the moment, though, overall financial conditions seem pretty supportive of the expansion. So with this forecast of growth in the vicinity of potential, core inflation at around 2 percent, and the risk somewhat to the upside for inflation, we think the principal responsibility of monetary policy remains to preserve the sense that we will act to keep long-term inflation expectations contained at levels consistent with price stability.,   As in many cases, I am not sure what you can take from the anecdote, but I guess some people say that you see a little of the froth dissipating.  But I don’t think the adjustment is acute.  If you see hiring at the New York Fed go up substantially in the market, that will be a good leading indicator of housing prices reverting somewhat.  [Laughter]"
"181";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  I think we are ready now to move on to our economic go- round.  Let me remind you of our convention.  Raise one hand to be put into the queue to speak, and raise two hands if you would like to make an immediate intervention or ask a question pertaining to one of your colleague’s comments.  President Yellen.,   Do you or your staff have a view on the breakdown between the term premium and future expected rates in terms of the far forward increase in interest rates?,   Thank you.  President Lacker.,   President Lacker, one issue I have with these surveys is that, when they ask about price changes, they don’t distinguish between intermediate goods and final goods.  Of course, the final goods are what we care about.  Have you tried to make that distinction in your surveys?,   President Moskow.,   President Fisher.,   President Fisher, you don’t see any drag from high interest rates or energy prices on this overall strength?,   I’m still trying to understand that comment about the schizophrenia.  [Laughter]  President Poole.,   President Poole, did your contacts have anything to say about the issue of whether the strength in retail sales was a seasonal factor or something else?,   Thank you.  President Minehan.,   Thank you.  President Pianalto.,   Thank you.  First Vice President Stone.,   Thank you.  President Hoenig.,   Thank you.  President Guynn.,   Thank you.  President Stern.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   I will comment as well on TIPS spreads, but those markets are fairly concentrated, and therefore, liquidity issues sometimes play a role in these high-frequency movements.,   Governor Olson.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Governor Bies.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   It worries me that we are in the hands of some exuberant 30-year- olds.  [Laughter],   Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you, and thank you all for your very concise comments. [Laughter]  We will take a fifteen-minute coffee break. [Coffee break],   At this point I would normally try to summarize the remarks around the table.  But since you have all just heard them and since my own views are not terribly different from many who have spoken, I think in the interest of time I will just go ahead and talk briefly on my own behalf about what I see the economy doing, and then we will turn to the policy go-round. First of all, with respect to growth, I think we are following the path laid out by the Greenbook toward greater moderation in the second half.  The main difference is that, since our last meeting, the uncertainty around that prospective path has increased.  Obviously, the key to this moderation is the housing market, and fundamental analysis would suggest that the combination of high prices and rising interest rates would make affordability a problem and would bring housing starts and housing prices down. So far we are seeing, at worst, an orderly decline in the housing market; but there is still, I think, a lot to be seen as to whether the housing market will decline slowly or more quickly.  As I noted last time, some correction in this market is a healthy thing, and our goal should not be to try to prevent that correction but rather to ensure that the correction does not overly influence growth in the rest of the economy. I would also note that there are going to be some offsets to the decline in residential investment. We’ve noted increases in nonresidential construction, which is about half the size, as a share of GDP, of residential construction and, in terms of contribution to GDP, could make up something like a half of the direct impact of a decline in residential spending.  We also have gotten a sense that capital spending is relatively strong, and world growth is also strong, which may enhance our exports.  So there are some countervailing factors to help cushion the presumed decline in the housing market. But as we talk about the housing market, which is 6 percent of GDP, or nonresidential construction, which is 2.7 percent of GDP, we have to pay very close attention to consumption, which is 70 percent of GDP and which really is the center of the forecast for the rest of the year.  The soft landing scenario viewed in the Greenbook requires that consumption grow the rest of the year at something around 3.4 percent, which is roughly what it has been doing in the last year or so on average.  I think that is broadly plausible. There are factors on both sides of it.  Supporting consumption, obviously, are some increases in compensation likely coming forward both in terms of hourly wages and in terms of hours worked, job availability, and to some extent maybe increases in stock prices.  On the negative side, many people have pointed out the effect of rising interest rates and softening in housing prices.  Energy is actually a bit of a mixed bag.  Energy prices are obviously a negative for consumption in level terms, but we have had a big drag on consumption for the past two years from increasing energy prices, and so if energy prices do stabilize, the drag will actually be less in 2006 than in previous years.  So, again, I do think that the slowdown that has been forecast by the Greenbook is plausible, but like a number of people around the table, I would note that so far it is largely a prospective slowdown and that the data have only begun to support that development. On the inflation side, I have somewhat more concern, like a number of people.  Core inflation has been remarkably stable, and I do not think it is going to rise very much; but to the extent that there are risks, they are very largely to the upside.  And I also have some concerns about the possible emergence of some inflation psychology, which is a very negative thing for our policymaking.  The factors that support higher inflation are well known.  First, energy and commodity prices.  I would point out that, rather than being transitory, they have now undergone a long, sustained increase, which evidently must at some point get into the cost structure of firms.  Second, the weakening dollar over the past month or so may be sufficient to add some pressure.  Third, the effect of compensation, I understand, is a little ambiguous.  There are some factors working in the other direction, including markups and productivity, but clearly the sense around the table is that compensation is beginning to move up somewhat, and the risks there I think are also to the upside.  Finally, it is worth noting that, at a technical level, some of the components of the inflation indexes are moving upward—in particular, owners’ equivalent rent.  It economically makes sense that, if house prices have risen so much, rents will begin to rise.  Since that is a very large share of both the CPI and the PCE core measures, that is going to be an upside risk for us. Now, again, I do not want to overstate the problem.  I think that core inflation will remain contained, to use our language, but I am concerned about those risks.  Clearly, the markets have seen a strengthening of the economy and increased inflation risk.  Despite all of our communication and language, it is summarized by an increase of about 25 basis points in where they think the federal funds rate is going to end up later this year.  We have seen and already discussed the increase in inflation compensation and in other measures of inflation expectations.  Much of our confidence that the pass-through from energy, from the dollar, and from labor costs to final goods inflation will be low is predicated on the view that inflation expectations are low and well contained.  When that premise begins to break down, then all the other elements of the analysis also begin to come under pressure. Finally, as a number of people have noted, although we do not have an official definition of price stability, we are at the upper level of what might plausibly be called the region of price stability, and further increases will be difficult and potentially costly to reverse.  So looking forward to the policy discussion, I think we are going to have to take into account the emerging inflation risk.  At the same time, there is an awful lot of uncertainty about what is going on in the economy.  It is going to be a difficult balancing act to try to maintain as much flexibility as possible so that policy can respond to new data as they arrive.  At this point I would like to turn over the floor to Vincent, who will talk about the policy options."
"182";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, at the last meeting, I reported the comments of a CEO of a big box retailer who said the economy was “amazing.”  I suppose the best summary of what I’m about to report to you in terms of my readings in the field—this time I assiduously talked to twenty-five CEOs and COOs, and I’ll give you that list separately so I won’t bore you with the details—the economy is even more amazing than it was before.  That is, we see a shift taking place from consumption-driven to business-investment-driven growth, but also, unfortunately, we see evidence that inflation is raising its ugly head and that inflation expectations are higher as we go through time. Let me give you some specifics.  According to reports from shippers that I’ve talked to, the shipping market for bulk and containers is stronger in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. Karen, there is a report, which is why I would like to see a more definitive version, of fleet utilization running well over 90 percent and waiting time in ports increasing significantly.  My rail contacts report that rail traffic as of April 22 is up 4½ percent for the year.  They expect higher growth in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  UPS is planning for “some moderation in volume” but “hasn’t seen any sign yet of a slowdown, discounting for the late Easter.”  An airline with 80 million passengers reports very strong advance bookings through July in every region of the country. Some pressure from gas going over $3 at the pump has been reported, particularly in the past two weeks, by the retailers at every price point; and yet there’s an interesting shift taking place.  For example, JCPenney now runs a billion dollars worth of sales through the Internet.  That growth rate is increasing; it’s 23 percent.  This way of presenting their products to the market helps to offset the oil price effect. In the IT sector, the book-to-bill ratio of the large semiconductors is still greater than 1. Companies like EDS and other “productivity enhancers” are seeing increased demand for their products, which they interpret as a vote of confidence.  We’re also seeing increased demand for storage capacity, which many would interpret as a vote of confidence going forward in the business picture. From the largest bank in our District, the report is that volume is “so good you’re able to eat it.” They report, by the way—I don’t want to give offense to any sector of our economy—that the only people having credit problems are personal injury lawyers in Texas because of the reform that has taken place there.  But other than that, the credits, as reported by banks, look to be in very, very good shape. In terms of the housing market, you may recall my last report from a large house builder who built 400,000 homes thus far.  I’ve expanded that to another builder of similar size.  The cancellation rate now, David, is up to 40 percent—a key indicator.  However, it has shifted around the country, and in our state they report that you’d have to be a princess on a pea to feel any discomfort with the Texas housing market.  It is booming, unlike the Florida market—which, as you know, is cascading. As far as cost-cutting capital expansion, it continues.  Fluor reports a remarkable first-time-in- history statistic, which is that every single sector that they deal with, and every one of their product lines, is on the uptick.  I want to report one particular project in summary that just puts things in perspective.  Texas Utilities is about to announce a $10 billion coal-processing plant.  This is conversion from coal to electricity.  It will generate 40,000 jobs in our state to construct and 21,000 permanent jobs. But here’s the interesting statistic.  It’ll take 12 million manhours and womanhours to construct.  The CEO reports that ten years ago all those jobs would have been American jobs.  Only 4 million of the manhours and womanhours to construct this project will be American jobs; the rest of the construction will be done in China or in Germany.  Five years ago, it would have taken six years to build.  According to the CEO, they’ll build it in three years, and to go to President Moskow’s point, yesterday the CEO of a large—as we used to say—“underwriting house” in New York offered to assume all the financing. They will finance at 100 percent nonrecourse.  There’s a lot of liquidity in the system. We are concerned about prices.  We see pricing power creeping upward in the reports we’re getting from the CEOs.  As you know, our compass in Dallas is the trimmed mean PCE.  It’s running at a rate of about 2.3 percent.  At some point in the future, Mr. Chairman, I would like to provide a memo on that particular measure of inflation, which we consider to be a more reliable indicator of future inflation.  But the point is that, in all of our soundings among these operators of businesses, they are feeling increasing price pressure, both at the intermediate level and at the consumer level. There are two little indicators that I found interesting.  One is that Texas Instruments, which usually has 200 or 300 jobs maximum outstanding and looks for highly trained engineers, is now trying to fill 1,000 of those jobs and having trouble filling them.  Second, at the other end of the range, 7- Eleven reports that in Florida, the Great Lakes District, and the Chesapeake Bay area, they cannot find $7- to $8-an-hour sales clerks.  They are having to raise their prices. In short, we view this economy to be something like a 2006 BMW Z4 Roadster—Bluetooth- enabled, by the way.  It’s complex, it’s highly integrated, it’s a technically advanced machine that apparently cannot help itself from exceeding the speed limit.  [Laughter]  Thank you.,   The two house builders together built 700,000 homes; as you know, that industry is consolidating.  I asked them point blank whether the rates are killing them.  Now, you have to take this with some skepticism, but they said no.  The real issue here is that this highly speculative medium is becoming incredibly liquid.  There is obviously a self-feeding mechanism, and the statistic that probably illustrates it best is Palm Beach, Florida.  Last year, 6,000 homes were listed for sale.  This year, as of last week, 17,000 homes are listed for sale.  So what you have is a secondary market that is being speculated with, and advance liquidity provided by the financing mechanisms, and a lot of turmoil in that portfolio.  This type of entrepreneur almost always sees things as better than they actually are, and I do pay very close attention to the kind of data that we’re seeing.  But interest rates don’t seem to be the key issue, though obviously they kick in because of the way mortgages are priced. As far as the consumer is concerned—and Bill and I both talk to Wal-Mart in depth—they are obviously more worried about gas prices than they are about interest rates.  So I have a bit of schizophrenia like David.  David, schizophrenia beats dining alone.  [Laughter]  We can always talk to ourselves, when we can’t talk to anybody else.  The net feeling is that growth is stronger than we’re forecasting, and inflation—I agree with President Lacker and the others—is making me feel uncomfortable."
"183";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, regional data and anecdotal information from our various contacts suggest that the Southeast region economy continues to have good momentum.  Let me comment on just a few specific areas where what we’re seeing in our District may help to inform our view of the larger national economy. Regional employment gains continue to be strong, and we’re hearing more and more stories of tighter labor markets for a number of skills, mostly in construction and skilled professional positions, and compensation is going up significantly in a number of those areas.  At the same time, we also hear over and over about the lengths to which businesses are going to offset those wage increases with productivity gains, most making greater use of technology and process re-engineering. Like others, we’re continuing to see evidence of cooling in house sales and prices and a growing inventory of unsold homes in some of our markets.  The CEO of one of the nation’s largest home builders, who is headquartered in Atlanta and with whom I talk regularly, explained that a number of factors, in his view, have come together to precipitate that slowing—overbuilding, higher mortgage rates, a retreat of housing speculators, earlier conversion of many rental apartments to for-sale units, and now the wait-and-see attitude among those who still expect to purchase at some point.  He reinforced my sense that, while the cooling-off in housing is being felt to some extent in most markets, so far it is only the frothy coastal markets, like South Florida, that have seen a significant adjustment. The high cost of energy and industrial commodities is very much on people’s minds in our area, but the pass-through of those costs still seems to be limited.  Clearly, transportation costs are up significantly because of cost pass-through.  Some construction projects, including a few that were substantially sold out in the preconstruction phase, are being canceled and deposits are being returned because the construction material costs would make projects unprofitable.  An example of those cost pressures in construction:  A large builder told me last week that what he paid for copper wiring most recently was four times what he paid just a year ago. As an example of energy price pass-through, one member of our Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor Advisory Council related a story last week that is just too good not to share.  He said he was at a neighborhood gas station, in the middle of filling the tank of his big SUV, when the pumps suddenly stopped across the entire gas station.  An attendant came on the speaker system and announced that they were instituting an increase of ten cents a gallon. [Laughter]  And the ringer is that the increase would apply not only to the remainder of the gas he was about to pump but what he had already pumped.  [Laughter]  Good story.  What I would call real-time pass-through.  [Laughter] While overall performance seems solid, the outlook is not nearly so bright in the hurricane- affected areas, with which we’re still struggling.  The situation is especially difficult in New Orleans, where the damage was due largely to flooding and standing water, compared with the Mississippi coast, where damage was due to storm surge and wind.  Debris cleanup and infrastructure repairs still dominate the reconstruction efforts.  Even the demolition of damaged structures in New Orleans has barely begun, and there are few signs of any rebuilding in many of the more heavily flooded areas of the city.  New Orleans lost not only more than 200,000 jobs but also about the same number of homes, which were either destroyed or suffered major damage.  Little progress has been made in replacing either the jobs or the homes, and less than one-half of the pre-Katrina population is now back living in the city. There are a number of reasons for the lack of progress, including complex levee repairs; the need to redraw flood plains and set permit policies; political in-fighting; a shortage of workers and supplies; and insurance complications—just to mention a few.  For instance, the Corps of Engineers, which has some 150 people working out of our New Orleans Fed office, managing their projects, expects to repair the levee system by June 1, which is the official start of the new hurricane season.  But those repairs will bring the levees only to their pre-Katrina status, and longer-term solutions and spending will take years to implement.  Even after eight months, oil and gas supplies still remain disrupted.  Just under 23 percent of crude oil and 13 percent of natural gas production in the Gulf remain shut in, and the critical Mars platform, which accounts for about 40 percent of that shut-in, is still not up and running. Critical to the slow recovery process is the lack of housing for either returning or temporary workers.  Without housing, the economies in the affected areas will be slow to recover.  There are practical realities that also need to be faced.  People can’t continue to live in FEMA trailers forever, and those who are doing so are beginning to show signs of stress.  We have twelve of our own employees in trailers in our parking lot.  We’ve come to the view, which I’ve talked about before, that the experience from our past hurricanes may provide little guidance about either the pace or the path of recovery. We’re monitoring developments very carefully and also initiating some research projects to better understand the recovery process. Turning to the national economy, I’m encouraged that our collective forecast for a rebound in the first quarter was in fact on target, but I am less certain about the path going forward.  I, like others, see both upside and downside risks to real output and employment.  Major downside risks continue to be rooted in the possible effects of energy cost increases on consumer spending and business costs; potential consequences of a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in housing; and the impact of both short- term and longer-term interest rates, which have risen. Other key factors that could result in better-than-expected outcomes lie in the potential increase in investment spending; a surge in nonresidential and commercial construction; continued strength in consumer spending, particularly in durables and autos; and a pickup in inventory accumulation.  While my own staff’s forecasts for this meeting show a slowdown in the second half of the year, I’m not terribly confident about the specific sources from which that slowing will eventually come. Of greater concern to me, however, is the inflation outlook.  The core measures continue to be in the upper range of what most of us have indicated is acceptable.  The trends in these and headline inflation measures are data that the public observe and that affect inflation expectations, and it behooves us not to ignore them in favor of more-benign forecasts.  I am, therefore, concerned that we not do anything today to suggest that we have lost focus on either inflation or the way in which we intend to achieve our inflation objective.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"184";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start with our District.  Evidence from the District continues to show strong growth.  While consumer spending has shown some modest slowing, retailers remain very optimistic in our surveys about future sales, and this despite some of the recent increases in energy prices.  Manufacturing activity continues to grow solidly, and energy activity remains, of course, very strong in our area, with continued reports of shortages of both labor and equipment. Housing markets in the District are cooling, as you’ve heard described elsewhere, and illustrate I think a potential downside risk overall.  Though it’s still high by historical standards, residential construction continues to edge downward.  Home sales were still growing modestly in most areas but not fast enough to absorb the supply of homes being brought on the market.  As a result, first-quarter inventories in the largest District markets have grown markedly relative to a year ago.  In addition, foreclosures also point to some weakening in the housing market.  I guess the most notable is a 31 percent increase in March over the previous month that pushed Colorado to the highest foreclosure rate in the nation—as reported anyway.  One factor behind the increase is the unusually widespread use of interest-only mortgages in that state.  However, nonresidential construction in Colorado and elsewhere in the District appears to be taking up some of the slack from the housing side. Let me turn to the nation and try to be brief.  The contours of the outlook that we have are similar to what I reported at our last meeting and not unlike that from the Greenbook.  Several factors suggest that the economy will slow over the forecast period.  First, as I’ve suggested before, the removal of policy accommodation continues to have its effect.  Second, long-term interest rates have, as others reported, risen noticeably.  Third, energy prices continue to increase, reducing consumer purchasing power.  Finally, we’ve been forecasting a slowdown in housing, but there is a risk that the slowdown could be actually larger than expected. Of course, there are counterbalancing factors that would show continued growth.  Those have been outlined by others, but certainly the past stimulus in the amount of liquidity in the market has its effects.  In addition, we are seeing improvements in employment and in income, which should help keep the economy moving forward. On the inflation outlook, as others have noted, the recent increase in inflation is a concern to me, but it is not a surprise.  We have been expecting last year’s increase in energy prices to feed into a temporary rise in core inflation.  We’ve seen that.  More recent increases in energy are going to complicate that situation. So in the end, as we prepare for the next portion of this discussion this morning, I would agree with all my colleagues on one thing—monetary policy is going to be much more difficult in the next few months.  [Laughter]"
"185";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with many of the rest of you that inflation risks rose over the intermeeting period, though I think I see a more limited rise than I sensed from some of the comments I have heard.  Several factors do suggest higher inflation risk.  Stronger growth than expected has left resource utilization a little higher than we thought—only a touch, I think, but still higher.  The core CPI and PCE data were disappointing—were higher than anticipated.  That, however, did follow several months in which those data came in lower than we had expected.  And if you look at the Greenbook’s 2006 projection, it reverses a downward revision from last time.  That is not to say it is not worrisome, but we were revising down for a while, and now we have had an upward revision. I think the commodity price increases are hard to understand, especially outside the energy area, where you can think about supply disruptions.  Both the energy prices and the commodity prices could feed through to a limited extent into headline inflation.  I think they do indicate, at the very least, that global demand has continued to be quite strong.  In that regard, they would add to global inflation risks. The decline in the dollar is a bit worrisome.  The pass-through to import prices has been very, very small over recent decades.  But to the extent that the lower dollar is not passed through to import prices, it would be squeezing the profits of those people who are exporting to the United States, and I think, through either channel, this suggests at least a slight reduction in the competitive pressures on domestic producers— not big, but a slight reduction. We did have a small uptick in inflation expectations looked at through the markets or the Michigan survey.  However, those expectations are still in the range of recent years, and I can recall a number of occasions post-Katrina and in the last few springs in which they have ticked up in similar situations and then come back down again, particularly after energy prices leveled out. None of these signs of higher inflation are very significant in and of themselves or if they were taken one by one; but taken together, they cannot be dismissed.  They do suggest at least a small rise in inflation expectations and a small rise in inflation risk that could start pushing up underlying inflation further. That said, the data we have received over the intermeeting period should give us a little more confidence that conditions are being put in place or are in train to limit these risks and to keep the upside risk limited.  The trajectory of information over the intermeeting period, especially on consumption and housing, points to quite a bit of moderation of growth in the second quarter.  We are looking at 3-point- something, and the issue is what the point-something is; it is not 4-point-something or 5-point-something. Housing market information, I think, confirms that there is a slowdown in process that will restrain aggregate demand going forward.  Sales have bounced around a lot, but inventories have risen substantially by any measure.  That is going to be weighing on prices.  The price data are ambiguous and hard to read.  If you take a heroic leap and start seasonally adjusting the existing house prices on a month-by-month basis instead of a twelve-month basis, it looks as though they have been flattening out.  But we will get better data later.  If, indeed, prices are flattening out, we have not yet really seen that effect on consumption.  So in that sense, the tightening of policy and the flattening-out of housing prices are still in the pipeline. Higher long-term interest rates:  Some of that increase is an endogenous response to global growth and would require a higher path of short-term rates to keep inflation under control, but some of it is in the risk premium.  The extent to which the risk premium has risen will damp demand for any given course of monetary policy.  The energy-price increase will contribute to moderating growth of domestic demand, provided that we do not allow that energy-price increase to reduce real interest rates. Like some others here, I am kind of encouraged by the data on labor compensation.  They are mixed, but I have interpreted them on balance to suggest that pressures on businesses from labor cost developments are muted.  The ECI is certainly consistent with that, and so are four-quarter changes in compensation per hour and unit labor costs.  The markup of price over unit labor cost actually increased from a very high level to an even higher level.  I agree with President Poole that businesses will not voluntarily give up that markup, but we do have a recent experience if you look in the late ’90s.  That markup peaked at the end of ’97, I believe, and dropped very, very sharply in ’98 and ’99, despite the fact that the economy was growing with some vigor.  You can see that on page 39 of the Greenbook.  So perhaps we need to think about that episode and how it happened.  Certainly we have a precedent for vigorous growth and declining markup absorbing rising compensation costs. So where does that leave me overall?  I agree with the staff.  The most likely outcome—given the structure of interest rates, financial conditions, markets, and a flattening of energy prices—is for stable underlying inflation, core PCE to stay in the neighborhood of 2 percent, where it has been since early 2004. But I am a little more nervous about the stability than I was at the last meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"186";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  You will hear me singing a familiar song from last time, although not exactly the same song, and unfortunately I did forget my tap shoes.  The song that I want to sing from last time is the continued strength and resilience of the economy plus concerns about inflation expectations moving out of line. Consumption growth has been moderating a bit, but exactly as Governor Olson said, with the continuation of some of the changes in the tax laws, real disposable income will still have a boost.  We have seen very strong global demand, particularly on the consumption side in many countries that have been lagging in consumption.  In addition, we are also seeing strong investment demand, both domestically and internationally, and I think that is something that we have to take into account going forward. As for the key risks going forward, one, of course, is the housing market.  There has been a lot of discussion of that, and I do not think I have very much more to add.  We have to see what the lagged effects of interest rate changes are there, but that is something to be determined. Some puzzles that have persisted since last time concern the lack of pass-through of a number of things.  Of the heightened energy and commodity prices to core inflation, we have seen some uptick.  But I share Governor Kohn’s analysis, or his conclusions from the analysis, that there are some signs but that one should not be overly wary because we have had a bit of downtick, then a bit of uptick.  When we are talking about monthly movements of 0.1 percent, a simple rounding error can make things seem suddenly much higher or much lower.  It could be a 50 percent difference from what we expect when we really are just seeing a rounding error, although we do have to be very aware of this. Obviously, we have not seen pass-through of higher productivity gains to compensation.  This situation puzzles me quite a bit because, historically, by now we would be seeing more robustness of compensation, not just real disposable income, but compensation.  We have not seen that.  Productivity apparently continues to move fairly strongly.  Looking forward, I am concerned about this area even though the current data seem to suggest that the costs of labor are perfectly reasonable.  Rather than looking just at the current data but using a little theory to look forward suggests that this may be an area that could be coming up in the future. Even if there are higher costs in the labor market, are they going to be pushed through to final demand prices?  We have had a good discussion of the evidence on what has happened in the past.  Will you necessarily see the margins staying up or moving down, and will that cause the changes in underlying cost to be passed forward?  Potentially it won’t, and potentially there could be large movements.  But, again, we are in somewhat uncharted territory.  We do not have a lot of evidence here. Another set of puzzles concerns the yield curve term premiums, and we, of course, have already had a lot of discussion about those and about the slight uptick in both the survey-based and market-based measures of inflation expectations.  Obviously, that is something that we need to be very, very concerned about because the last thing that we want is to allow our actions in any way to be interpreted as a lack of concern about inflation, which could lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.  That said, I certainly do not see such unanchoring in the markets.  Also, the yield curve, although it has certainly moved up from being flat or even slightly negative, is still showing a difference between the two-year and the ten-year of only 15-20 basis points, which is not very large.  And the much flatter yield curves are a worldwide phenomenon, driven by factors not just within the United States and not just about U.S. expectations. I also very much agree with President Stern that we should not put too much emphasis on high- frequency numbers.  We have to think about the recent numbers in a more systematic way.  What are we likely to see going forward?  What are the risks going forward, given some theory, given some historical experience? Coming back to the theme that I sang about last time—about Fed credibility not being the impossible dream, but a reality—I think we do have that reality, and it is certainly something we do not want to give up.  Just to tweak President Geithner a bit, I hope his comments should not be interpreted as saying that we want to introduce uncertainty into the marketplace.  The last thing that the FOMC should be doing is introducing uncertainty.  Certainly we do not want to be producing moral hazard and having inappropriately low uncertainty when real risk factors may be out there.  We certainly want to be very wary of that; we do not want to contribute to that.  But as Tim said, and I very much agree, we are in a very uncertain time, and to suggest that we are uncertain about where the economy is going is valuable.  But to suggest that the market participants are not focusing enough on uncertainty, that there should be more uncertainty, and that we should do something about it is perhaps not the way to go.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"187";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our readings on the Fifth District’s economy very much parallel those for the nation as a whole.  I’ll be brief.  Surveys show a marked pickup in manufacturing shipments and orders in March and April and ongoing growth in services activities. Retail sales indicators edged higher in April.  The real estate market showed signs that residential activity is softening and commercial activity is firming. Our measures of District price pressures have stepped up significantly in recent weeks.  In the service sector, we ask about current price trends, and we get these quantitative measures and rates of increase.  In the service sector, the current inflation measure is back up to its post-Katrina peak and is higher than at any time since 2003.  We ask about expected six-month inflation.  For the service sector, that has drifted up since Katrina and is now at 3.2 percent, higher than at any point since our survey began in the early ’90s.  In the manufacturing sector, prices received rose 2.4 percent, also a record high, and prices paid also surged in April.  The vast majority of our contacts who have commented on this believe that higher energy prices will persist throughout 2006, and about three-quarters of them say that they will raise their prices in response. Turning to the national economy, on the real side the recent indicators have been generally upbeat and point to continued healthy growth.  I won’t enumerate them.  Unfortunately, I think the inflation picture has become substantially more troubling to me over the intermeeting period.  The March numbers, as others have noted, were certainly eye-catching.  The core price index was up at an annual rate of 3.9 percent, even restricting attention to the market-based components that Governor Kohn prefers.  [Laughter] Of course, month-to-month numbers are noisy, as David indicated, but the core PCE index was up at a rate of 2.5 percent over the past three months and 2.4 percent since August.  In addition, the outlook for inflation going forward has deteriorated as well, and we have had a fairly thorough discussion in the Q&A, so I’ll skip my planned recitation of the indicators.  My sense is that inflation expectations have deteriorated markedly. I don’t want to be too alarmist.  Inflation spreads are still a bit below where they were two years ago, so I think it is possible to characterize inflation expectations as contained, although the size of the requisite container keeps getting bigger and bigger as time goes on.  [Laughter]  Right now it’s bigger than I’d like to see.  My concern is less about the current level of expected inflation than it is about how those expectations have responded to incoming data.  We saw an adverse move in inflation expectations last fall after Katrina, accompanied by conjectures that we might pause.  Inflation expectations seemed to subside as retail gasoline prices fell, but I think it helped substantially that we stuck with our rate increases and communicated pretty forcefully in the fall about our concerns about inflation. This time around, rising energy prices have led to upward revisions in market participants’ expectations about our policy path, along with upward revisions to their expectations regarding inflation. I would have been far happier, however, had they marked up their expected policy path by more and marked up their inflation expectations by less, especially at longer horizons.  I’m particularly distressed by instances in the past several weeks in which the two moved in opposite directions.  That is to say, inflation expectations rose simultaneous with our expected policy path falling.  President Yellen talked about overreacting.  Certainly no one wants to overreact, but I think in situations like this a distinct reaction is warranted.  Thank you.,   Yes, we do on the manufacturing side:  We have prices paid and prices received.  In the service sector, we don’t distinguish; we just ask.  And we have separate retail and nonretail service sectors.  On the manufacturing side, they are always pessimistic, so prices received never seem as though they’re going up as fast as prices paid, especially in the last couple of years.  But over time, if you look at their movements from month to month, you can get a distinct sense.  They really moved up markedly in the fall, tapered off a little and softened in the winter, and now have moved up markedly again and are at or above where they were before."
"188";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most of my business contacts indicated that overall economic activity remains on a solid footing and that resource utilization has tightened further. Both of the major temporary-help firms headquartered in our District said that hiring remains strong nationwide.  They continued to say that skilled workers are in short supply.  This topic was also on the minds of our contacts in manufacturing and construction.  As I’ve noted previously, we’ve heard a few reports from manufacturers that labor shortages were causing delays in supplier deliveries.  Strengthened labor demand, however, has not yet spread to lower-skilled workers.  So while wages for skilled individuals continue to increase briskly, pay rates for other workers are up only modestly. We’re also seeing signs of pressure on nonlabor resources.  Some of our contacts have run into problems with the costs and availability of trucking and rail shipping capacity, and a manufacturer of drilling equipment reported supply disruptions because its vendors were heavily backlogged.  Several contacts noted that price pressures have intensified for many commodities, as we’ve discussed before. Of course, everyone was talking about the surge in energy costs.  Some retailers noted that sales had slowed, and they attributed the softness to higher energy prices.  Others were concerned about the impact of energy going forward.  In contrast, our manufacturing contacts reported that they generally have no plans to scale back production in response to the recent increases. There is not much new to report on the Delphi negotiations.  The period for Delphi workers to sign up for early retirement is just starting.  Delphi, General Motors, and the UAW hope that many will accept the buyout.  This would leave fewer union workers vulnerable to being laid off as Delphi downsizes, which would make the negotiations easier for all the parties involved. On a final note, several of my directors continue to be concerned about the amount of liquidity in financial markets.  They say prices and terms for more and more deals are bordering on speculative. Turning to the outlook, we’ve had quite a bit of news since our last meeting.  Much of it suggests increased risks on the inflation front.  Of course, the March reading on core inflation was just one month, but the twelve-month change in core PCE inflation is now back up to 2 percent.  And as President Lacker said, the six-month change is now up to 2.4 percent.  Moreover, energy prices have jumped again.  The dollar has weakened a bit more, and inflation expectations have risen. In response to the latest data, the forecasts from our indicator models of inflation have moved up some.  Currently, these project 2007 core PCE inflation between 2 percent and 2.4 percent.  To be sure, things are far from getting out of hand:  Resource utilization measures currently are only modestly on the tight side, and we are all well aware of the uncertainty surrounding those measures.  Furthermore, the recent ECI data suggest that wage pressures remain muted.  That said, other measures of wage growth have been rising. Looking at the markup of prices over labor costs, one would think that there’s plenty of room for profit margins to absorb higher wages.  But as Bill Poole suggested in the issue we discussed before, the business people I talked to haven’t gotten that message.  Their attempts to maintain margins in the face of increasing costs represent an upside risk to the inflation outlook.  So I agree with the upward nudge to the Greenbook inflation forecast, but I’d go a bit further.  Given the Greenbook path for the funds rate, I think core inflation of 2¼ percent is a more reasonable point forecast for 2007. In terms of growth, the expansion still appears solid.  The softening in housing that we have been anticipating is more obvious now.  There’s a possibility that moderation might turn to something bigger, but I don’t see this as a large risk.  Of course, $3-a-gallon gasoline should restrain demand somewhat, and we’ll need to keep a close eye on how consumers respond to yet another hit to their purchasing power.  But employment continues to rise at a good pace, generating healthy increases in income, which should support household demand.  Businesses are supporting spending on capital goods, and growth prospects abroad continue to suggest some optimism on export demand.  So I think growth will average around potential over the course of the projection period.,   Wait a minute.  I have to make a two-handed intervention on that one. [Laughter]"
"189";"MR. OLSON.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Mid-May in an election year is a good time to look at the effect of the fiscal budget on the economy.  In an election year, any legislation that has not largely moved toward passage by Memorial Day likely is not going to happen.  We have seen reports of federal receipts received to this point, and we have a good idea about what the budget impact would be. The staff estimate now is that the 2006 budget deficit will be about $100 billion less than the original estimate of the Administration.  That would be equal to 2.2 percent of GDP in ’06, compared with 2.6 percent in ’05.  The improvement is largely revenue driven; as David indicated, government spending is up.  Through April, revenues are up 15 percent from ’05 and, for April and May, up 25 percent over the previous year.  Reasons for the increase will not be entirely known for a while, but there are several candidates.  David Wilcox and others suggested capital gains—although if you use as benchmarks the distributed capital gains for mutual funds or the capital gains that may have resulted from stock market activity in ’05, it seems unlikely to be a strong candidate.  Capital gains from real estate investments, given the exclusion allowed for couples selling a primary residence, also is not a strong candidate.  So there are two other possibilities.  One is that the BEA may be underestimating the income from Sub-S corporations that is passed through to individual tax returns or from income from partnerships.  Another may be that there is a redistribution of income toward the higher tax brackets and therefore the unavoidability of the alternative minimum tax.  Also, corporate income taxes are up again, indicating the very strong underlying economy. On the legislative front, we have a tax bill.  An agreement was reached on a tax reconciliation bill. It pushed out one more year the alternative minimum tax that expired in 2005 and extended for two more years the lower rates on dividends and capital gains set to expire in 2008.  There will be a second tax bill that is right now tied to the pension reform bill.  A supplemental appropriations bill has passed the House and the Senate.  The House version is at $92 billion; the Senate version, $109 billion.  The President has indicated that he would veto the Senate version should it move forward.  That would be his first veto during his term as President.  There is no indication whatsoever that any portion of the President’s tax panel’s report from last fall will be realized in any tax legislation soon or be an issue in the 2006 election.  That is not a surprise.  The tax panel members last fall indicated that, because of the timing of its release, the report was unlikely to generate legislation, and they specifically did not put the report in legislative language, indicating that they instead wanted to talk more broadly about tax policy. Budget resolutions have passed the Senate but not the House.  The House is still debating the level of the budget resolution they would want to pass for ’07.  There is more focus in this Congress than we have seen recently on budget issues.  The focus is not driven by any effort whatsoever to reimpose, for example, a PAYGO provision, but the earmarking process that had basically hijacked the appropriations process and generated some focus on roads to nowhere and bridges to nowhere has brought about a rethinking in some quarters as to whether or not there ought to be renewed budget focus. Overall, the net effect is that both spending and revenues in ’06 and probably ’07 will be back to their fifty-year averages, which is to say about 18 percent of GDP on the revenue side and 20 percent on the spending side, although the swings obviously from year to year have been very dramatic.  Thus, in the near term, there will not be a surprise effect on the budget and therefore on the economy.  However, the report that was issued this week by the trustees of Medicare and Social Security revised only slightly the time frame within which those two spending areas will overwhelm the budget if not ultimately addressed—and there is no indication that will happen.  That is the report from the congressional side for now.,   He had to rub it in.  [Laughter]"
"190";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m not going to try to help you on that one. [Laughter]  I’m going to try to be very brief here because I want to reserve more of my fair share of the time to the policy discussion. One of the problems with the anecdotal reports, of course, is the unsystematic way in which we do them.  I’m well aware that some of the answers you get depend on the way you phrase the questions. Some of my contacts say that the economy is doing fine, no real problems.  One of my contacts from the trucking industry said that the economy looks pretty stable—“boringly normal” is the way he put it.  I don’t have any contacts, though, who say that they see any sign of weakness.  They’re not complaining about signs of weakness, and some of the contacts are saying that things are pretty doggone strong.  So that’s my attempt to filter the observation. Now, let me just give you a couple of particularly interesting anecdotes.  My Wal-Mart contact talked about construction costs.  He said even in Indiana, which is not known as one of the great growth states in this country—,   Okay.  Anyway, he said that their construction costs—for a store, I guess—have come in 27 percent above expectations.  Their construction costs are even higher in the Gulf Coast area. He also said that Wal-Mart is in the process of raising starting wages in about 700 stores.  This is the first time in eight years of talking with him that I’ve heard any comment like that.  He said that some of the raises are part of the Wal-Mart, I’ll call it “social/political,” agenda because of all the controversy about Wal-Mart.  But he said about 125 of these were market driven, that they have plenty of labor in rural areas and in urban areas, but they are developing a labor supply problem for their stores in suburban areas.  Suburban areas are strong. I have received some unsolicited e-mail messages—well, I guess to be fair they’re sort of solicited.  [Laughter]  These are from two directors:  “Heavy construction industry is really hot.  In the past month, I have received reports of a second round of capital cost increases of 25 to 40 percent in the refining industry, and the same for construction of large power plants.  These estimates follow similar increases last summer.”  Another message discussed pressures on the cost of construction materials.  I won’t read the whole thing.  It says, “We believe we are now on the front side of a real surge in prices that will mainly affect highly volatile commodity building products—steel, copper, aluminum, and zinc. However, if it is sustained, it will ripple across a broad range of more-manufactured products.” Now, very briefly, I’ve made a list of what I think are classic inflation warning signs, and I’ll just rattle these off very quickly.  Inflation expectations—we’ve talked about that.  Dollar depreciation. Commodity prices are really breaking out of a trading range that has prevailed for about fifteen years— if you look at the chart in the Greenbook Part 2, you’ll see that.  The surge in construction costs—I think there is a building boom indicating business confidence, and, of course, a direct source of aggregate demand.  Relatively low risk spreads, making it easy for firms to raise capital.  Strong stock market. Strong corporate profits.  From our anecdotal information, some increase in pricing power.  And a worldwide boom.  There is growth in almost every region of the world, and, of course, that translates to some extent into price pressures everywhere, including goods that we import and goods that we export, at least eventually.  I’ll stop there.  Thank you.,   Wal-Mart, of course, follows those numbers very closely.  My contact said that it’s very difficult to sort out what happens when Easter moves the way it does, particularly this time.  He said he would just take March and April together.  Those two months together came in at 3.8 percent, same-store comparison year over year, and they had 3.9 in their plan—3.8 versus 3.9.  That came in just about exactly as they had anticipated.  He did say that they are observing a clear response to the gasoline price increases.  They are seeing fewer trips to the store, a decline or less growth in the number of sales tickets, and an increased number of sales on each sales ticket, which is a logical thing for consumers to do."
"191";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The District economy continues to perform well, and the ongoing expansion is broadly based.  Given that summary, let me just comment on three particular areas, beginning with a few things of interest that came out of a breakfast we had a couple of weeks ago with the leaders of the Twin Cities financial community. First, hiring costs reportedly are rising significantly in order to attract college graduates and those with advanced degrees.  This has implications for salaries more broadly because of internal compression and retention issues—perhaps not a surprise given the duration of the expansion and the gains in employment over the past several years. Second, and this is largely by way of confirming things that have been in the press lately, distinctions between the activities of commercial banks and much more specialized firms like hedge funds, venture capitalists, and private equity firms are diminishing, as the last group is invading the banks’ turf, especially in providing credit of one form or another to business.  This was also a theme at a financial institutions dinner I attended a few weeks earlier.  These competitive pressures may help to explain the results from the latest survey of senior loan officers indicating further easing of standards and terms for C&I (commercial and industrial) loans. The third area I want to comment on is housing.  Data through April show that activity in the District in terms of starts and permits is running so far this year at about the same pace that it ran last year. However, according to a variety of anecdotal reports, speculative building is slowing dramatically if not stopping altogether, and the high end of the housing market, interestingly enough, is doing better, perhaps far better, than the lower tiers.  There are reports of price softening in the middle part of the market.  Given the volume of projects that are currently under way in the District, I would judge that the inventory of unsold homes, especially of condominiums, will continue to rise, and the pace of price increase will moderate further, if not turn negative in some markets. As to the national economy, growth appears to me to be healthy and is likely to be well sustained as best I can determine.  Still, I think that there are a few straws in the wind that suggest that some deceleration is in the offing, including the evolution of housing activity and the diminution of the positive wealth effect, at least from that source.  I do not want to exaggerate that effect at this moment.  It is based largely on what we are seeing in the most recent data, but the anecdotes, at least that I am getting, are consistent with that. Also, while it seems pretty clear that the economy has weathered the run-up in energy prices well, we should not lose sight of its negative implications for real incomes and ultimately for spending.  As for inflation, here it seems to me that uncertainty about the outlook has increased, as the core numbers have come in a touch above what I had earlier anticipated.  Also, inflation expectations appear to have deteriorated.  Still, in my experience, it is not a good idea to overemphasize high-frequency observations, and as a consequence of that, I am not ready yet to raise my inflation forecast."
"192";"MR. STONE.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District continues to advance at a solid pace.  Growth in our region has been steadier than in the nation over the past two quarters.  Payroll employment grew in each of the three states through March, and the three-state unemployment rate is now 4½ percent.  Our business contacts in the region report increased difficulty in filling open positions.  In addition, our employment diffusion index in the business outlook survey rose sharply in April.  Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace.  In response to a special survey question in April, the majority of participants said that underlying demand for their products was increasing. On the retail side, performance looks solid.  Some of that is seasonal.  On the auto side, sales have picked up slightly, but we see some small dealerships actually going out of business.  Our retailers have expressed less concern than I’ve heard around the table about the impact of gasoline prices on their sales going forward. While initial reports of nonresidential construction contracts in our region have declined in recent months, demand for office and industrial space in the District continues to strengthen.  The office market absorption rate is rising in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, and vacancy rates are declining in both the city and the suburbs.  Results of the special survey conducted by the Reserve Bank suggest that commercial construction activity is somewhat softer in our District than in the nation as a whole. Nonetheless, our contacts do see a stronger picture this year than they did last year.  In the residential sector, home sales have slowed since the winter.  Inventories and time on the market have increased. Demand has fallen particularly for higher-priced homes, more so than for lower-priced homes, and house-price appreciation is slowing in our region. Prices for industrial goods are rising, and construction firms are reporting some shortages of structural materials.  Some area builders are starting to stockpile copper, aluminum, and steel for upcoming projects.  Employers in a number of industries in our region report that they have paid higher salaries for workers this year compared with hires in similar positions last year.  At this time of the year, we usually are traveling around the District and conferring with bankers and other businesses as we’re doing our annual field meetings.  Over the past week, we were in the typically most depressed areas of our District—the far western part of our District—and for the first time in many years I was hearing optimism about the future and reports of an actual substantial decline in the unemployment rates in those areas. Turning to the national conditions, our economic outlook is broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline.  However, we see somewhat more economic strength and somewhat higher inflation going forward.  We also note that many forecasters have also revised up their forecasts of the second quarter based on the strength of incoming data.  Business spending and manufacturing continue to show strength.  Notwithstanding the April unemployment report, which came in lower than expected, employment remains strong.  Monthly gains have accelerated to an average of 173,000 jobs this year, compared with 165,000 last year.  Employment growth will support consumer spending even as house- price appreciation slows.  The rising gasoline prices will have a damping effect but probably not a dramatic one.  There are no signs of a sharp retrenchment in housing.  So far, the slowing has been orderly.  With the economy expected to remain at full employment and with labor markets tight, we expect hourly compensation growth to accelerate over the forecast period, but not dramatically so. I recognize that higher oil prices and higher long-term interest rates pose a downside risk to growth and that the downturn in housing and the monetary policy tightening already in the pipeline could prove to be a bigger drag than anticipated.  But in my view, given the underlying strength of the economy, the risks to growth are roughly balanced or perhaps even tilted modestly to the upside. I have somewhat more concern about inflation over the intermeeting period.  It’s true that we haven’t seen an acceleration in core inflation measured year over year.  But at shorter horizons, as has been previously mentioned, we’ve seen a marked uptick in core inflation.  In addition, inflation forecasts have been revised up, reflecting the recent higher-than-expected inflation data and the view that higher oil prices might add to inflationary pressures.  Longer-run inflation expectations, as measured by the TIPS and the Michigan survey, as reported earlier, are apparently up somewhat, which is troubling to me.  Higher productivity growth will help to keep inflation in check.  With inflation running at the top of the range that I consider consistent with price stability and with the economy operating at high levels of resource utilization, there’s a risk that stronger inflation pressures could emerge.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"193";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I hesitate to joke here at my second FOMC.  I made a joke at my first that the inaugural meeting requires the new Governors to sing, and my colleague took me up on that.  [Laughter]  So I will not offer a joke about dancing this time.  [Laughter]  In the interest of time. [Laughter] Going to the central tendency in terms of where the economy is, I suppose I consider myself much more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast about the state of the economy.  I think some of the shocks to the economy, energy prices being the latest, speak in some ways to the durability, the flexibility, and the resilience of this economy which, on the one hand, I shake my head about but, on the other hand, I think we have to believe to some degree. I will not go into too many of the facts, which have already been described, but consumption was up 5½ percent in the first quarter.  Business capital expenditures were up about 16½ percent on an annualized basis, with strong durable goods orders.  And the increase in tax receipts that Governor Olson spoke about is a very good leading indicator, even though some of the details behind that increase are hard to know. President Poole referenced the growth in corporate profits.  Let me add a couple of notes on that. What we are really seeing in the equity capital markets is, by and large, profitability-driven growth in the S&P and in the Dow as opposed to some sort of P/E multiple expansion.  It does give some of us more confidence in the strength that we are seeing in the equity capital markets as well as another source of optimism as to what some of the income-statement benefits might be to consumers. As we think about what might be the elephants in the markets, certainly the housing market is one from FOMC meetings that preceded my time here.  The new elephants in the market in terms of tone and tenor are inflation and inflation expectations.  I would like to talk about them more in just a moment. When we look at the data since our last meeting, though there is a lot of noise, on balance I share the view that they tend to be more positive than expectations.  Average nonfarm payroll growth in the past six months was almost 200,000, including the April figure, and the idea of less-robust labor markets appears belied by the solid gains that we have seen in hours worked, the acceleration in wages, and the low unemployment rate, which is still at 4.7 percent.  So our thinking about a possible slowdown in the second half of the year has to at least be balanced or perhaps partly counterbalanced by what could be the first meaningful gains in take-home pay for nonsupervisory workers.  Understanding those income-statement benefits to real consumers is probably a more certain exercise at this point than trying to figure out the effect on the consumer of the housing markets, which Governor Bies spoke about. On the business front, I am at least as optimistic as I was six weeks ago about the state of business investment.  CEOs, when they have seen the appreciation of share prices in the last quarter, even as they have seen prices appreciate for many of their competitors, remain more robust, more excited, and, I think, more eager to spend money. We have seen an increase in the backlog in debt underwriting by most of the big bulge-bracket firms, and so though some of that money is, no doubt, being spent on stock repurchases, some debt is being raised in expectation of merger and acquisition activity.  At least part of it is based on a view that, as there is more uncertainty priced in the markets for the second half, companies are getting their ducks in a row to obtain some extra liquidity. Let me make one final point before briefly talking about inflation.  I am encouraged, like the rest of you, about the synchronized global growth that we are talking about.  My biggest concern, particularly in May of an election year, is about what is likely to be a bipartisan foray into creeping protectionism in the dialogue of politicians here in Washington between now and the November elections.  The position discussions about free trade that we have heard on both sides of the aisle over the past several years are, I think, going to diminish very significantly.  There could also be many more discussions in highly contested congressional election districts about the need to isolate the U.S. markets, to cut ourselves off from a lot of foreign opportunities.  To be candid, the business community probably isn’t that eager to enter this debate with a message oriented toward free trade.  So I do think that creeping protectionism may become stronger between now and November and will have consequences for our economy to integrate with foreign markets and to continue to expand.  We may have more difficulty fighting back in some of the export markets, even with some depreciation of the dollar.  The Federal Reserve has a possible role in trying to moderate some of that discussion. Finally, just a moment on inflation:  I guess the way I would characterize it from a market perspective, and I think this is consistent with Dino’s and the Vice Chairman’s comments, is that market expectations of inflation are more fragile than they were some months ago.  I would not describe myself as an alarmist about that.  However, the traders at many of the securities firms and the folks who are hitting the trading buttons are contemporaries of mine.  They are from a generation that has not experienced inflation at first hand the way that some folks around this table have.  The psychological point of that statement is that, though we may have seen some laxity in their concern about inflation over the preceding six months and even today, that laxity could turn into some irrationality if inflation expectations get above our reasonable expectations and our comfort level.  On balance, I think that the markets, particularly those marginal traders, are looking for some leadership from the Federal Reserve.  Perhaps we have seen somewhat less market discipline in the TIPS markets and in some of the other markets, such as commodities.  Other folks have spoken more eloquently than I about what is happening in the TIPS markets and some of the dangerous signs in the surveys, so I will only offer two final notes. First, on the energy market side and on the commodity side, it is harder and harder to describe the run-up in prices as solely or even predominantly demand driven.  When I think about the new retail products that are now finding their way to typical broker–dealer relationships at retail-oriented chains, I see a massive surge of inflows into new silver-oriented mutual funds and copper-oriented exchange-traded funds.  A lot of that speculative money is coming very late into these markets, and that situation should suggest to us that some folks, rightly or wrongly, are assigning some sort of inflation hedge to that product, with retail investors, as usual, being the last to get in on it. Finally, on the energy front, I have been thinking about the difference between where we are now and where we might be several months from now.  I was encouraged by the same-store sales numbers that we saw in April, even in March and April together.  Those numbers are very encouraging, but as we get into the summer driving season, the energy prices may be seen as persistent.  The market may take a view that the higher prices are more permanent than most consumers believe now, and I think that’s probably an extra reason for our caution on the inflation front.  So on balance, Mr. Chairman, I am quite optimistic about the strength of the economy but at least as leery about the expectations for inflation going forward."
"194";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  My husband will attest to that.  [Laughter],   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparing for the meeting, one of the things I focused on was the graph that I like that tracks the staff forecasts over time because I am really torn between where I see growth going and where I see inflation expectations.  In looking at the graph, one can clearly see, if you look back through Greenbooks to September ’05, that staff forecasts of core PCE inflation have been basically flat whereas real GDP growth forecasts for this year have increased quite a bit.  The ’07 numbers are stable at a lower inflation rate and a lower growth rate. But what troubles me so much, and somebody already mentioned it, is how much the various indicators of core inflation have picked up over recent periods in the actual data.  As President Lacker mentioned, we have core PCE up 2.4 percent in the past couple of quarters.  We have core CPI up 2.7 percent.  If you look at core GDP prices over the whole of last year, you are running at just under 3 percent over that period; and that is without what we cannot quite measure yet, which is how much energy prices are passing through.  The longer companies see that energy prices are going to remain high or go even higher—instead of being just a one-shot hurricane effect—the more likely we are to see some of these prices being passed through.  So I am getting concerned about whether the lagged effects of the monetary policy changes so far are going to be enough to moderate the inflation that we are now observing to reach the goal of lower core inflation numbers in ’07. On the real side, one area that I think is critical is the housing market.  As you all know, I have continued to worry about what is going on in housing and mortgages and have wanted to give you another perspective on what we are observing.  Most of you are well aware that we put out some supervisory guidance for comment awhile back on nontraditional mortgage loans, which include various forms of interest-only, adjustable-rate, negative-amortization mortgages.  If you look at the 2005 earnings reports of the large mortgage banks and the large savings and loans that do mortgage lending, these institutions have a really striking amount of interest rate risk embedded in their negative amortization loans.  As you know, most of the product is securitized and sold.  So the relative share of these products originated in the last couple of years that are on the banks’ books is small overall.  But the numbers have gotten so bad that now the setters of accounting standards want banks to disclose how much interest income they are recognizing as income that they have not collected, through this negative amortization.  In other words, they bill the customer for this interest, but instead of making the customer give them the cash every month, they just add the amount to the outstanding balance and it creates negative amortization.  For some of these big organizations, the amount represents 5 or 10 percent of net income from last year.  So the number is growing, and we are looking to make sure that banks are appropriately putting aside reserves for the portion that may not be collectible. In the past few weeks, I have become aware that the rising interest rates are creating more problems for customers in servicing debt.  What President Hoenig has observed in Colorado in interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages is just the beginning.  The Greenbook showed how much the subprime sector is going up; and we know, because ARMs are a big chunk of those mortgages, that it is starting to be felt.  As we go forward and more of these ARMs, especially those that have three-year lock-in periods, start to reprice, we will be seeing more of it. Now, the mortgage industry, ever creative and ever worrying about the ability of homeowners to pay amid rising rates, has now decided to create negative-amortization, fixed-rate mortgages.  What these mortgages do is say, “Just borrow for your house.  You have a monthly payment, no amortization of principal, and you do not even have to pay the full fixed rate.  We will just continue to add to your principal, and you pay what you can afford every month versus what you really owe us on the fixed rate every month.”  This process just continues, and one thing that bothers me for the long run is the extent to which housing could slow this year and slow the economy.  I just wonder about the consumer’s ability to absorb shocks.  The buildup of home equity and the ability to borrow against it have helped individual homeowners when they have had layoffs, medical problems, divorces—all the things in life that create month-to-month problems for cash flow.  With the growth of negative amortization, home equity is not being built up anymore.  Negative amortization clearly helps consumer spending because consumers, in effect, have a smaller amount of their take-home pay that has to go to the mortgage payment every month, and so it is available to be spent elsewhere.  It is probably a more pernicious type of home equity withdrawal because you don’t take an action to withdraw it.  Now it is planned that you will have negative amortization.  It clearly changes the way we look at the role of savings as a precautionary balance to get the consumer through bad times, and it also has long-run implications regarding the importance of asset values vis-à-vis default rates both for the banking sector and for the household sector. So the growing ingenuity in the mortgage sector is making me more nervous as we go forward in this cycle, rather than comforted that we have learned a lesson.  Some of the models the banks are using clearly were built in times of falling interest rates and rising housing prices.  It is not clear what may happen when either of those trends turns around."
"195";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Current economic conditions are fair to good in New England.  Consumers report rising confidence, at least in the current situation. Manufacturers report solid domestic and international demand.  Business confidence is also good relative to the current situation.  Unemployment claims and online job postings suggest continuing positive employment momentum.  Northern-tier tourism was hurt by lackluster winter weather, but reportedly tourism in Boston has been quite strong.  And even with the poor winter season, tax revenues have grown considerably above budget in all but Rhode Island. On the not-so-hot side, residential real estate markets apparently have slowed, particularly at the high end, with rising inventories of unsold expensive homes.  Reportedly, however, more moderately priced homes continue to sell, though transaction volumes for the region as a whole are trailing off. Average selling prices for single-family homes continue to increase according to conventional home price indexes, the last ones of which we had for the final quarter of last year.  More-recent anecdotes also suggest that they have been increasing.  However, the rates of increase are down to single digits. To some contacts, the market, though slower, seems healthier and more realistic. From a wide range of contacts I have spoken with since the last meeting, I want to highlight three concerns.  First, rising costs for energy, transportation, and raw materials are pushing price increases.  These are more likely to be tolerated by customers than in the recent past.  And firms that say they are unable to pass on such increases report that they expect considerable bottom-line deterioration as a result.  Second, skilled labor across a wide range of industries is harder to find and expensive, though planned overall wage increases do not seem to be larger than a year ago.  So there is some issue here of skilled labor versus unskilled labor differentials.  Finally, there is a general worry, despite pretty good current economic conditions, that energy and energy-related costs will eat into consumer demand and, combined with the flattening in housing markets, will affect growth prospects. Now, on the national scene, our forecast is just about the same as the Greenbook’s.  Growth slows for the rest of this year to next and in ’07 is slightly below potential.  Unemployment rises slightly, even with continued pretty good job growth.  Inflation first rises and then falls.  It’s the same general forecast we’ve had for a while.  But the question is where the risks to this forecast are.  To me they seem to have risen, perhaps on both sides, but I’d say they’re a bit tilted to higher price growth.  Q1 growth was clearly above expectations.  Some of this was frontloaded into January.  April employment was on the slow side; there is some evidence of slowing in housing markets, though prices continue to rise; and household wealth, including stock market wealth, is rising as well. The longer end of the yield curve has turned up, tightening financial conditions somewhat, though corporate profits remain strong and credit spreads remain narrow.  It’s possible we’re seeing consumer spending slow, but business spending has strengthened.  Thus, while the best guess is that the trajectory for growth is downward, how much and how fast remains uncertain and is a part more of the forecast than of the current picture. On the other hand, although incoming core inflation data have tracked only a bit above what we had expected, I’m not comfortable with what might be called the inflation atmosphere.  With inflation compensation and inflation expectations rising, the dollar falling, and gasoline prices around $3 a gallon, it seems to me that inflation risks really have tilted somewhat.  I know that each of these may turn out to be transitory.  It’s also true that, as yet, indications of wage pressures have been mixed, and while productivity growth has been trending lower, it remains quite healthy.  The global competition that characterized much of the past ten years remains healthy, and profit margins are wide enough on average to absorb the rising input costs related to a growing world. Still, anticipating core PCE price growth at 2½ percent, as the Greenbook does for this quarter, makes me at least pause.  Given the six-month and the three-month rates of growth in core PCE, a slowing in rates of price growth, while expected, still is only part of the forecast. In sum, although the forecast is rosy—perhaps a bit too rosy—risks to the realization of that forecast appear to have risen.  Some of these may be on the downside, but we are also at a point where estimating the economy’s remaining capacity is difficult, and the atmosphere of the inflation picture has changed.  So though I don’t want to overreact or be accused of doing so, I am less sure than I was at our last meeting about both where we are and where we need to be."
"196";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Based on the reports from my directors and my business contacts in the Fourth District, the relatively broad-based growth of the first quarter appears to have carried over into April.  However, their comments about the balance of the year are consistent with the moderating trend of the Greenbook baseline projection. To put it in terms used by the Conference Board’s consumer sentiment measures, the current condition index is high, but the expectations index is falling.  I was reminded by my staff as we were preparing for this meeting that real-time data on real economic growth are difficult to assess.  At the end of our rate-increase cycle in 2000, the GDP figures were providing unreliable signals about the underlying strength of the economy.  We had a second quarter that had real growth of more than 6 percent.  We were forecasting, and even saw in the advance figures a very strong third quarter, and yet we had negative growth in that quarter. Comments I hear about price pressures contain some mixed messages.  I don’t hear many complaints about price pressures except for the obvious ones about the energy-related costs and material shortages in construction-related businesses.  However, I am hearing concerns about the persistence of these costs and the possibility that they may have negative consequences for both inflation and overall business conditions. The consequences of the energy shocks for prices are already apparent.  At our November meeting, I agreed with the Board staff projection that we would, at about this time, find ourselves facing some pass-through in our core inflation measures from some of the previous energy-price increases.  At that time, however, it also appeared that headline inflation would be coming down at this point. Obviously, the current Greenbook suggests that recent oil shocks have taken that scenario away from us, at least for the immediate future, and the tick-up in expected core inflation is now even further away from my comfort zone than before. That said, based on what I’m hearing from my directors and business contacts, the Greenbook’s assessment of current conditions and baseline projections going forward seem about right to me.  But I sense rather significant perceived risks both that economic growth might turn out weaker than I expect and that inflationary pressures might be larger or even more persistent than I expect.  If we can take any encouragement from this, it would be that similar sentiments were expressed during the run-up in oil and gas prices last fall, and those sentiments did abate fairly quickly when the energy market situation stabilized.  Unlike many of my colleagues who have spoken ahead of me, I do think that the risks are weighted against both of our objectives, and, obviously, that’s not a comfortable place for a monetary policymaker to be in.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"197";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data on the pace of economic activity surprised me slightly to the upside, although the indications are that housing is continuing to cool.  Such an upside surprise is of concern, given that we are probably in the neighborhood of full employment and inflation is already on the high side of a range I consider consistent with price stability.  I have also been slightly surprised, and unpleasantly so, by incoming data on core inflation. Beginning on the real side, recent data might signal greater underlying momentum in aggregate demand, portending more of the same going forward.  But other developments during the intermeeting period portend slower growth this year.  In particular, energy prices and longer-term interest rates have risen surprisingly and substantially.  Taking all these factors into account, we have marked down our forecast for real GDP growth a bit for the latter half of 2006 and for 2007.  We see growth coming in slightly below trend starting in the second half of this year and the unemployment rate moving up toward 5 percent.  This forecast assumes that policy is tightened at this meeting and once more over the next several meetings. One development on which I would like to comment briefly is the rise in long-term interest rates. Since the beginning of this year, the nominal ten-year Treasury rate is up about 75 basis points.  About 50 basis points of this increase is accounted for by a rise in the real component, at least as measured by TIPS rates.  It seems natural to assume that this increase in real long rates will restrain future growth, but the outcome for economic activity is not unambiguous:  It depends on what caused real rates to rise in the first place, and the causation is far from obvious. For example, higher long-term rates could reflect rational market expectations of a significantly stronger domestic economy over the next few years.  But such an explanation does not strike me as particularly plausible because, although recent data are slightly on the strong side, they are not dramatically strong.  Moreover, the uptick in real rates appears to be especially pronounced in implied yields at the long end of the curve—in the distant future, in periods well beyond a plausible forecast horizon. A second possibility is that higher U.S. interest rates reflect a shift in global capital flows away from the United States, perhaps due to the unwinding of the carry trade or growing concern about the U.S. current account deficit.  Such a shift might account for the sharp drop in the dollar over the same period.  In simple models, such a shift in portfolio preferences has ambiguous effects on domestic demand because the depreciation in the dollar could stimulate aggregate demand by more than higher yields depress it.  It’s not my intention to overemphasize the risk that growth will not slow.  My point is simply that, although the rise in bond rates seems likely to help slow the economy, we should not take it for granted. Turning briefly to inflation, I’m uncertain whether the recent bulge reflects various special factors, as David mentioned, some pass-through of energy and commodity prices, or pressures from resource utilization.  Parsing the CPI report, I found it difficult to discern evidence that the uptick does reflect pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core inflation.  I would be quite concerned if the uptick reflects pressures from resource utilization and turns out to be persistent.  However, half a dozen measures of slack that we monitor suggest no noticeable change in slack since late March.  These measures also suggest that we are in the vicinity of full employment and not noticeably beyond it.  Data on both productivity and labor compensation are largely reassuring. My final comment concerns the rise in inflation compensation since our last meeting.  While the possibility of some loss of Fed credibility certainly can’t be dismissed, I believe we should not overreact.  First, the rise we’ve seen is not out of line with the typical volatility in this series.  Second, we must remember that inflation compensation includes not only expected inflation but also an inflation risk premium.  Of course, both of these elements could be higher because of a lessening of credibility. But the inflation risk premium could also be higher because the world now strikes market participants as a riskier place, perhaps because of geopolitical concerns that have nothing to do with credibility. Indeed, a growing perception that the world is riskier could explain both the uptick in inflation compensation due to a rise in the inflation risk premium and some of the rise in TIPS yields due to higher real interest rate risk.  Factor analysis performed by our staff suggests a strong correlation with the common factor for the term premium and longer-horizon, but not shorter-horizon, breakeven inflation rates and TIPS yields. My point is that determining what has caused inflation compensation to go up is not an easy matter, and concluding that it’s due to a lessening of credibility may be premature.  So overall, while we have revised our core inflation forecast up slightly, we continue to be fairly optimistic that inflation will remain reasonably well contained going forward.  Inflation in the core PCE price index of around 2 percent over the next year or so seems like the most likely outcome to us.,   We’ve not tried to estimate an actual breakdown between those two things.  We do look at models that estimate the term premium, but we’ve done some empirical work that suggests simply that movements in inflation compensation, the inflation risk premium, and longer-term TIPS yields tend to be correlated at long horizons.  But I don’t have an estimate of that precise breakdown."
"198";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060510meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The basic contours of our forecast are essentially unchanged since March and are very similar to the Greenbook’s.  However, the balance of risks has changed a little in our view, somewhat to the upside on inflation.  But as in March, we expect core PCE inflation to run a little over 2 percent in ’06 and to moderate slightly below that in ’07 as tighter policy works to slow overall demand growth.  We expect real growth to rise in the vicinity of its potential rate— 3¼, 3½ percent—throughout ’07.  So we are a little higher than the Greenbook in that sense. As before, this forecast rests on some important assumptions:  that little or no slack is left in resource utilization, that inflation expectations are held in check, and that term premiums remain relatively low by historical standards.  The recent moves in medium-term inflation expectations and the rise in the other components of forward interest rates cast some doubts on these last two assumptions.  For these and other reasons, we see a little more uncertainty around our central forecast than we did in our last meeting. However, on the growth outlook, on balance the recent data seem to confirm the picture of real GDP moderating toward potential.  We face the familiar sources of risk to the downside, but not all the risks are to the downside.  We may be underestimating the momentum in final demand growth.  I think it is important to note that it is hard to find evidence in credit spreads or in equity prices of a substantial growth slowdown in prospect. On inflation, recent developments are not all that dark, but neither have they been entirely reassuring.  Let me just go through the factors that we think are critical to the outlook on the inflation side. Almost every measure of underlying inflation that we look at is now above the level we generally associate with price stability.  Headline inflation has been running and is still running substantially above core, and even with interest rates close to long-run measures of equilibrium, the staff forecast does not anticipate much moderation in core inflation over the two-year or even three-year or four-year period.  Compensation growth does not yet appear to have accelerated significantly, and the growth of unit labor costs has remained reassuringly moderate.  However, compensation to us seems likely to strengthen, and it is unlikely that productivity growth is going to accelerate significantly from current levels.  Demand growth is still probably running a bit above potential here and in large parts of the world economy; with real short-term rates still quite low around the world and monetary policy only just beginning to tighten in many of those economies, global pressure on resource utilization may intensify or at least continue at its current intensity rather than moderate.  And the rise in energy prices and commodity prices, of course, suggests a fair amount of strength in global demand. Our assumption that energy prices follow the futures curve means that our forecast is, of course, still vulnerable as it has been over the past three years to further upside surprises.  It would be easier to discount this risk if we could determine with confidence the extent to which temporary supply factors rather than unrecognized or unanticipated strength in global demand have accounted for the trajectory of energy prices over the past few years. We face a lot of uncertainty about the likely path of the dollar, and the prospect of a significantly weaker dollar adds another source of upside risk to inflation and expected future inflation.  We obviously have some uncertainty about the extent to which margins will prove flexible in the face of higher cost pressures. Finally, we have seen a material rise in long-term inflation expectations in the United States over the past several months, and this should make us somewhat less confident that we can assume that the gap between headline and core will be closed with headline moving down to core.  Inflation expectations seem to have risen more here than in other countries, and the recent changes in the relationship between changes in short-term expectations about U.S. monetary policy and changes in breakeven inflation rates is somewhat disconcerting, with expectations deteriorating when statements by Committee members were interpreted as lowering the probability of moves beyond our meeting today.  This pattern is more troubling than the size of the rise in medium-term inflation expectations.  And I just want to make one comment in response to something Janet said.  Even if we could tell with confidence how much of this rise in breakeven inflation was about uncertainty or inflation risk premiums and how much was actually about future expectations about inflation and even if we thought a substantial amount of that was uncertainty, it is not clear that that would be particularly reassuring in terms of credibility or in terms of its implications for monetary policy. So underlying inflation is less contained than we would like it to be, and it is expected to moderate less than we might hope.  Both short-term and long-term measures of expectations have moved up uncomfortably, and we see somewhat greater upside risk to our inflation forecast than we did in March. Now, what might we learn over the next six weeks that would change our view about the outlook and its implications for monetary policy?  We actually think it is unlikely that data are going to provide us with very strong signals that policy is markedly off track, but there are two important things to watch.  One is the behavior of long-term inflation expectations.  If those expectations were to continue to rise, that would obviously be a source of concern; and if inflation expectations were not responsive to changes in expectations about the path of the funds rate, that would also be troubling.  On the data front, we at least will want to watch to see if the expected moderation in manufacturing activity in the United States materializes.  If, in contrast, manufacturing activity here sustains its recent pace, it might suggest that growth abroad has picked up more than we thought or that the dollar is having a bigger effect in stimulating exports than we anticipated.  These conditions would increase concern about upside risks to our central forecast because, of course, that forecast relies on a slowdown in overall domestic demand growth mitigating upward pressure on inflation over the forecast period. Just a few points to end on the topic of uncertainty:  Even though the fundamental news is pretty positive and reassuring, we are now at the point where the limits of our knowledge about the underlying forces that affect the outlook for aggregate demand, supply, and inflation matter more than they have in the recent past.  Relatively small differences, differences well within the limits of our knowledge about trend growth and productivity or employment or other factors, have more impact on our choices about monetary policy in the near term than they would have had over the past two years. What should we conclude from the substantial rise in real forward rates that we have seen over the past few months?  This move, which has occurred across the major economies, brings expected real rates more in line with long-term averages, reducing, if not eliminating, the anomalistic line we had such trouble understanding.  Now, does this mean we have less to do in terms of future tightening than we thought? Maybe.  Or it might mean that monetary policy has been more stimulative than we thought and that we will have to do more to make up for that going forward.  The fact that we cannot fully explain why these measures of expected real rates have moved around as much as they have just adds to the uncertainty we face today about how tight policy actually is.  It is also a bit of a puzzle that measures of uncertainty about future interest rates have not increased very much, and I do think it is important that we try to continue encouraging—it is uncomfortable to say this—or to at least avoid discouraging an increase in uncertainty that is more commensurate with what we are experiencing ourselves.  [Laughter]  Monetary policy works through expectations, but our job is harder when we are not truly sure what we want to do to those expectations.  Trying to make sure that we are not pushing down uncertainty as we continue to make sure that the markets understand that we’re going to work to keep inflation low and stable remains our principal challenge.  Thank you.,   I agree.  I am not sure that the movements are that large and that you can attribute that much to these differences, but I do think you want to look carefully at what happens to those expectations when expectations change about monetary policy in the near term.  It is that pattern which is somewhat disconcerting."
"199";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Well, if we could, I would like to start the economic go-round. If at all possible, I would like to complete that today so everyone could get a chance to speak today.

Governor Bies.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  If I could try your patience for a few more minutes at the end of a long afternoon, I’d like to summarize what I’ve heard today and then just add a few comments of my own.  While I’m doing that, Brian, would you distribute table 1? Table 1 in the Bluebook shows the three alternative suggestions for the statement.  Since the Bluebook, we have received some suggestions, and we’ve done some wordsmithing—we’ve actually responded to a few things we heard today.  The general tone of the three statements is the same, but we wanted you to see where it was today, so that you could think about it overnight and so that it would help you for your discussion tomorrow.  That’s going to be coming around. Let me just briefly summarize what I heard.  Certainly, a central theme of the speakers today was the increase of uncertainty and risk in the environment.  It’s getting more and more difficult to forecast, and there are certainly risks both to the upside and to the downside. The central tendencies with respect to output seem to be that output is slowing to something close to potential.  Some felt growth would be stronger than the Greenbook suggested; others, like the Greenbook, thought it would be falling somewhat below potential.  A few people saw downside risks from previous tightening.  There was some disagreement on the extent to which financial conditions are supportive of the economy, and some disagreement on consumption, although there was a view that lower-income consumers were going to do worse than higher-income consumers.  Housing is certainly slowing.  Some took the view that it was slowing more or less as expected, whereas some thought the slowing was somewhat worse than expected—certainly that’s a source of downside risk.  The view of the labor market is that it remains reasonably healthy, that it’s difficult to find skilled workers, but there are still few signs of wage pressures in the economy.  The business-sector evaluations were much more upbeat, with ongoing expansion, good sentiment, and capital investment.  Finally, there seems to be considerable unease about recent inflation developments.  Everyone considered these recent developments to be unwelcome.  Some felt that the recent increase in inflation might be temporary.  Others saw it as more persistent.  But there certainly was a sense that it’s a risk to the economy. Let me add just a few thoughts about the situation.  The situation is, I think, exceptionally complicated because at least three different things are going on.  First of all, there’s a cyclical transition from a period of above-trend growth to what we would hope would be a period of trend growth, the normal soft-landing problem.  Second, we essentially have a supply shock.  It’s not exactly a supply shock because it has complicated elements to it, but oil prices and commodity prices are rising significantly, and that is creating a worsened tradeoff.  Third, we are having a housing cycle that has a certain autonomous component to it because it’s like any other asset-price correction taking place on its own schedule, so to speak, and it is interacting with the other two forces.  So given these three things occurring at the same time, the situation is obviously very complicated. Now, the ideal situation would be for us to move to a steady, sustainable pace without inflation.  Right now, the biggest risk to that steady pace seems to be the pickup that we’ve seen recently in inflation.  The main point I want to make about inflation—many points have already been made—is that it really is quite broad-based. I think there are good reasons to downweight, to some extent, owners’ equivalent rent.  It is arguably a cost of living; however, the effects of monetary policy on this kind of cost of living are somewhat ambiguous.  So we could get ourselves into a bad situation if we focus on it too much.  But having said that, if you slice, say, core PCE in any other way—if you look, for example, at core PCE prices excluding OER, at core goods, at core PCE services excluding OER, at market-based core PCE less OER, at any of these ways of slicing inflation—you get a similar pattern in terms of the three-month, six-month, and twelve-month averages, which suggests a broad-based acceleration and one that I think we should be concerned about.  We should also note that the three-month total PCE inflation rate is 5.2, which is significant because it influences inflation expectations overall. Now, a concern that we all have—and many people expressed—is that we don’t fully understand why this sudden acceleration is taking place.  Some of the possibilities are, first, the supply-shock increases of energy prices; second, the tight product markets; and third, changes in inflation psychology, perhaps related to headline inflation.  I guess I would just raise the possibility that these three things are interacting.  Perhaps with tighter product markets it’s easier to pass through your energy costs or your commodity costs.  That pass-through interacts with higher inflation psychology, and there’s maybe a vicious cycle there.  The thing we should be concerned about is whether those higher prices then lead to higher wage pressures in an inverse kind of spiral.  So I do have concerns about inflation, although I don’t want to exaggerate.  I think we’re still looking at numbers that are historically not extremely high. The other big issue is the housing cycle.  I’m going to give us a bit of perspective.  It is a good thing that housing is cooling.  If we could wave a magic wand and reinstate 2005, we wouldn’t want to do that because the market has to come back to equilibrium.  The level of activity now is about a third bigger than it was in during the boom in the late 1990s.  The housing construction industry is large, bigger than historically normal, and a controlled decline in housing obviously is helpful to us at this stage in bringing us to a soft landing in the economy. But as people have pointed out, the cooling is an asset-price correction.  Like any other asset-price correction, it’s very hard to forecast, and consequently it is an important risk and one that should lead us to be cautious in our policy decisions, as we’ll talk about tomorrow. Another potential nonlinearity is in financial markets, as we’ve seen recently.  We don’t have a good understanding of how changes in interest rates are affecting risk reduction and positions in financial markets right now. Just a bit of commentary on consumption:  A lot of our uncertainty—I guess you’d call it model uncertainty—is the question about how a decline in housing prices will affect consumer spending.  The range of views is wide, some arguing that, because of equity withdrawal and so on, the effect would be very large.  I don’t know the answer to that question, obviously, but I think there are some positive factors that will support consumption going forward.  To name a few, the job market remains good, unemployment insurance claims are low, unemployment is low, and I suspect that wages and incomes will start to rise sometime soon.  Consumer confidence is not that bad.  Gasoline prices are likely to come down.  In part, they are reflecting high ethanol prices, which will come down over time.  We’ve seen before that consumer confidence can be very sensitive to gasoline prices.  Balance sheets remain reasonably healthy. Even if housing prices flatten out, people have accumulated a lot of equity, and the implication of that is that they can smooth their consumption through rough times, if necessary, by drawing on that equity.  Finally, Kevin and Randy, I think, gave different sides of the surge in tax collections, but on the whole it is probably a positive sign.  It probably suggests there is more economic activity than we are capturing. So let me just conclude by reiterating that we find ourselves in an extraordinarily complicated situation because we have these different themes—the cyclical turning point, the supply shock, and the housing cycle.  The implication is that, whatever we do, we’re going to have to be very deliberate and careful; but I think we cannot ignore the inflation side of this equation. Any other comments?  Well, thank you again for your patience in a long afternoon.  I’m glad this is a two-day meeting.  [Laughter]  Everyone should have table 1; I don’t expect significant changes before tomorrow.  I’ll see you tonight at the British Embassy, and we will reconvene tomorrow morning at 9:00. [Meeting recessed] June 29, 2006—Morning Session,   Good morning, everyone.  Mr. Reinhart."
"200";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Well, Mr. Chairman, last time I described the economy from our perspective as a BMW Z4 roadster that just couldn’t keep itself from exceeding the speed limit.  Based on the series of calls we made in preparation for this meeting and the Beige Book and what we are seeing in our own District, I would say that the real economy has downshifted—but as President Moskow said and as I understood President Lacker and certainly President Stern to have said—not to the degree that is projected in the Greenbook.  I would also say that, just to kill the analogy, the inflation pressure gauge needle is moving upward. I do talk to the CEOs of two of the largest homebuilding companies, and the way I would describe their perspective is that they have migrated from amnesia to déjà vu.  Clearly, the kinds of numbers that you are projecting seem to be confirmed in terms of the default rates still running above 40 percent.  Yet some markets within the country have great strength—Texas, the Carolinas, the Pacific Northwest—which is offsetting the weakness in the Northeast, the desert area, California, and so on. Acknowledging that, I would like just to turn to what we are picking up from the other, nonhousing sectors.  I would summarize their views by quoting the CEO of Cadbury Schweppes. He said that he has heard a great deal about stagflation: “The ‘stag’ is definitely not there; the ‘flation’ is increasing.”  The CEO of EDS, who has as his clients GM and Delphi, said, “You hear a lot about quarter-to-quarter slowdown.  I’m not seeing it in the general economy.” My shipping contacts report that the rate for Panamax ships, which I talked about earlier because Panamax is the most liquid of the bulk carriers and perhaps the best indicator, rose from $16,500 at the last meeting to $22,000 last week.  All the shippers to whom I spoke are revising upward the volume that they expect to ship as well as the revenue they expect to generate. The rails report that they expect the rise in second-quarter GDP to be around 4 percent in terms of their activity level, up from the first quarter.  One indicator is that Burlington Northern Santa Fe reports having shipped 200,000 units a week only one time in 2004, nine times in 2005, and sixteen times this year to date, with an acceleration in April, May, and June. I think all of us saw FedEx’s numbers that were reported.  I spoke at length with the CFO of UPS, who reports that sales were up 6 percent in the first quarter.  As of last week they are forecasting closer to 5 percent for the second quarter.  The CFO said that “there is no dramatic slowdown that we can observe.”  The chairman of an airline that moves 80 million passengers, who last time worried aloud about a slowdown that they were seeing in California, says that in terms of realistic bookings, across the nation it is strong without exception and confirms President Moskow’s point about being able to have some pricing power.  Yet because of capacity constraints in the industry as a whole, this firm is still seeing strong demand and strong growth potential. The retailers, I would say, are divided into two groups.  The higher price points continue to do well.  To quote the CEO of JCPenney: “What I am seeing through my business is not what I am hearing on CNBC or hearing from the Wall Street analysts.”  On the other hand, those at the lower price points—and I have two extremes here, 7-Eleven and Wal-Mart, in terms of their average sale and size—are clearly coming under pressure due to gasoline prices.  But one thing that I heard in talking with the CEO of the world largest retailer was that “there is a lot of pricing pressure”; and for the first time I heard the following: “We have pricing power, and we are passing it through.” You see this statement confirmed in terms of the anecdotal evidence we’re receiving from those that supply retailers, companies like Cadbury Schweppes, Frito-Lay, and Kimberly-Clark.  The CEO of Kimberly-Clark reports that, again, demand is good on the demand side, but the cost front continues to worry them.  Regarding electronics, Texas Instruments is expecting a better second quarter than a first quarter.  In cell phones, the most significant price increases they have been able to pass through in several years are now being put into the marketplace. One ray of sunshine on the price front is in the health care sector.  According to Hewitt’s new reports—as you know, Mr. Chairman, this is the time of year in which they are negotiating the settlements for the price of health care to companies for next year—there has been a constant wrenching or ratcheting down of the increase in those prices, from 11.3 percent in ’05 to 8.2 percent in ’06, and they expect to go another percentage point downward this year. In summary, we, like the previous reporters, have a little dissonance with the Greenbook in terms of growth.  We don’t see as sharp a correction in the second quarter and looking forward. We are, however, concerned about inflation.  As you know, we look at the trimmed mean PCE deflator in Dallas—it has been running at a rate of about 2.4 percent.  But no matter how you measure it, inflation is running above 2 percent.  We’ve asked ourselves, and done some analysis, about where the inflation pressure is coming from.  The fraction of prices weighted by expenditure increasing at annual rates of zero to 3 percent has been squeezed, whereas the fraction of prices increasing at annual rates above 3 percent has grown.  Compared with December 2005, according to our analysis, Mr. Chairman, the fraction of price increases above 3 percent has risen from 33 percent to 57 percent.  The fraction with price increases above 2 percent has risen from 47 to 68 percent, and small price increases have become the exception. When you ask where the pressures are coming from—it’s a little like Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express.  They all did it.  All of these prices seem to be moving, and we do seem to be seeing, for the first time, a confirmation from our private-sector contacts that price expectations are rolling into pricing behavior. One last comment.  I spoke earlier and others have spoken about liquidity in the marketplace, and I reported about the desire of one utility to put together a $10 billion project that will entail 12 million manhours.  They raised $11 billion for the project.  The money is now in the bank, nonrecourse financing at 225 basis points over Libor.  Also, you may have seen that Anadarko is effecting a merger or, rather, an acquisition of two separate companies.  The CEO of Anadarko is on our Board.  He reported that they raised $22 billion “at breathtaking speed.”  Indeed, in both transactions, three houses chose to do the entire transaction in-house.  That is my report, Mr. Chairman.,   For health care?,   Well, actually we have that on our website, Mr. Chairman.  I’d be happy to give you the report.  These are the breakdowns of all the different expenditure components within the PCE.,   I’d be happy to provide that analysis."
"201";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While recent data show that Sixth District economic activity was solid in the early spring, anecdotal reports for May and June point to some definite deceleration.  The deceleration is particularly evident in housing, where an orderly slowing is now noted for the first time in areas outside Florida.  Reports from Florida, especially from the hotter markets, of significantly weak single family and multifamily sales have also continued during the intermeeting period.  It is especially noteworthy that both residential and nonresidential construction in hurricane-prone areas is now being severely affected by insurance problems. Underwriters are increasingly unwilling to write insurance, and those who will write it are asking for gigantic increases in premiums. Housing prices are not falling quite as much as the decline in sales and the rise in unsold inventories might suggest.  We are getting reports that builders are now making concessions and providing upgrades, such as marble countertops and other extras, and in one case even throwing in a free Mini Cooper to sweeten the deal [laughter] rather than reducing prices.  So real house prices may be declining more than the data suggest.  The insurance problems are affecting existing businesses as well.  We are getting reports that premiums for wind damage coverage are more than double, and in some areas we have heard reports of increases substantially larger than that. Some slowing is also evidenced in other areas besides housing.  Consumption appears to be less strong than it was in the early spring, with most of the recent deceleration in consumer spending appearing to be focused on lower-end retailers.  The most frequently heard explanation is the higher price of gasoline.  Manufacturing remains mixed, and for the first time in years, some building-supply producers outside hurricane areas are expecting business to slow in coming months. Price increases continue to be noted at the producer level, especially for construction materials, petroleum products, metals, and fuels—even with the decline in natural gas prices.  Firms are raising their final prices as much as they can, given the competitive environment, and fuel surcharges remain in place; but in short, this is more of the same on the price front. Redevelopment from last fall’s major hurricanes along our Gulf Coast region and in New Orleans continues to have important consequences for our region’s economy.  In the Lake Charles area of Louisiana, which is the westernmost part of the state, recovery is showing the usual patterns that we’ve seen after other hurricanes over the years.  Growth is now slightly above that of last year. Employment led by construction is up about 2 percent over levels a year ago.  Parts of the Mississippi coast are on a similar track.  The big shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, which suffered more than $1 billion in damages, is back in production and is now employing about 12,000 people, compared with 13,000 before the storm.  Other parts of the Mississippi coast are recovering more slowly because of a shortage of housing and the slowness in getting casinos back on line. Employment gains are dependent on the gaming industry, but it looks as though it will be late this year before most of the casinos will be able to reopen. New Orleans is still lagging.  The levees have been brought back to pre-Katrina status, but significant rebuilding has not yet begun, and most people who left have not yet returned.  The area did add 24,000 jobs from the low point, but this number pales in comparison with the 191,000 jobs that were lost between April 2005 and April 2006.  The area will continue to languish until the political and regulatory issues surrounding rebuilding are resolved and federal money begins to flow in significant amounts next year. Finally, with respect to energy, repair to the damaged Gulf Coast region drilling platforms, pipeline, and refineries has progressed, and the shut-in rates in May are now down to 20 percent for oil and about 10 percent for natural gas.  With the big Mars platform back fully on line, these shut-in figures should soon show additional improvement. Turning to the national economy, GDP growth has clearly slowed, but it is also beginning to exhibit increased volatility from quarter to quarter that is more characteristic of what we saw in the 1990s rather than the uncharacteristically steady quarter-to-quarter pattern of the past several years. The volatility makes extracting signals about the likely growth path from recent data more difficult, as reflected in the wide error bands around the near-term growth projections provided in the Greenbook.  My own forecast for growth in employment submitted for this meeting is slightly more optimistic than that in the Greenbook but is well within the forecast error bands. Of greater concern to me, however, is the inflation outlook.  Three issues related to inflation are particularly troublesome.  First, core inflation has been outside the range that many of us have publicly stated we would prefer, and some of us have been expressing increased concern about the more recent data.  Some of the work my staff has done in attempting to decompose signal from noise in these numbers implies that much of the recent rise in the three-month and six-month CPI that has gotten so much attention is noise.  But this implication in no way blunts the fact that even the signal component of inflation has been on an upward trend for a while and that the trend shows little sign of abating. Second, many have noted that the most recent jump in core CPI was driven by an increase in owners’ equivalent rent.  Again, work my staff has done decomposing the core CPI, looking back at the period of very low inflation as well as at the more recent period, clearly implies that the recent increase in owners’ equivalent rent should not have been a surprise because the number is driven by the fundamentals of demand for homeownership relative to rental demand.  With interest rates so low during the immediate post-recession period, we estimated that the preference shift for new homes relative to rental units accounted for almost half of the 1.6 percent decline that occurred in core CPI during the November 2001 to December 2003 period.  Since then, with a rise in our policy interest rate, housing demand has slowed, and demand for rental units has increased with commensurate increases in rents.  The point is that this movement in core CPI prices has a lot to do with our own policy shift.  Putting the proper measurement debate aside, this raises the difficult question of under what circumstances we should respond to cyclical price movements that are themselves temporary responses to previous policy rate increases. My third and last concern relates to our ability, or perhaps our willingness, in the near term or the medium term to engineer core inflation, however measured, down to the 1 percent to 2 percent range, and the risk that our continued adherence to that much-talked-about, very specific, and very tight objective without more explanation of how we plan to take such a range into account in our policy setting may soon paint us into a difficult policy corner.  But I’ll leave further thoughts on that to the policy discussion tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"202";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My view of the outlook has not changed significantly since the last meeting.  Generally speaking, I agree that, while we will have continued growth in GDP, we also will experience the beginning of a decline and below-trend growth probably through some of the remainder of this year and into 2007. Indeed, in my view, there are increasing signs that the combination of tighter monetary policy and higher energy costs is beginning to slow the economy’s momentum.  There are clear signals that housing has begun to weaken.  Moreover, the behavior of asset prices and risk premiums in financial markets suggests that credit costs have risen and market liquidity is at least beginning to see some pressure.  Also, it is worth noting that many other central banks are moving to a more-restrictive policy stance, suggesting that slower growth is the likely outcome for other countries as well as ours over the period ahead. As we discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy, I believe we must understand how our policy actions might affect the economy.  Oftentimes we do focus on the long end of the yield curve.  Certainly I do.  However, I believe it is also important to focus attention on the shorter side.  Longer-term rates continue to be unusually low.  Short-term rates have risen in lockstep with the fed funds rate.  Consequently, many consumers and many small businesses that have loans tied to prime have seen sharply higher rates over the past couple of years.  In response, consumers have scaled back their use of home equity loans fairly significantly over the past few months.  In addition, the repricing of low-rate adjustable loans continues to affect household discretionary spending, and it will begin to show up in pressure on small businesses. Evidence from the Tenth District is generally consistent with the national economic trends. Through May, District business activity continued to be strong, as others have said, especially in manufacturing and in energy, of course, for us.  Labor markets in much of our District remain tight. However, while businesses are experiencing strong cost pressures for materials and wages, they have, as far as we can see in some of our responses, been unable to really push higher prices as much as they would like.  As a result, some profit margins are under pressure, and our most recent manufacturing survey indicates that many firms have scaled back some of their capital spending plans from earlier projections.  As in the national economy, the District’s housing activity has begun to slow.  Housing permits have dropped sharply over the past several months, and the inventory of unsold homes has risen notably in many of the metro areas of our region. Turning to the inflation outlook, I find the recent pickup in core measures of inflation to be troubling.  However, I continue to think that much of the recent increase reflects long-past actions in monetary policy and some of the other resulting combinations of pass-through energy costs and the weaker dollar.  Consequently, although we are likely to see more months of elevated inflation readings, I believe that inflation will likely decline over the forecast period, assuming that we are holding at a firm—I should say a slightly firm—monetary policy.  Under these assumptions, I would expect core PCE inflation to decline from about 2.4 this year to 2.1 next year. The topic of inflation expectations has received considerable attention, but I see little evidence that expectations have changed significantly, at least so far.  Long-run survey measures of expected inflation remain anchored around 2½ percent for CPI.  Moreover, although the TIPS data suggest that inflation risk premiums are somewhat higher than they were earlier this year, these premiums do remain low by historical standards.  Thank you."
"203";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data have tended to confirm to a degree both the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to core inflation that we’ve been talking about at recent meetings.  Higher inflation interacting with policymaker comments on the inflation situation triggered higher expected real interest rates and more uncertainty about the longer-term future.  That in turn further tightened financial conditions, leading to more markdown of growth prospects.  Notably, the worry about added inflation pressures has not been confined to the United States, given strong growth abroad, high energy and commodity prices, and a sense that output is close to potential.  Widespread policy tightening and greater uncertainty have led to increased caution on the part of investors and tighter global financial conditions. The incoming data certainly have influenced my projections—I expect less growth and more inflation than I did a few months ago.  I’m also even less confident, if that’s possible, than I was given these surprises.  The key question in my mind is whether the conditions are in place or soon will be in place—that is, after tomorrow—to keep core inflation at considerably lower levels than it has been so far this year.  I think they are, and in this regard I’m a touch more optimistic than the staff.  I have slightly lower inflation for 2007 with the same policy assumption. Most important, I don’t believe that the extra inflation we’ve had results from the economy producing beyond its long-run potential.  We obviously can’t be very confident about this.  The decline in the unemployment rate to noticeably below 5 percent occurred only at the beginning of this year, but the behavior of compensation last year and this year suggests to me that the NAIRU is more likely to be under than to be over 5 percent.  Perhaps better job- matching through Internet search, declining real minimum wages, and lingering worker insecurity, after the only-moderate increase in employment early in this expansion, have lowered the NAIRU a touch.  We should expect compensation growth to pick up as in the staff forecast, but the implications of this pickup for inflation are unclear, given elevated profit margins and what is likely to be a competitive business environment. I do think relative price adjustments are playing an important role in what we’ve been seeing.  I suspect I have been implicitly underestimating the effect of higher energy prices on both output and inflation.  Before this year, the effect of rising energy prices on inflation was offset by slack in the economy, and the effect on activity was offset by easing monetary policy that was put in place to counter that slack.  With both slack and easing policy disappearing, the effects of higher energy prices are showing through in both output and inflation. Another adverse price shock seems to be coming from the housing market, where the previous run-up in prices and the higher interest rates are weakening prospects for home price appreciation.  This weakening, in turn, is both reducing activity and raising actual and imputed owners’ equivalent rents.  The longer-term inflation effects of both these relative price changes will depend on their persistence and their propagation into other prices. In this regard, President Poole, I see us as perhaps accommodating the first-round effects of the increase in prices but making sure they don’t propagate beyond that, rather than having a price-level target that would bring us back down to the old price level.  With regard to persistence, petroleum prices have leveled out since April, and futures markets don’t suggest further increases.  It’s difficult to get much of a fix on future rent increases, as prices and rents realign to higher interest rates and lower expected capital gains.  In the past, most of that realignment has come through prices; but we don’t have many observations, and the required adjustment appears much larger this time. There are two keys to preventing the relative price changes from becoming embedded in broader and more persistent inflation:  low inflation expectations and a competitive business environment.  If energy prices do flatten out, headline inflation will come down, and I think that will help to contain the inflation expectations of households and businesses and bring down core inflation. The propagation of higher rates of increase in rents, should they persist, to other prices I found much harder to analyze.  After all, homeowners are, in effect, paying themselves higher imputed prices, and it’s not clear that they would change their behavior in labor markets to expect higher wages as a result.  Moreover, with respect to owners’ equivalent rent, I think our usual financial market measures of inflation expectations may not be reliable indicators of behavioral shifts.  Expected persistent increases in owners’ equivalent rent will boost expected CPI showing up in TIPS spreads but not necessarily affecting other pricing decisions.  A persistence of elevated rent increases will put a premium on viewing their implications for future inflation rather than on simply reacting to the incoming data. The competitive environment will depend largely on the degree of resource utilization. In this regard, the negative effects of the oil and housing market developments on activity, along with the tightening in financial conditions, suggest that activity could well run at least a little below the rate of growth of potential for the next several quarters.  That will help to limit longer-run inflation pressures.  In a sense, the forces that seem to be pushing up inflation are also contributing to the conditions that should hold it in check. In sum, recent inflation data have been an unpleasant surprise, but the source of the price increases—that is, price shocks, not overshooting—and the economic conditions coming into place should imply a softening of core inflation over the next 1½ years.  This outcome is based on the assumption that the relative price increases don’t become more broadly embedded in other prices and second-round effects.  We’ll talk tomorrow about how policy might contribute to reducing the odds of that possibility.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"204";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the last meeting I believe Dave Stockton, when he was describing the outlook, said that he was a bit schizophrenic about it. Given the comments of President Moskow, it is clear that he is no longer schizophrenic but that one side has taken over—the dark side.  [Laughter]   That does not seem to reflect exactly where everyone is, but I think the issues that have been brought out in the Greenbook are extremely important to consider.  I, too, have knocked down my growth estimates a bit, although not quite as much as the Greenbook; and I, too, as many people have said, share a concern that some of the numbers coming in on both headline and core inflation are a bit higher than I had hoped, although I think they are still not out of a manageable range. Obviously, payroll employment growth is a bit less robust than in the previous forecast. Since that forecast, we’ve had a little more cooling in housing and some softening of retail demand.  I take a slightly different view of the high tax receipts that have been pouring into the Treasury because they are not only corporate tax receipts but also individual tax receipts.  In some sense that’s putting a bit of a drag on real disposable income because people seem to be paying a little more in taxes and, at the same time, labor costs and pay have not been going up. So taxes are potentially a bit of a drag, and the Administration seems able to pursue a tighter expenditure policy this year than it has in the past, so we won’t be getting as much of a boost on the fiscal side as we have had. A number of bright spots have been mentioned here, particularly related to business fixed investment, durable goods orders, and business confidence.  But what are some of the key risks that we have before us?  Obviously, housing has been discussed in great detail, and so I won’t go through it in more detail.  I noted, as Governor Bies did, the importance of cancellations in suggesting a change in the way people are dealing with these markets.  If cancellations go up significantly, then a lot more housing stock that is searching for a buyer could be left on the market.  Anecdotally, I’ve heard the same kinds of things that President Guynn mentioned, that the equivalent of the toaster is perhaps being given out.  Such incentives are not showing up in the reported housing price, but other adjustments are. I’m not quite as optimistic about world economic growth as the forecast is.  I think a lot of uncertainties exist there.  We have seen and are seeing a lot of elections, particularly in emerging markets.  Mexico obviously has one coming up very soon, which could have a significant effect on a very important trading partner of the United States.  Also, as a number of people have mentioned, we’re seeing a lot of policy tightening around the world.  The obvious question is whether the central banks outside the United States are behind the curve or ahead of the curve.  Well, wherever they are, they are moving along a curve, and they seem to be moving more aggressively than they have in the past.  I think the tightening is going to have more of an effect than has been embedded in a number of the forecasts, not only here but also at the IMF. Another concern that I have relates to something that President Pianalto mentioned—a disconnect between the numbers that we’re seeing on consumption and business optimism about investment.  My concern is about what’s going to be happening to demand for their products down the line.  It’s certainly disconcerting to hear that one of the largest private institutions in the world—Wal-Mart—is missing its growth targets fairly significantly.  They are a very important part of retail sales.  One could even say that they effectively know what retail sales are before the numbers are reported because their sales are so highly correlated with overall retail sales.  So my concern is that we’re having the economy do the right sort of thing by moving more toward business investment and a little away from consumption, but if we move too much away from consumption, the demand won’t be there to make the investment pay off.  We saw a bit of this in the late 1990s as we moved much more in the investment direction, but the investment turned out not to have the kinds of returns that people were expecting.  Now we’re in a very fortunate situation because, even if those returns decline dramatically, a lot of profitability is out there, as Governor Warsh said.  So profits could drop quite significantly, but we’re not going to see a real problem in the corporate sector, as we might have in other circumstances.  I don’t want to overemphasize this concern, but to me it’s a bit of a puzzle, and I see it definitely as a risk. Turning to the inflation outlook, people have mentioned both here and publicly a cavalcade of concerns about the upticks in PCE and CPI core numbers, which have helped in turn to reduce inflation expectations.  Term premiums continue to remain low, and forward rates continue to remain low.  Often inflation seems to have a bit of momentum—it continues to move up or stays elevated—even as the economy begins to slow a bit.  We have to be careful in deciphering what will continue to move up and what is just inflation that is lagging a bit as the economy slows.  We have seen a dramatic change in commodity prices since our last meeting. Basically, within a few days of the meeting on May 10, almost all the major commodities, whether copper, gold, or whichever one you want, came to a peak.  Since then, oil has come down a little, although not all that much.  I think it’s heartening for the inflation outlook going forward that those elevated levels didn’t stay that elevated.  Although those commodity prices are much higher in 2006 than they had been previously, oil prices have not increased that much during 2006. So what’s going to happen to core inflation going forward?  I think the excellent presentation that we had, in particular the discussion of the attempts to see how well we are modeling historical inflation and inflation going forward, shows that we have a long way to go and that we don’t really understand those dynamics very well.  I share Governor Kohn’s intuition, for the reasons that he articulated, that core inflation going forward will soften a bit more than the Greenbook projects.  I’m not going to repeat those reasons; but as Governor Kohn said, there’s a lot of uncertainty about them, and we don’t understand all that much. Ultimately, as a number of people have mentioned, it comes down a lot to the type of statements that we make, the credibility that we have.  That’s true not only here but around the world, where we are seeing inflation rates and expected inflation rates come down quite a bit. That’s something that ultimately we control very directly.  In today’s circumstances, when inflation is not really out of control but is moving up a little, being very clear about what our concerns are can have benefits in bringing down expectations and perhaps changing the inflation dynamic.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"205";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic growth in the Fifth District eased off the throttle a bit since our last meeting.  Our June manufacturing survey released yesterday morning continued to show nearly flat activity.  Indexes for shipments and new orders were barely positive, essentially unchanged from May, and down from strong readings for March and April.  The service sector, on the other hand, continues to display solid growth, with overall services revenues right on their three-month average and retail sales rebounding after a dip in May.  However, our big-ticket index, which is dominated by car sales, remained weak.  Employment indexes for both services and manufacturing were positive in June, with a slight decline in the services sector but a substantial gain in manufacturing.  District housing markets remained reasonably strong.  Sales and construction activity have continued to slip from last year’s levels in many areas, but our contacts do not seem surprised or panicked, and we continue to get reports of a pickup in commercial construction activity.  Price pressures remain elevated in the Fifth District, and expectations for manufacturing price trends during the next six months remain about where they have been since last fall, roughly 3 percent for prices paid and 2 percent for prices received.  In the services sector, expected price increases for the next six months exceeded 3½ percent for the second month in a row, setting a new record high for this twelve-year-old index. Turning to the national economy, the Greenbook presents, as President Moskow noted, a distinctly different picture from six weeks ago, perhaps most notably with regard to consumer spending.  Lower growth of household income since the middle of last year has led the staff to reduce its estimate of the level of real disposable income this quarter 1 percent, and they have reduced their estimate of consumption this quarter 0.4 percent.  The Greenbook also marks down consumption growth ½ percent in the second half of ’06 and ¼ percent in ’07. Now, it is certainly reasonable to expect lower current income to affect current consumption expenditures, but I am inclined to revise my outlook for consumption growth by less than the Greenbook.  Growth in real disposable income is forecast to bounce back in the second half.  So the first-half decline looks more like a permanent reduction in the level of income than a permanent reduction in the growth rate of income.  I would have expected a corresponding effect on the path of consumption, a one-time reduction in the level, with less of a reduction in forecast growth rates. The same reasoning for me applies to the downward revision that has been made to current household wealth. This quibble aside, the outlook for the real side of the economy is softer than at the time of our last meeting, but it still strikes me as broadly consistent with sustained growth fluctuating around a trend near 3 percent.  True, housing market activity has fallen more rapidly since the last meeting than many, including the Greenbook authors, had expected, but the rate of decline has not fallen outside a range that at the beginning of the year would have seemed plausible.  While the recent weaker-than-expected employment reports suggest slower job growth going forward, the Greenbook employment forecast seems reasonably well aligned with demographic and labor force participation trends.  So on the whole, I would say that, despite the recent evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information, the real side of the forecast does not seem out of the ordinary or terribly unsatisfactory to me. The inflation picture, on the other hand, does stand out and demand some attention.  We have just seen our worst three-month performance on the core CPI in more than eleven years, 3.8 percent, and the core PCE numbers are likely to be equally unfavorable.  I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that special factors, such as owners’ equivalent rent, do not excuse recent CPI behavior.  Fortunately for us, inflation expectations have declined recently.  The survey measures and TIPS spreads have moderated somewhat since our last meeting.  Still, inflation expectations appear to be fluctuating around a level suggesting PCE inflation above 2 percent. Moreover, the Greenbook forecast now has year-over-year core PCE inflation remaining at 2.2 percent throughout the forecast period.  To me this forecast is unacceptable. To forecast a bulge to 2½ percent followed by a return to below 2 percent, as the Greenbook used to earlier this year, is one thing, but a plan for core inflation of more than 2 percent a year and a half from now is another thing entirely.  Surely in an eighteen-month period we can improve that outcome, but I will leave until tomorrow a discussion of our policy options.  For now I just want to note that recent events provide some striking evidence that I think is likely to have an important bearing on our strategy in the near term. Leading up to our last meeting, there were several instances in which markets had responded to incoming news by marking up expected inflation and marking down the expected policy path, which I took as evidence of instability in market participants’ views about our intentions regarding inflation.  Similar instability was evident in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina as well. Since the last meeting, increases in the expected policy path have coincided with communications by the Committee via statements, minutes, speeches, and interviews.  This was documented in this week’s Board briefings. The same appears to be true of reductions in expected inflation, I think.  I take this recent history as evidence that expectations regarding inflation and the conduct of monetary policy are to a significant extent forward-looking and can be influenced by our communications.  As I pointed out earlier this year, the extent to which expectations are viewed as forward-looking or backward-looking could well influence the desirability of various policy options, especially how ambitious one wants to be about bringing inflation back in line.  I also take the recent history as suggesting the importance of clarifying the public’s understanding of how we intend to conduct policy, even if we cannot provide definitive advance guidance about the numerical value of future policy rate settings.  Thank you.,   Bill, this isn’t the way people have been using “pass-through” around here.  I’ve taken “pass-through” to mean an increase in the overall core rate, and I think that’s the way everyone else has used it.  So the scenario you describe wouldn’t result in any pass-through, the way for example President Yellen used the term.  Am I right?,   I understand that, Bill."
"206";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, uncertainty about the outlook for both growth and inflation has increased.  Clearly the inflation data are disappointing, but let me first focus on economic growth.  Here the key question is how much of the second-quarter weakness is transitory and how much represents a more fundamental softening in activity.  So with regard to the consumer, we share the Greenbook’s assessment that increases in consumer expenditures will recover somewhere close to a rate of 3 percent in the second half of this year. Qualitatively, this seems to be the assessment of our contacts as well.  One, a major builder and operator of shopping malls throughout the United States, said that retailers at malls have been quite pleased with the first five months of the year.  Although they are expecting slower growth in the second half, they did not think that the falloff would be very large.  The automakers report that June sales are relatively soft but better than in May, and they kept their forecast for light vehicles for the year as a whole around 16.6 million or 16.7 million units, which means they expect the second half of the year to be similar to the first half.  This was also the consensus of the twenty-four industry analysts at our annual Automotive Outlook Symposium that we held last month. Looking at the fundamentals, like the Greenbook we think that growth in real income will be adequate to support the projected pace of spending.  Under the baseline path for oil prices, energy prices should turn from a negative to a neutral factor for real income growth, though this is certainly an area of great uncertainty.  Also, tight labor markets should eventually generate somewhat larger increases in wages, which should help offset the effects on overall income growth of somewhat slower gains in employment.  Here I should note that we do not think that the recent slowdown in job growth is the start of a deterioration in the labor market.  Our contact at Manpower studied this issue recently in response to skeptical Wall Street analysts who thought that the labor market was softening and that this would be reflected in a weakening temp sector.  He studied forty major markets and found no signs of cutbacks in hiring plans by his customers, and his business continues to grow at a modest pace.  Given our view of the trends in participation rates and other factors, we think that the 100,000 per month gains in payroll employment that we have seen over the past couple of months are consistent with an economy growing near potential, hence with little change in labor market slack. Of course, housing markets are weakening.  At the last meeting we were more pessimistic than the Greenbook.  This time, with its large revision, the Greenbook is slightly more pessimistic than we are.  However, the overall negative tone of the Greenbook seems a bit puzzling to me given the current conditions that we were discussing earlier.  After all, mortgage rates are not that high. The rate of house-price appreciation has not come down more than we expected.  Still, current conditions are softening.  A contact from a major national builder, Pulte Homes, told us that their new orders had dropped sharply and that the current high level of construction is being supported by working off backlogs.  Accordingly, he expected a more marked slowdown in building in 2007. In the business sector, the reports from the manufacturers outside autos were, in general, very upbeat.  Most indicated that orders and backlogs for investment goods were quite high.  One of my directors, who is from a large, diversified manufacturing firm and who has always been cautious about future capital spending, said that demand for long-lead-time capital goods now is as strong as he has seen in his thirty years in business.  And the pickup in nonresidential construction is partially offsetting the weaker activity on the residential side. Finally, financial conditions continue to be favorable.  Indeed, given the recent increases in inflation, real short-term interest rates are in the middle of the neutral range, as shown in the Bluebook.  Long-term borrowing costs are relatively low, and we still hear that there’s a lot of liquidity flowing through the financial system.  So we think the outlook for business investment looks solid and somewhat stronger over the course of ’06 than the Greenbook forecast. To summarize our outlook for real activity, we think that the economy has somewhat stronger underlying momentum than the Greenbook does, and we are looking for growth at a pace of around 3 percent in the second half of this year. With regard to inflationary pressures, many of our contacts expressed concerns about input costs.  We heard numerous reports this round of manufacturers that were passing on material cost increases to their customers.  In the Chicago Purchasing Managers Survey, which will be released this Friday, the prices-paid component shot up from 76.9 in May to 89.0 in June, and the overall index moved down from 61.5 to 56.5. Capacity constraints also appear to be more common.  For example, given industry consolidation, airline load factors are very high, and one major carrier indicated that it had been able to increase prices more than enough to cover higher fuel costs.  We also received some reports that shortages of skilled labor were holding back production.  Still, there were few signs of accelerating wage pressures. Of course, the incoming data on consumer prices have been disappointing, as Jeff Lacker just said, and as a result our indicator model’s forecasts of core PCE inflation in ’06 were revised up about 0.3 percentage point, to between 2.4 and 2.6 percent.  The higher projection is from the model estimated using data since 1967; the lower number is from the estimates using data only since 1984. We think inflation this year will come in closer to the 2.4 percent figure as some of the cost pass- through that has already boosted prices runs its course. Looking to ’07, the model’s projections rose a tenth or two from the previous forecasts.  The prediction using the post-1984 sample is 2.1 percent, whereas the long sample projection is 2.6 percent.  So in the absence of some good news on the energy or materials costs front, I do not think that inflation will be headed into the bottom half of that range unless growth next year comes in a good deal below potential.  At 3 percent, my forecast for GDP growth in ’07 is a bit below potential.  My forecast for PCE inflation is 2.3 percent.  This outlook is conditioned on my view of appropriate policy, which is a slightly higher path for the funds rate than currently built into the Greenbook because I feel that 2.4 percent inflation is too high, so I assumed that appropriate policy should attempt to arrest this acceleration.,   Well, it’s brutal compared with last year at this time because they had an employee-incentive pricing program last year, which they’re not going to have this year.  It’s an interesting situation because they say that Chrysler has announced that they’re going to have some higher incentives.  I spoke to the CEO of General Motors.  He claims that they’re trying to hold the line on these incentives and keep them below the very high level they’ve had these past few years; they are not going to cut prices as they have in previous years.  We’ll see whether they’re able to do this, but that’s their stated position now"
"207";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me outline a few comments from my business contacts first.  Wal-Mart—and Richard talked about that a bit—has a substantial piece of its business, but by no means all of it, with lower-income consumers.  They are coming in several hundred basis points below plan since Easter, and that’s for the entire business.  That’s a pretty substantial hit for the world’s largest retailer—of course, that’s mostly U.S. business. There is a pronounced paycheck cycle.  An example that my contact gave me was that right after receiving paychecks, which generally come at the end of the month and the middle of the month, consumers are buying large economy-size packages of stuff that comes that way.  As they go through the month, up to the next paycheck, they are buying increasingly smaller quantities. They’re just running out of liquidity until the next paycheck comes.  Wal-Mart still has many applicants for every job.  On average, when they are expanding, they have ten applicants for every job. My contact at J.B. Hunt said that he had the general perception that the economy is slowing.  Hunt and, I think, many other truck companies have not been expanding their fleets.  In fact, Hunt has cut back its truck fleet because of the shortage of drivers.  My contact said that there’s a dire—that was his word—shortage of drivers; the shortage is worse than he has ever seen it.  But—and I think this is interesting—Hunt is not responding with wage increases beyond the normal 3 to 4 percent a year.  I talked to my contact about that, and he said they are just not ready to raise wages.  What they do is to manage their business by telling people that “the truck capacity is not available; go someplace else.”  Some of that is trying to push customers into higher-cost deliveries at Hunt, and the customers may go that way or may just go someplace else. The Greenbook discussed the large truck issue with the new truck engine requirements. That’s going to produce a very large cycle in large trucks.  I guess that the companies producing those large trucks and engines are fully occupied this year, and then there’s going to be a slack period. My FedEx contact said that he does not see weakness in any part of the business except domestic express.  What’s happening there is that, because of the high fuel surcharges and the improved ground service, quite a number of customers are shifting from express air, which is much more expensive, to ground.  He said that they do have some pressure regarding IT and accounting professionals.  Salaries in those areas are rising perhaps 15 percent above last year. My UPS contact talked mostly about a tentative agreement with its pilots union.  (This is not yet public information; I think it will be released later this week.)  The characteristics of the agreement are quite interesting.  I may not have all the details quite correct, but one of the things that astonished me is that the agreement, if ratified by the membership, runs to 12/31/2011—a labor contract that extends to 2011!   There’s an upfront 17.7 percent pay increase, but it reflects the fact that there have been no increases since the previous contact expired in 2003, so there’s a makeup there.  But the percentage increases thereafter to me are quite low, and it’s interesting that they were able to get the pilots to sign on.  After eighteen months, 3 percent, and then every twelve months thereafter, 3.25, 3.25, 3.25, 3.50—that may not all add up to 2011, but I was writing as fast as I could—but that’s the general pattern, 3.25 to 3.5 percent stretched out over coming years.  They bargained hard, and UPS was able to have a contract with no cost-of-living adjustment in it, which I think is significant in terms of inflation expectations.  There were some other allowances having to do with work rules, some per diem allowances, pensions, and so forth.  So the total costs are a bit higher than the 3.25, 3.5 percent would indicate, but that is the basic pattern.  There is also a signing bonus when the contract is ratified.  A captain will get $60,000 for signing on the dotted line that ratifies the contract, a first officer will get $40,000, and a second officer will get $34,000.  Those bonuses, I believe, will not show up in the ECI, given the way the ECI is put together.  So I think we want to keep our eyes out for wage agreements that have things in them that escape the ECI.  I expect FedEx to follow pretty quickly. Now I want to make a couple of general comments.  The Greenbook certainly has a pretty strong business capital spending projection.  My view is that, in recent years, companies have had rather contained or constrained capital expenditures, and firms worked hard to be disciplined in cost control to make sure they didn’t expand capacity until they really needed it. Of course, corporate profits have done very well.  But now many companies have very little excess capacity, and they are putting in place more capacity.  My FedEx contact said that FedEx is increasing its capital expenditures this year, and 75 percent of the spending is for capacity expansion.  In recent years, a much larger fraction was for productivity improvement rather than capacity expansion.  So I think that this expansion of capacity reflects business optimism about the long run.  Most of these plans have a very long period connected with them.  Even though some of the expansion involves items, like computers, that are purchased off the shelf, these items are part of a much longer term plan.  I don’t think this part of the economy is vulnerable to a quick turnaround. The slower growth in consumption likely reflects the pressures on lower-income consumers, and we have limited spending capacity, perhaps for many consumers, because the saving rate is already so low.  So maybe what we’re seeing is the long-awaited and long-desired shift in the composition of GDP toward more business investment and less consumption, and that change in mix would be very healthy.  Yet to come would be any evidence of a change toward higher net exports, but this would be a change in composition with less consumption, less housing, and more business investment. There’s been a lot of discussion about energy pass-through.  I’m going to make an assertion that’s probably a little too bold, but I think it’s basically correct:  If energy prices stay where they are, in the long run full pass-through must occur.  Companies can’t absorb energy costs forever.  Full pass-through must occur, and the pass-through occurs in several ways.  One way, as with the UPS and FedEx surcharges, is that they just put those into the business.  They just are not going to absorb those.  Other types of pass-through occur through companies’ substituting energy-saving technology—for example, to reduce energy intensity—but such technologies don’t come free.  So they’re going to have to include the costs of those substitutions in what they do.  Then we can have changes in the mix of goods that are produced and consumed, such as the change in the mix away from express air toward ground service.  But the energy pass-through has to be complete in the long run.  If we’re going to avoid a long-run effect on the price level, higher energy prices must be offset by lower prices elsewhere, so that this becomes a change in relative prices without an effect on the aggregate price level.  I just wanted to make that comment because it looks to me as though we’re in a situation in which oil is expected to remain around $70 a barrel for an indefinite future and those adjustments are going to be taking place continuously.  So we ought to work under the assumption that there’s going to be complete pass-through.,   Part of what we’ve been doing is looking at individual cases.  Until recently, for example, the passenger airlines were unable to pass through fuel increases, whereas the UPSes and FedExes of the world were able to pass them through.  But eventually, the passenger airlines have to pass through because they’re unprofitable if they don’t.  The price increases have to pass through.,   We’ve been using the term as a way of understanding some of the underlying pricing power that firms have.  Firms do absorb cost increases in the short run, but they can’t absorb them in the long run.  So what has to happen is that the secondary effects will show up in the level of core unless we put downward pressure on the non-energy-related parts, so that this ends up being a relative price change and not a change in the aggregate price level. That’s the point I’m trying to make."
"208";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I continue to think the outlook for the national economy is reasonably positive.  As best I can judge, housing activity is slowing largely as expected.  The pace of increases of home prices is decelerating.  Prices may be declining in some markets, but surely if we had put confidence intervals around our earlier forecasts of housing activity and of price behavior, what we are currently observing would have fallen within those intervals.  Other components of aggregate demand look reasonably well maintained to me.  In this regard, comments from our directors and from others with whom I have talked indicate that, except for the agricultural sector, persistently high energy prices are having at most a modest negative effect on business activity.  Moreover, and equally important in my mind, the respective paths of productivity and of aggregate hours suggest to me that the economy should continue to expand at a respectable pace going forward.  To sum up, my forecast of real activity is for slightly more growth than the Greenbook this year, and there is a wider positive divergence between my forecast and the Greenbook forecast for 2007. In this regard, I have tended at these meetings to emphasize the underlying resilience and flexibility of the economy.  I still have a lot of confidence in those characteristics, and I think they augur well for the longer-run performance of the economy.  But I have been asking myself whether I am too sanguine about this.  Is there more to the second-quarter slowing in growth or to persistently high energy prices or to the housing situation—is there more to be concerned about than my previous statements might suggest? My tentative answer to that question is that I think we should not be overly concerned at the moment about the economic outlook in terms of growth for several reasons.  As I already suggested, the effects of persistently high energy prices, although not trivial, do not appear to be devastating either.  Furthermore, the financial system remains sound and flexible.  Interest rates for the most part are still relatively favorable, and those factors should help to sustain demand both from households and from business.  I think it is worth recalling that situation at this point; certainly bankers report, at least typically, fierce competition for customers in the current environment. Finally, the low levels of initial claims for unemployment insurance as well as anecdotes, from our District at least, suggest continued expansion in employment. On the price front, however, current circumstances and the outlook do not now appear to me to be favorable.  Earlier I had thought that the acceleration in core inflation that we were observing was likely to be similar to the experience in early 2004, when we had an acceleration but it was relatively quickly reversed.  But a quick reversal doesn’t look all that likely to me at the moment for several reasons.  First of all, as people have already commented, the recent surprises have been on the upside, and in light of that, I have to conclude that there is a bit more underlying momentum to inflation than I earlier thought.  I have the sense that other central banks around the world are seeing and responding to the same thing.  If this assessment is correct and there is more inflationary momentum, then the bulk of the analytical work that has been done seems to suggest rather strongly that arresting that momentum or reversing it is not going to be easy in the short run. Inflationary expectations apparently have not deteriorated recently, and here I am referring to the past couple of years, but I am not sure I would make the same statement with regard to the path of inflationary expectations relative to the earlier years of this decade.  Overall, I have the impression that, on the margin, a little more inflation is both characterizing the economy and being accepted by households and by businesses."
"209";"MR. STONE.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Third District is also moderating in the second quarter.  Our pattern is similar to that of the nation, but the District had less acceleration in the first quarter and less deceleration in the second quarter. Payroll employment growth in our three states is slowing.  The unemployment rate has edged up slightly over the past several months, but the unemployment rate in most of the District’s labor markets is still lower than a year ago.  Our business contacts still report some difficulty in filling open positions, and a quarter of the respondents to a special question in our Business Outlook Survey of Manufacturers say that the increases in wage rates needed to attract new hires this year are higher than they were last year. Regional manufacturing activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, but the indexes for new orders and shipments were up noticeably after a one-month slump in May.  Despite this improvement, our manufacturers’ expectations about future activity have deteriorated.  While they still plan to add to payrolls and expand capacity over the next six months, they have moderated these plans since the beginning of the year. At the last meeting, I reported that, in contrast to other Districts, retailers in our region did not express much concern that higher gasoline prices would eat into their sales; that view has changed.  Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what I reported at our last meeting. Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen, but the acceleration doesn’t appear to be as strong as elsewhere in the nation.  In contrast, residential construction in our three states has been flat this year, and home sales are down.  Thus far the slowing in our region looks to be an orderly process. Unfortunately, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region appear to be increasing at a faster pace than those in the nation as a whole, primarily because of a larger increase in housing costs in the Philadelphia metropolitan area than in the nation.  In addition, our manufacturers report that industrial price pressures have increased in recent months.  Fortunately, we do not see a similar acceleration in labor costs, although the increases we are seeing in the Northeast are somewhat higher than in other parts in the country. In summary, current conditions and the outlook in our region continue to be positive, but the rate of expansion is expected to be somewhat more modest than we’ve seen over the past year. Price pressures continue to be a concern in our region. Turning to the national front, I would characterize the outlook in a similar way.  Our growth forecast is similar to the Greenbook’s for 2006.  We expect a significant slowing in activity in the second quarter followed by a pickup during the second half of the year to a pace that is slightly below potential.  The slowdown in housing and high gasoline prices contribute to a slowdown in consumer spending, and the lagged effects of rising short-term interest rates and higher oil prices keep real growth slightly below potential. Our forecast for 2007 differs somewhat from the Greenbook.  We see growth in 2007 slightly below that in 2006, whereas the Greenbook sees growth slowing appreciably.  In our view, there has been more underlying strength in the economy.  For example, we attribute more of the second-quarter slowdown to temporary factors.  We are more optimistic than the Greenbook about employment growth.  We see nonfarm payroll growth averaging a good deal more than the Greenbook forecast.  We see unemployment rising to 5.1 percent by the fourth quarter of next year. Our inflation outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook’s partly because we see less slowing of aggregate demand.  We do not see core PCE inflation decelerating next year.  We think the economy has been operating and will continue to operate slightly beyond full employment over the next several quarters and that foreign price competition will ease as the dollar depreciates.  So despite our view that the indirect effects of the sharp rise in energy prices will wane in 2007, we expect core inflation not to decelerate.  We do see some deceleration in 2008, but that is because we built in a slightly higher path for interest rates than that in the Greenbook forecast. Of course, there are risks to the forecast.  Most of them have been mentioned; but in our view, the risks to growth, even at our higher level of growth, are roughly balanced.  In contrast, the inflation risks are slightly to the upside.  As people have noted, core inflation has accelerated in recent months, and it is above the range I consider consistent with price stability.  Should aggregate demand moderate less than expected, there is a risk that strong inflation pressures could emerge.  At this point, I believe that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored, and our forecast is predicated on monetary policy ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise longer-term expectations. This is likely my last meeting, but for sure I’ll be watching carefully as we go forward.  I have confidence that the Committee, along with the new Philadelphia president, will do a good job to make sure that inflation expectations remain anchored.  I’d like to thank the Chairman, the participants, and the rest of this staff for how well you have treated me over the past three meetings. I have to remember that I made the statement in June 2000 that it would be my last meeting, so I say “in the foreseeable future” [laughter] it will be my last meeting.  Thank you very much."
"210";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In terms of my overall comments, I consider my views really in the center of gravity, as the Vice Chairman described it, of the speakers around the table and probably, again, quite a bit more optimistic in terms of GDP growth and perhaps also more concerned about inflation risks than the Greenbook. When I look at the strength of the fundamentals of the economy, including strong and accelerating profits, low unemployment, highly accessible capital markets, and remarkably strong balance sheets both for consumers and businesses, I find it hard to reconcile those with some of the pessimism coming not just from the Greenbook but also from some economists that the markets follow.  The two trends and the two sets of data seem to be going in very different directions. Regarding the data that have come in since our last FOMC meeting, some time has been spent here on a few of the negative surprises, so I want to highlight a few of the positive bits of news.  Federal tax receipts in May were up 26 percent from May a year ago.  For the past twelve months, as we’ve talked about before, total tax receipts into the government went up 12.9 percent.  Core retail sales rose 0.4 percent in May, up about 6.9 percent year over year if we exclude some of the more volatile items.  According to surveys and anecdotes, the manufacturing base continues to be remarkably robust, both in terms of growth and in terms of jobs.  I’d also note that durable goods orders, though not incredibly robust over the past month, represent growth of about 10 percent over the past three months if we exclude aircraft and look only at nondefense capital goods.  So all in all, I think that the data suggest a more positive trend. What I’d like to do is spend a little time talking about how the markets have reacted to this news and build on a couple of the points that Dino made at the outset.  First, a lot of pundits have described the “new volatility” in the marketplace, and I think that Dino made a very compelling case that the volatility has really not been nearly as severe as the commentators suggest.  Volatility has in some ways been a euphemism for the fact that the markets have been down, and those are obviously quite different things.  [Laughter] I think another bit of conventional wisdom is influencing decisionmakers, both in Washington and in business, and it is probably important to correct.  That idea is that somehow the Fed has been the cause of this market volatility.  I think that is largely incorrect.  When I look at what has happened, I think that the markets are focused more and more on core economic fundamentals.  We have changed in the perspective of the markets, which used to think some months and quarters ago that bad news meant good news and now they think that bad news is actually bad news.  The bad news previously meant that we weren’t going to be moving rates higher.  Again, I think the markets, not the commentators, have a better understanding that they really need to be focusing on economic fundamentals. When I look at the economic fundamentals, one of the data points that I look to is the state of corporate profit growth at this point in the cycle.  Over the past twelve months, it was 13.6 percent, and if we look at bottom-up analyst forward estimates for the S&P 500 or for the Russell, it appears that those analyst estimates are actually accelerating.  As a former banker, I will admit to some bias in these numbers, but they’ve been tracking reasonably well.  The forward estimates are that corporate profits should be up something like 16 percent.  So one of the things that we can do over the next several meetings is see how actual results track against those expectations, and my bet is that there will not be as much disappointment in those numbers as the top-down macroeconomic views would suggest. Diving down into some of the individual markets, I suggest that they’re telling us different things about the state of the economy and the state of inflation prospects.  First, the equity markets have been off on the order of 7 or 8 percent, and many people, myself included, would have thought that that would have significantly affected CEO confidence, that it would have changed some perspectives about where they are in the capital expenditure cycle.  I think that probably has happened in the IPO market.  The IPO market has gotten slower and more selective, and issues that can come to market now have been at the top end of what’s in the pipeline.  If we look more broadly, however, beyond what’s going on in the equity markets, if we look at the cap-ex market, capital expenditures appear to be above plan generally from the discussions I’ve had with folks who are on boards of different companies. One CEO called before coming out with a survey of CEO expectations for growth in capital expenditures, and he exclaimed, “What are you guys seeing that we’re not?”  In some way he was checking to try to understand what the reason was for concern when his company surveys continue to be quite positive.  The only caution I have is that, if you look across a breadth of CEO surveys on growth, the survey numbers have, in fact, come down from, let’s say, April to June.  But, again, my sense of the matter is that CEOs are scratching their own heads at this very moment that we’re having a discussion about the economy in transition.  The messages that come from the Fed and from other policymakers over the next month, including in the Chairman’s monetary policy testimony, will be very important to set the tone, because CEOs are not sure whether to continue to hit the accelerator or whether this might be a time in their own businesses for a pause in capital expenditures. I have a few comments on a couple of other markets.  Normally in a time like this, when the equity markets are off 7, 8, or 9 percent, the merger and acquisition markets, which I view as a pretty good proxy for CEO confidence, would stop.  In fact, that hasn’t happened:  M&A pipelines are more robust than ever.  The unthinkable deals are being printed and being published.  Pipelines are terrifically strong, and CEOs are ready in some ways to “bet the company” on the strength of their convictions—another reason that I have confidence that business growth could well be in excess of the Greenbook estimates. Let me make two or three other comments.  First, in terms of inflation, as I look at the commodity markets and at the TIPS markets, I’m most comforted not so much by relative moves, because those TIPS markets are certainly not perfect in describing inflation expectations, but by the responsiveness of those markets to remarks that have come from folks around this table.  That is, if we think about what our authority is in influencing inflation expectations, the very real-time changes in the TIPS markets give me comfort that at this point in the cycle we will be able, with proper and appropriate policies that we’ll discuss tomorrow, to change those inflation expectations rather dramatically.  So I think that’s a reasonably comforting idea. Finally, the fixed-income markets and high-yield markets certainly have moved higher in terms of spreads but, again, not a lot by historical perspectives.  Under normal market conditions or more-pessimistic market conditions than we have now, that move, even a small relative move, would have slowed down those pipelines.  Instead, liquidity is plentiful.  A couple of anecdotes that we heard before describe the situation:  25 or 30 basis points in the high-yield markets are not changing activity.  They’re not changing the interest of investment banks and issuers in coming to market as quickly as they can.  So in terms of market functioning, apart from price, those markets are working exceptionally well. What would be a reason for pessimism, and what would be a reason to think that the volatility that has been discussed over the past several weeks might turn into real volatility?  One thing that I look to with some degree of concern is the prices that are being paid and the leverage that’s being put on companies that could change the liquidity in those markets very quickly.  I wouldn’t be surprised to find—over the forecast period for sure and maybe even over 2006—a “club” deal in which many private equity partners group together in a highly leveraged situation to buy a very large public company and take it private and, after the course of due diligence and of that acquisition, the deal closes and they find that they missed the first coupon.  That is, the leverage that is being put on these companies, for all the reasons we have discussed around this table, is relatively remarkable.  Those leverage ratios used to sound like purchase prices, and they’re expecting meaningful cost savings that can come out of these businesses six and nine months out.  I suppose I’m concerned that, as these deals come together, there might be a negative surprise that affects the company so that the first coupon would be impossible or difficult to meet.  In that circumstance, all the optimism that I’ve described in terms of these debt markets could dissipate rather markedly.  So I don’t want to suggest a degree of optimism that isn’t borne out by the facts.  That’s something we need to continue to stay attuned to.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"211";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I continue in my concern, which I expressed at the last meeting, about the recent pickup in inflation, especially given the news that we’ve had since the last meeting.  In the past three months, core CPI prices and core PCE prices have grown, respectively, at 3.8 percent and 3.4 percent, twice their rate of growth in the previous three months.   It has been interesting to listen to and read the analyses that many folks are doing, trying to parse the reasons for the jump in the inflation rates, no matter what index people are following. The question, as several of you have mentioned, is really whether the reason is persistent inflation or whether it’s one-off kinds of changes.  We’ve already had several thoughts about how to look at the relation of energy-price increases and their persistence to the rate of inflation. I won’t add any more to what has already been said, but I thought Mr. Wilcox had a good discussion of the owners’ equivalent rent problem.  What are we really looking at here?  Some of the possibilities I found amusing.  One of them, for example, pointed out that the index used to look at the cost of bank services was up significantly because the opportunity cost on demand deposits had gone up.  If that’s the problem, we can cure it by just stopping the raising of rates. [Laughter]  So I do think we need to really focus on where we are.  Without being able to really understand the underlying framework here, I am very concerned about the trend. When I looked at the dramatic drop in forecast growth, at first I became very pessimistic about the outlook, as several of you have also commented.  But the more I looked at the numbers, the more I came to realize that the reduction is all coming from residential housing construction.  Everything else is basically a push from the last forecast for this year and next year.  When I look at the forecast with that perspective, I see things differently.  I’ve been concerned about the amount of speculation in housing construction throughout the country.  To the extent that what’s coming out of the housing sector is this excess speculation, that’s healthy both for the long-run economy and for the stability of the financial system.  One of our challenges in looking at some of the recent indicators is to determine whether we will really have a soft transition to more sustainable long-term growth of new housing or whether the transition will be bumpier or perhaps more abrupt.  A chart in the Greenbook that got my attention was how rapidly the cancellation of sales orders for new housing had jumped within the past five months, from its long-run trend of 22 percent since ’95 to a high rate of 30 percent.  Some of these sales data or permit data that we’re seeing today may mean more additions to excess inventory, and so we may see more of a blip; that’s something I think we need to watch.  I think we can’t be complacent that a nice easing into long-term sustainable growth of housing is a sure thing at this point. At the same time, because the drop in the forecast is all housing, the question is how to look at the relative growth of the rest of the economy.  Since on net it’s basically moving the way it was, I said to myself that I was comfortable with that.  But why am I uncomfortable going forward?  I, too, hear anecdotes about companies’ optimism about what they can do in terms of increasing revenues and profits. Regarding the capacity issue, we need to realize that a lot of the resources in housing construction are not necessarily transferable to other sectors, except perhaps to commercial real estate.  That sector is forecast to pick up, and so some of the growth could happen there.  But the inability to transfer resources still raises issues, in terms of both fixed investments and people, and I don’t believe that the apparent slowdown to below trend, since it is driven by housing construction, is really going to create much excess capacity.  So that situation makes me concerned about inflation. Finally, I’d like to talk about how housing affects liquidity and monetary policy and our accommodation.  Several of you and the staff said earlier that we have seen a bit of adjustment in debt spreads since the last meeting—and volatility is up—but we all agree that spreads are still very narrow by historical standards.  Focusing on the staff’s forecast of the flow of funds for the next two years, I found an interesting thing if you look at what’s happening when housing drops to the level forecasted in the Greenbook.  Households, in borrowing for mortgages, basically have been the major user of net borrowing in the past couple of years.  The forecast is for households’ need for funds, the net borrowing, to drop one-third between 2005 and 2007.  The amount by which net household borrowing drops is more than the borrowing by all other sectors combined last year.  So part of the issue is that, because households are such a powerful engine in net borrowing, there will be plenty of funds available.  Also, as to the extent that bank borrowing and funds provision are forecast to drop, the bankers I talked with said that they aren’t going to let the amount of loans that they extend drop as much as I think is in that forecast.  So I really believe that the drop in housing is actually on net going to make liquidity available for other sectors rather than being a drain going forward and that will also get the growth rate more positive than the current Greenbook forecasts."
"212";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  New England’s economy remains in relatively good shape, though not particularly vibrant or reflective of great strength going forward.  Employment growth has been positive but slow in comparison to the nation.  New England usually has a lower unemployment rate than the nation does, but for the first time in a decade or so the region’s unemployment rate has converged, mostly because the national rate dropped, but the region has flattened out over the past several months. Local measures of year-over-year inflation are about on track with the nation as well, though growth of local fuel and utility costs is considerably higher.  Many business people talk about their efforts to limit their energy costs by upgrading capital equipment and facilities to be more energy efficient and by looking into alternative sources of energy.  They also report mild success in passing along increased costs to consumers.  Perhaps reflecting this, the rising price of gasoline, or even the consistently rainy weather over the past couple of months, consumer confidence has sagged a good deal. But not all the news is gloomy.  Business sentiment, as suggested by surveys and our meetings with our Small Business Advisory Group, remains positive overall as businesses report solid growth and positive hiring plans.  Many continue to note how hard it is to find the skilled labor they need.  Class A office vacancies have declined in both downtown and suburban markets, and rents are rising a bit.  State tax collections, in particular sales and personal income taxes, are exceeding budgets in every state except Rhode Island, which appears to be experiencing an extended, though as yet unexplained, soft spot. In general, I sense a good deal of optimism among my business contacts about their own firms but uncertainty as well when they look at the evolution of both the regional and the national economies.  Indeed, both the coincident regional index done by the Philadelphia Fed and the leading index for Massachusetts that’s done by the University of Massachusetts indicate that the regional economy is likely to grow only at a modest pace over the next year or so, buoyed by a resurgence in worldwide demand for high-tech and biotech products but weighed down by subdued consumer spending in the midst of high energy costs and declines in local housing markets. I just want to reflect a bit on regional residential real estate markets.  Here various data sources—and there are lots of them—suggest that regional markets have slowed, with sales falling in April and to a lesser degree in May, and unsold inventories continuing to rise, with the number of months’ supply growing from about 8.7 in May of last year to more than 11 in May of this year.  However, prices, depending on whether you look at median sales or repeat sales, either have fallen only slightly or have risen at about half the pace they had been rising.  Most analysts see this as a soft landing or a period of stabilization after several years of strong price appreciation.  Thus, while the local media and many pundits, national as well as local, wring their hands over the potential for major real estate problems, at least up to now the market correction in New England appears to be proceeding in a fairly benign way. Turning to the national scene, incoming data have served to reinforce a sense of risk on both sides of the Greenbook forecast.  As I noted earlier, that forecast is not markedly different from our own, so when I talk about risk it will be the risk to our own forecast as well.  To some degree, both slower growth and higher inflation were expected in the forecasts that we’ve made over the past six months or so, but recent data may be exceeding those expectations.  On the growth side, residential construction has slowed a bit more rapidly than we thought.  Consumer confidence has fallen off.  Weaker equity markets, higher gas prices, and somewhat lower housing prices have likely affected consumer spending, and recent data on job growth have been slower. But there continue to be a good number of supports to growth.  Household wealth remains high.  Growth abroad remains solid.  Financial conditions outside equity markets are accommodative.  Businesses remain highly profitable and cash rich as reflected in the mini-boom in investment in nonresidential structures, and productivity growth remains strong.  Indeed, if one averages Q1 and Q2 expected growth, it’s a bit above our earlier forecast, though clearly one needs to be mindful of the fact that the first half started with a bang and its recent momentum has been considerably cooler. Does this recent cooling portend a faster and steeper slowdown for the rest of ’06 than reflected in the current Greenbook forecast or our own?  Or could there be enough underlying strength to take us back to the growth scenario of our earlier projections?  In particular, I wonder a bit about the slow rate of job growth that is embedded in the Greenbook forecast for 2007.  I don’t know what the possibility is of some surprise on the upside to the Greenbook’s current ’06 and, particularly, ’07 projections, but I think there may well be some. The incoming data have been more disquieting on the price front.  I’m not a person who believes that a given level of inflation is bad in and of itself, within reason of course.  I think it’s important to assess the level of inflation against everything else going on in the economy.  So at times a level of 2 percent and change might be fine; at other times it might bear watching.  And as far as I know, it’s been hard to prove that specific low levels of inflation—let’s say, below 3 percent—are bad in and of themselves.  But I do believe that a rapid increase or decrease in the rate of inflation growth can portend debilitating change in the economy.  Such increases or decreases need to be monitored carefully and figure importantly in the policy discussion.  Thus, I have viewed the six- and three-month changes in core CPI and PCE with some alarm as the rate of change has been faster than I am comfortable with and certainly faster than our forecast expected. Looking at the first half of this year, and using the Greenbook forecast for Q2, we see that core inflation is nearly 50 basis points higher than what we, in Boston at least, had expected. Our analysis suggests that most of the reason for this surge in inflation over the past couple of years has been higher energy costs.  Barring untoward geopolitical events, that should mean that inflation growth will moderate.  But given the small to nonexistent output gap we see currently reflected in the low unemployment rate, there is more than a minor risk that resource pressures could begin to play a role in inflationary growth.  The Greenbook forecast suggests that slower growth will provide a moderating influence on inflation.  That’s our best bet as well, but prudent risk management might suggest some hedging of that bet.  Thank you."
"213";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Much like the Greenbook, the reports that I hear from my directors and business contacts are consistent with an economy that is expanding, but at a slower pace than earlier this year.  Activity related to residential real estate has softened, and I continue to hear from my business contacts that they are concerned that consumer spending will retrench in response to the softer housing market and higher energy prices.  But I do not get much indication that this concern is having a substantial effect on their business plans.  Capital spending plans in particular seem little changed from the beginning of this year. As for inflation, rising costs are widely reported by my business contacts, but most of these pressures are still related to energy and material prices.  I continue to hear that productivity-adjusted wage pressures remain in check.  Among producers of intermediate goods, the number of firms that report the ability to pass through costs seems to be increasing, but as of now, I am not hearing a lot in the way of substantial price increases at the retail level. Despite what I am hearing from my business contacts, the data tell a different story, and they have affected my thinking since our last meeting.  The core inflation numbers have been drifting up, whether calculated by excluding food and energy or by the trimmed mean and median CPI measures that we monitor in Cleveland.  Since December the majority of items in the CPI weighted by their expenditure shares have risen at annual rates in excess of 3 percent.  It is still possible, of course, that the pattern of these price increases that have been showing up lately is just an outsized but transitory pass-through of energy and commodity prices or the realignment of rents to the exceptional residential housing market that we have seen in the past few years.  But this explanation is becoming increasingly difficult for me to defend. At our May meeting I expressed concerns that risks were weighted against both our objectives, and the Greenbook baseline now reflects those concerns:  weaker economic growth and higher inflation.  At this time, I do not see any signs that the real economy is going to be weaker than projected in the Greenbook baseline, but unfortunately I do not expect an inflation outlook that is much better than the Greenbook baseline either.  That is my report, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you."
"214";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff presentations make abundantly clear that most of the data we have received since we met in May have been disappointing in one way or another.  Recent economic activity appears to have been quite a bit weaker than expected, as exemplified by the Greenbook, which shows a significant downward revision to 2 percent growth in the current quarter and a noticeable downward adjustment to 2¾ percent in the second half of this year.  However, in view of the possibility that labor and product markets may have moved a bit beyond full utilization, as well as the recent high readings on core inflation, a period of growth a bit below potential could be seen as necessary to prevent a buildup of underlying inflationary pressures. Under the assumption of one more funds rate increase at this meeting, it seems reasonable to me that growth will remain somewhat below its potential rate, that the unemployment rate will gradually trend upward to slightly above the NAIRU by the end of next year, and that core inflation will gradually move down toward my comfort zone.  If things work out that way, I suppose the outcome would be nearly optimal, given that we are starting from an undesirably high inflation figure in the second quarter. My concern is that it is very difficult at this stage to rule out a much less desirable scenario in which the lagged effects of our earlier reactions restrain activity more strongly and more persistently than we now expect.  We might also see further financial disruptions as a consequence of investors’ increased risk aversion, which is the bearish possibility that Dino described earlier.  In other words, the question is whether the large surprise in the second quarter will be followed by a series of similar surprises later this year.  I am concerned about downside risks to the real outlook, especially until we can better gauge the magnitude of the repercussions from the weakening in housing markets that now clearly is under way. The data on core inflation in recent months present the opposite concern, having been higher than expected and pushing core inflation slightly above my comfort zone over the past year.  This raises the possibility that we are making systematic errors in our understanding of the fundamental forces driving inflation.  The key question is whether the necessary decline in inflation requires more action from us or whether inflation is being pushed up by temporary factors that will dissipate on their own.  The Greenbook, I think quite reasonably, shows core inflation edging down over the next year and a half as the effects of several temporary factors abate.  One possibility in this regard is that there has been a modest pass-through from energy-price increases to core inflation and that these effects will dissipate if energy prices stabilize at today’s elevated levels.  Moreover, part of the recent uptick traces to large increases in housing costs that are finally showing up in the CPI just as the housing market is slowing.  As David noted in his briefing, the CPI measure of changes in housing prices for owner-occupied housing reflects movements in market rental rates rather than house prices and interest rates. After long being stagnant or even falling, rents are finally moving up.  Perhaps with higher mortgage interest rates and lower expectations of house-price appreciation, speculative properties are being dumped into the market, and families in the market for housing are now more inclined to rent rather than buy, driving rents up and housing prices down.  It certainly would not be surprising to see a return to a more normal relationship between rents and house prices.  Such a phenomenon, if it is now playing out, would most likely be transitory rather than permanent, although it could play out for quite some time. Unfortunately, at this point it is difficult to tell how much of the recent rise in core inflation is temporary and how much is due to underlying inflation pressures like tight labor and product markets, which would suggest a more persistent problem for policy.  I would feel more concerned were it not for the largely reassuring data on productivity, labor compensation, and profit margins. That said, the good news is all in the forecast, whereas the bad news is in the data.  So I certainly can’t rule out the possibility that the increase in core inflation in the second quarter is the leading edge of a developing trend. In summary, I think the most likely scenario is a relatively benign one.  However, we have had some rather large surprises in both output and inflation since we last met.  It seems to me that, in the policy round coming up, the more important matters are the risks that growth could slow much more than now seems likely or that inflation could prove to be a more serious problem than I currently expect it to be or, for that matter, that both factors could come into play.  It is unlikely that we will be able to sharpen our assessment of these risks very much until more time passes and more data become available."
"215";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060629meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I guess I’d say the center of gravity of this discussion is a little stronger than the Greenbook, and I think that’s pretty much where we are, too.  We expect real GDP growth to follow a path pretty close to potential in the balance of ’06 and in ’07, and we expect core PCE inflation to moderate gradually to around 2 percent in ’07.  This forecast assumes a monetary policy path close to that of the Greenbook, somewhat under the market’s forecast.  Since May, in our view, the balance of risks has shifted a bit toward the less-favorable mix of somewhat more downside risk to real growth and somewhat more upside risk to inflation.  Relative to the Greenbook, however, this implies that we have a stronger trajectory for demand growth and a slightly lower path for inflation. On the growth side, I guess I’d say we see a pretty healthy adjustment process under way with a change in the composition of growth.  We don’t see the incoming data, the anecdotes, and the recent developments in financial markets as supporting the view that real growth is likely to stay significantly below potential over the full forecast period.  We had already anticipated the slowdown in residential investment that has now materialized; therefore, we didn’t see that as a basis for revising down our forecast.  We believe the changes in household wealth in general have less effect on consumption than the Board staff believes, and as a result we expect a more modest deceleration in growth.  We expect stronger employment growth, too, and we have a stronger view of the rate of growth in private investment going forward.  The world economy still looks pretty robust to us.  So overall, in our view, this supports a forecast for the economy to be growing at a rate a bit above 3 percent over the next year and a half. But the risks to this forecast of growth seem a little less balanced than they did in May. We see less chance that the expansion is going to reaccelerate to a pace significantly above potential, and we see a bit more chance for a weaker outcome.  The principal source of downside risk to us remains the possibility that households are going to reduce consumption growth significantly because they feel less rich, less secure, less comfortable borrowing, and less certain about the future. On the inflation outlook, we have moved up our expected trajectory for core PCE price inflation, but we still expect this measure to moderate, as I said, to around 2 percent by the end of ’07.  This forecast is pretty favorable.  It rests on the familiar fundamental forces of energy prices, if they follow the futures curve, becoming a source of moderation to price pressure going forward.  Strong productivity growth keeps unit labor costs from accelerating sharply.  Profit margins adjust to absorb any increase in unit labor costs that might come if labor’s share starts to move back toward its historical average.  Growth of aggregate demand moderates to potential— it probably has already moderated to potential—which attenuates the risk of further upside pressure on resource utilization going forward.  Most important, long-term inflation expectations have come down a bit.  They remain in the range of the past few years, and they have proven responsive to changes in policy expectations in a more reassuring way than we saw very recently. As in May, however, we believe the risks to this forecast are still somewhat to the upside because of the following:  Headline inflation and near-term inflation expectations have been running substantially above core for some time.  Virtually all the ways we try to capture underlying inflation have been running above core.  The recent rise in core may imply more momentum in inflation dynamics.  You might say that long-term inflation expectations are a little higher than we want over time, and they may have been too responsive to changes in the incoming data.  The medium-term trajectory for the dollar seems likely to be down.  Profit margins, for reasons we don’t fully understand, have been very high and have been rising, and maybe that tells us something about inflation psychology that we don’t see in the long-term breakevens and TIPS.  The long-term forecasts of inflation that the staff presentations give us show a lot of persistence of inflation.  Inflation falls very, very slowly over time; and if that path is right, it could cause some further damage to inflation psychology. If you just step back and look at how much our expectations and the markets’ expectations about the terminal rate, the funds rate at which we’d stop tightening, have changed over the past two years, it’s really remarkable.  The expectations eighteen months ago were about 200 basis points below where we are now.  That change may imply that we will learn in retrospect that we were too loose for too long, and therefore we’ll have to do more than we thought to counteract that effect on inflation.  That’s a possibility, not a prediction. So as I said in the beginning, in some sense the balance of risks has shifted in a way that complicates the monetary policy choice for us, and the shift leaves us with less confidence about the appropriate path for policy going forward.  On balance, monetary policy appears to be getting some traction in the United States, and the expansion still looks to be in good shape.  Inflation risks seem a bit tilted to the upside, and monetary policy needs to continue to be directed at ensuring significant moderation in the trajectory of inflation over the next few years.  Thank you."
"216";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you. We are ready for our economic outlook go-round. For President Plosser’s benefit, I will say that we have two go-rounds.  The first is on the economic outlook, and the second is on policy issues.  One hand means you want to be recognized, and Michelle will put your name on the list.  If you want to interject a question or a comment, we have two-handed interventions. Who would like to go first? President Moskow.,  President Yellen.,  Thank you. President Fisher.,  Thank you.

President Stern.,  President Hoenig.,  Thank you.  President Poole.,  Thank you. Vice Chairman Geithner.,  Thank you. Governor Kohn.,  Thank you. Governor Bies.,  Thank you. I see it’s 11:00, and I’m told that coffee is ready outside. Why don’t we take a fifteen-minute break.  Thank you. [Coffee break],  David Wilcox has a couple of comments on the productivity data from this morning.,  Thank you.  Let’s turn now to Governor Warsh.,  Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,  Thank you.  Let me briefly summarize what I’ve heard and add a few comments. I think one thing we can conclude is that this is not getting any easier. [Laughter] Starting with the data, which are not cooperating, the NIPA revisions show that potential growth may be less than we thought and, therefore, we may have to have more of a slowdown, if we believe in the Phillips curve, to begin to contain inflation.  The small bit of comfort I take is that the slowdown in potential and productivity appears to be coming from capital rather than from multifactor productivity; so at least that technological component still seems to be with us. The question is whether we are, in fact, slowing to potential or to slightly below potential.  I agree with most of what I heard around the table, which is that there is evidence of slowing but, except for the residential construction sector, it is not yet at all definitive that we are falling below potential growth rates.  For example, the staff estimated that GDP growth in the second quarter was 3 percent. The staff also estimated that the slower rate of job creation we saw in the second quarter is still fairly close to what is needed to keep the unemployment rate constant. We are certainly seeing areas of strength in the economy, as a number of people noted.  That includes the industrial sector—which will grow 0.7 or 0.8 percent, something like that, overall in July—and nonresidential construction, which has been strong enough that so far there has not been a net decline in construction jobs in the United States.  So there certainly are some strong elements of the economy. I’d like to talk about the very important housing sector, in terms not of the expected level but of the variance of our forecast, which I think we must think about given our risk-management approach.  At least three dimensions of the housing sector provide significant uncertainty as we look forward.  The first is the extent to which sales, starts, and permits will decline.  The correction in the housing market so far appears to be fairly substantial.  In 2005, we had 1.72 million starts.  For June, the number of adjusted permits was 1.45 million.  We already have a 15 percent decline in the level of construction.  As Governor Kroszner pointed out, the curve doesn’t look as though it’s flattening out; it looks as though it’s heading directly south.  We have heard anecdotally that cancellations are up very sharply.  Inventories are rising significantly, and I note that, just since the last meeting, the GDP contribution estimated by the staff for housing construction went from minus 0.3 percent to minus 0.6 percent.  So there is, I think, a lot of uncertainty about where that sector is going to level out. Second, associated with that consideration is a lot of uncertainty about housing prices. Again, as Governor Kroszner noted, we don’t really have much information on what the “true price” of housing is at this point because of the way this market works:  People leave things on the market for a long time; they take them off the market; they provide incentives; and so on.  So we don’t really see the transaction prices in any kind of quality-adjusted or reliable way for some time after the decline begins.  The prices are significant, of course, both because they affect the profitability of future construction and because they are, at this point, an important component of household wealth; we know that these factors are likely to affect spending. Finally, a third element of uncertainty as we look into the forecast is what I would call parameter risk, which is that the staff assumes that the effect of housing wealth on consumption spending is, through the standard wealth effect, about four cents on the dollar.  I happen to think that is a good estimate.  I think the econometric calculations are persuasive.  Nevertheless, there is the possibility that the effect is somewhat greater, perhaps operating through liquidity effects.  There may be buffer stock effects.  If people see their equity falling, they may become more cautious about spending in order to avoid eliminating their buffer of reserves.  Thus there is the possibility that housing will have a stronger effect on consumption than we now expect. I don’t know what the expected growth rate is.  If I had to take a guess, I would say that we’re going to be close to or slightly below potential going forward, but I simply want to point out that our forecast may have a higher variance now than it does under normal circumstances. Let me say just a few words about inflation.  I heard a lot of concern about inflation around the table.  I certainly share that concern, and I don’t expect any near-term improvement, if for no other reason than that these things tend to be highly inertial.  I also agree with the general observation that the pickup is fairly broad based, as I discussed in the meeting last time.  One indicator of that is the share of goods that have price increases or price increases above a certain level. I tried a somewhat different exercise, and I didn’t do it in any way as an apologist for inflation—I want to be very clear.  But I think it’s useful to look at inflation from a different approach, which is to ask what share of the inflation acceleration is attributable to different components.  So I asked for a look at the past three months versus the past twelve months to examine the acceleration between those two periods.  In a sort of growth-accounting exercise, how can we distribute that acceleration among different components? I have just a few observations from that exercise.  First, the shelter component really does play a big role.  For example, in this particular calculation, which is somewhat sensitive to sample period, of the 71 basis point increase in the core CPI between twelve months and three months, 48 basis points were associated with the shelter increase.  So that component is significant, and our views on where it will go and how that relates to the developments in the housing market need to be thought about.  A second observation is that we are seeing energy pass-through, a good example being air fares, which have jumped significantly and which by themselves contribute 19 basis points to the acceleration.  So energy pass-through is real.  A somewhat more subtle point, which was made in the Greenbook and which I think is interesting, is that there’s a little different behavior between inflation in goods and inflation in non-energy, nonshelter services.  Inflation in services has been generally flat.  In goods, however, we have seen a bit of acceleration, from a negative number in ’05 to a slightly positive number in ’06.  Examples would be the rise in prices in apparel and, more recently, in used cars.  In just examining clues, I think that acceleration might say something about international competition, the effects of the declining dollar, and the possibility that import competition has weakened to some extent and is allowing prices of tradable goods to rise a bit more quickly. One theme that is consistent regarding the energy pass-through and the perhaps slightly greater inflation in tradable goods is that an important component of the inflation is product market tightness as opposed to labor market tightness.  That suggests that, as we go forward, we should pay a lot of attention to final demand and consumption and see how they are affecting the product markets.  My own guess is that unit labor costs and wages will be somewhat lagging; and I think that, if the product markets slow and the slowing reduces pricing power, as we call it, those effects will ultimately have effects on the markup that will offset some of the wage effects. So those are just a few observations about the economy.  To summarize, I agree with the sentiment around the table that there is a lot of uncertainty going forward, particularly in the housing sector, but that the inflation risks at this point are still dominant and that our policy action and statement should reflect the greater concern with inflation.  On the subject of policy, let me now turn to Brian, who will present the policy options."
"217";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, at our last FOMC meeting in my now over one-year-long attempt to stay away from any analogies referring to innings or baseball [laughter], I used the analogy of Phil Mickelson at the U.S. Open to suggest an opposite strategy.  What I suggested was that we use the minutes we are about to release and especially your testimony, if you recall, to center the ball on the fairway so that we could approach the green from the point of this meeting.  It appears now that we have done that, you have done that, and the minutes have done that, and we are basically at a point where we are confident of either a hawkish pause or one more tightening of the screw in terms of raising the federal funds rate. The Greenbook and the Bluebook do a good job of presenting us with an analytical framework for this meeting.  I want to compliment them, with an “i,” but I also thought it might be helpful to complement them, with an “e,” with some of the data and inputs from our business contacts and the work of our own research staff on the issues we have been talking about. Let me start with housing.  I regularly talk to CEOs of two of the five big builders.  They like using analogies. In the words of the second largest builder in the country, “The pig is still in the python.” That is, he expects the decline from peak to trough in home sales to exceed that forecast in the Greenbook.  I think we had 17½ percent; he is talking about a correction of 25 percent. To adhere to the convention of reporting on my District, which we are supposed to do, I’m happy to say that only Texas, where our economy is on the verge of employing ten million workers, is holding up in the books of these two homebuilders.  Even the Carolinas are starting to fold over, and the weakest area is California.  The Big Five builders and other homebuilders are reacting as you might expect.  They are cutting staff.  They are renegotiating their prices and getting concessions from their subcontractors.  They are walking away from their planned land deals, and they are renegotiating existing contracts.  This is what a macroeconomist would expect in reaction.  In answer to Cathy’s and David’s questions, one CEO, who has been in the business since 1973, reports that this correction is the roughest and most sudden he has seen, with one exception. That exception is that the industry is significantly consolidated, with most of the big builders either supporting very strong balance sheets or having ready accessibility to capital from a flush banking system and eager private equity groups.  So the reports I received from the Big Five are that, while they are wringing their hands, they’re also licking their chops; they are plotting acquisitions of smaller, weaker builders when they reach the depths of despair. This situation may signal the prospect of a shorter turnaround time for a correction, or it may not, but I just throw it out for your contemplation. Clearly, however, the housing downturn and the cumulative effect of energy and electricity price increases are having an effect.  One of my contacts is the CEO of a large “casual dining” restaurant chain, which employs 110,000 out of the 4.8 million people employed in that segment of the restaurant business.  He reports that his utility costs this year have risen 30 percent and his materials costs have risen 15 percent.  Although customers are moving downscale in terms of the dining chain, guest counts for that segment of the market, which again employs 4.8 million people, are down 5 percent in the last week, and he sees that trend continuing. The CEO of a national middle price point retailer reported that furniture sales in July were down 21 percent. A low-end price point retailer—the low-end price point being Wal-Mart to 7-Eleven—reports slowing traffic. In the words of the head of Wal-Mart USA, John Menzer, “What we saw last month is getting worse.”  So-called morning madness sales, which are common in September, have been moved up to July and August. The railroads report a significant slowdown over the past four weeks in the shipment of forest products. So we do have a slowdown, although it is important to point out that the rails, according to the companies themselves, expect to increase traffic 3 percent during the second half because of industrial demand.  UPS reports through its CFO that it is shipping 13.2 million packages a day, which is down from about 13.5 in the first half but up from 12.7 in ’05. Incidentally, their report last quarter proved to be remarkably accurate in terms of their expected growth for the second quarter, if it, in turn, is revised upward toward 3 percent.  So I want to stick with what I reported at the June FOMC meeting—that our “roadster” economy has downshifted in growth. I also reported a sense that inflation pressure gauge needles were moving forward, and my soundings this time indicate that they continue to do so.  I thought that the briefing the staff gave to the Board and circulated to us was very helpful, and I appreciate very much the discussion we had earlier on inflation in answer to President Poole’s question.  It is important to point out that the monthly trimmed mean PCE inflation rate in June was 3.1 percent.  On a twelve-month basis, it picked up to 2.7 percent.  But very importantly—if, as President Poole suggested, you break down the PCE components, whether you trim it or you use it “fully garbed” [laughter]—83 percent of the components are increasing in price.  That is up from 73 percent in April. What that means is that only 17 percent of prices are falling compared with 27 percent two months ago. We know that inflationary pressures are building abroad.  Karen, our work in Dallas is very much in its infancy; but to the extent that it helps, our measurement of industrial capacity utilization in all the large member states of the European Union is up.  Recent revisions to the United Kingdom’s national accounts indicate that the Brits are operating closer to capacity; and if you look at the Tankan survey, for the first time in more than a decade, Japan is reporting capacity constraints. Like everybody else, we have no reliable data on China and India, but we know that their economies are steaming along.  As they grow, they cut into existing global capacity available to U.S. businesses.  Let me give you an example.  Our shipping CEOs report that a portion of the international fleet of large bulk carriers, although they estimate that this portion is only about 2 percent, has now been rerouted and is being used for intracoastal, intra-Chinese trade.  So at a time of the year when usually the rates cave for these Panamax ships, which are the largest bulk carriers, the daily rate has stiffened another $1,000.  It is up to $23,000 from the $22,000 that I reported at our last meeting, even though this is usually the soft time of the year.  Just for a reference point, last year at this time it was one-half that price. At home our bankers report, in the words of the CEO of the largest bank in Texas, “more talk about price increases and pass-throughs.”  We are seeing the return in our District of the term “air ball financing,” which is financing based on prospects not on hard reality.  One example that caught my interest, which is yet unreported in the public press, is that, according to the CEO of a large corporation with a $30 billion market capitalization, they have been approached by a single buyout group to take them private.  So there is a lot of liquidity left in the system. The CEO of Wal-Mart USA reports that they are building in a price increase of 1 percent this year. It is the first increase in a long, long time.  Typically they built in minus 1 percent to minus 2 percent.  The increase was confirmed by the CEO of one of Wal-Mart’s largest suppliers of nongrocery goods, who quoted Lee Scott as telling him last week, “We are reaching the limits of productivity enhancement and may have to take it out in price increases.”  Kimberly-Clark’s CEO reports that he started the year planning for an inflation factor in their cost of goods sold of $150 million.  It has been ratcheted up in two intervals and is now at $350 million.  He reports that they are covering increases in the cost of goods sold through price increases.  This is in sharp contrast to what he has been telling me before every previous meeting. Food processors report the same.  It might be noteworthy that corn prices—even though we don’t include them in the core PCE—are, because of ethanol production, up significantly. That’s very unusual at this time of the year.  Frito-Lay’s CEO reports an overall inflation shift— in his own words, “the ability to pass through price increases and make them stick.” Finally, Mr. Chairman, at a recent meeting you asked about my reports from Hewitt, the consulting company, regarding the prospects for health care costs.  According to one of my sources, several of the largest insurers are focusing on a settlement range of roughly 7 percent to 8½ percent growth for next year. It is a little more than they had expected; it is roughly what it was last year. I might point out that those companies cover a large number of people. To supplement this input, I touched base with three people I consider to be the best long-term practitioners in the fund-management business.  Each one has been in the business for more than thirty years.  Besides reporting continued high appetites for risk and continued elevated liquidity in the marketplace, these gnarly old-timers report a shift in the attitude of businesses that they cover in investing. To quote one, “Before, the operators we deal with were worried about getting their heads handed to them if they tried to pass through price increases; now they’re trying to see what they can get away with.”  In summary, the CEO of Cadbury Schweppes—to kill the serpentine analogy—says that “we’re just not through the snake yet on inflation.” Mr. Chairman, this is a long and faithful report.  For all the inherent risks, I pay close attention to what I hear from my CEO contacts.  According to them, in addition to the data that we are seeing, the economy is slowing from its torrid pace of growth and downshifting to a more normal range.  Global capacity and utilization are not slowing apace from what we can see, or if they are slowing, overall global capacity utilization is staying at an even level.  It is also clear that the business community has its finger poised on the trigger of price increases.  It may well be that the lagged effect of our de-accommodation has yet to temper the price equation.  It may be that energy prices and other cost-push factors are at a point of tapering off.  It may be that moderation in the domestic economy’s growth rate will remove demand-pull potential, and it may be that tightening measures of our counterparts abroad will tamp down input prices for our producers here, although it could have a counter-effect in terms of the exchange rate effect on the costs of imports.  But I do want to ask us to remember that inflation is—as stated in a paper that was circulated previously—an inertial process.  (The paper may have been from you, Bill.)  We must be very careful in word and in deed that we do not encourage impulses that will spur that inertia and that will prove harder and more costly to rein in further down the road.  Thank you."
"218";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In our last meeting I reported that, while our Southeast economy still seemed reasonably solid, we were beginning to pick up anecdotal signs that activity might be slowing.  Well, that sluggishness is now gradually showing up in the data as well. The slowing is perhaps most noticeable in our labor markets.  Although we are still hearing that businesses in some sectors are having problems finding workers, especially in areas such as construction, accounting, and housekeeping, payroll employment figures for June in our states were disappointing. They showed seasonally adjusted contraction with absolute declines reported in Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi and less-than-expected job growth in Florida. Employers seem to be trying their best to hold the line on staffing, given the sense that they have of a slowing in the pace of growth and an uncertain outlook. Manufacturing activity in our region is mixed.  Consumer spending remains softer than earlier in the year, and the tourism outlook is reported to be guardedly optimistic.  The bright spot in some ways is the Gulf Coast outside New Orleans, where the demand for most construction materials and labor and for replacement household and personal goods is strong; but that pocket of elevated spending is not enough to offset the sluggishness elsewhere.  The big semiannual apparel and gift mart show in Atlanta, where buyers just came to place their major orders for expected year-end holiday sales, was reported to have been slow. The regional bankers are reporting slowing in loan demand, particularly in the consumer housing sectors. However, the experience in C&I lending is more mixed.  At the same time, credit quality, in the words of two bankers with whom we talked, was “unsustainably” or “embarrassingly” good.  Banks are also pulling back on their lending into the softening housing market.  Our data indicate that single-family construction remained relatively strong in the District. Home sales have slowed, and there now have been sharp corrections in some markets, especially coastal Florida. Perhaps the most-talked-about new worry in our region, and something I mentioned for the first time at our last meeting, is the growing problem of obtaining affordable wind, flood, and related insurance in our coastal areas, resulting from the huge losses incurred by insurance companies from hurricanes in recent years.  Some carriers have quit offering coverage at any price, and costs of policies that are available have increased at extraordinary rates.  That problem is affecting residential construction and sales and causing some businesses to pull up stakes and move elsewhere. Together, the various developments that I have just ticked off have taken considerable momentum out of the strong economic growth and outlook we were seeing in our region earlier in the year. Our sense of what’s happening at the national level is much the same.  It now seems reasonably clear that we have settled into a pattern of slower and probably subpar growth.  We saw evidence of that in the second-quarter GDP data and in the markedly slower employment gains in recent months.  The several models that our Atlanta staff now employs to forecast real growth are suggesting somewhat slower growth in the 2½ percent to 3 percent range as being most likely over the second half of this year and through 2007. Getting a good handle on the inflation outlook is a bit harder.  Our most recent Atlanta modeling work produces a somewhat encouraging inflation path over the next 18 months, which suggests that core inflation should stop its upward drift and gradually begin to move back toward 2 percent. That optimistic outlook is consistent with the most likely path laid out in the Greenbook and with the central tendency of the forecasts we all submitted for the recent congressional testimony.  At the same time, even those optimistic forecasts do not seem to indicate that core inflation is likely to move comfortably to within the ranges many of us have indicated we would like eventually to see. Of course, these encouraging longer-term or medium-term, as some have been calling it, outlooks are very much at odds with the discouraging headline numbers and the increasingly higher core inflation readings in recent months.  There seems to be good reason to expect that some of the coming near-term inflation data could well be disappointing before we begin to see the expected improvement, and these current data help to shape inflation expectations.  In one of our recent briefings, an economist humbly observed that, despite all the work that has been done and continues to be done in the profession, our models for forecasting inflation are still less than stellar as judged by past experience. So we go into the policy discussion with some encouraging inflation forecasts but having to acknowledge wide error bands and considerable uncertainty around those forecasts. I look forward, I think, to an interesting but probably difficult policy discussion. [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"219";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, thank you.  Obviously we are dealing with a difficult set of circumstances.  We have information that the growth of the economy is slowing and inflation is rising, not something we particularly like to see.  We have seen slowing consumption nationally, and certainly our District has seen some of it.  The one exception is in some areas where we have an energy boom going on, which is not necessarily advantageous to other parts of the country. We also have slowing residential investment in our District.  Inventories are building up rapidly, both in the eastern side of the District and in the Denver western side, and we have some pretty sharp increases in bankruptcy levels in the Denver area.  The shocks of energy costs have affected consumption, and I think that effect will carry through.  We have been more optimistic about manufacturing.  Even though our surveys have shown some slowdown recently, the six-months-ahead forecasts are still fairly optimistic. There is no denying that the inflation level is up, and I think that increase reflects past policy accommodation that is still in play.  I also think that some of the supply shocks are having their effects, and the shocks themselves are continuing forward.  That situation is being aggravated a bit for our District, and perhaps will be even more for the nation, by the drought that we are experiencing, which is reducing some of the crop output in the area.  The outlook, therefore, is not particularly encouraging.  I think consumption will show some further slowing going forward, especially as we see further shocks in the economy related to energy.  Some of the wealth effects related to the housing industry will also affect consumption going forward. The outlook in terms of business fixed investment is unclear.  BFI has been pretty good. The outlook seems fairly good right now, but it is slowing to some degree.  Policy is moderately, not significantly, restrictive, but it seems to be working its way through fairly slowly. While these factors are in place, we worry about whether the real rate will decline, which I think Mike Moskow mentioned.  I also worry that the decline will affect inflation expectations and cause them to shift—that is an upside risk to the economy in terms of the inflation that I do worry about. Still, I suggest that we are moving as expected.  We have some short-term inflationary pressures that are going to continue, that are “baked in the cake,” as they say.  And I do worry that—as we move forward and if the economy slows, as I suspect it will—our big challenge will be not to ease too soon. Thank you."
"220";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have remarked, the inflation news over the intermeeting period was not favorable.  Core consumer prices continued to run at an elevated level, and the CPI actually came in on the high side of expectations.  The shortfall in the PCE that President Yellen referenced was, I think, more of those mysterious nonmarket components.  Petroleum prices rose further, implying additional feed-through going forward. Prices of other commodities, as Karen remarked, were on average unchanged to somewhat higher, suggesting not only continuing cost pressures on producers but sustained strength in global demand.  Early estimates of unit labor costs for the second half of last year and the first half of this year show a faster increase than had been estimated and anticipated.  The compensation data for the early part of this year, in particular, are subject to very large revisions. Even the now-faster growth doesn’t necessarily indicate that the economy has been operating beyond its sustainable potential, given the likelihood of some catch-up with past productivity gains, the still quite elevated profit margins, and the moderate increase in the ECI.  But at the very least, the unit labor cost story doesn’t provide as much comfort about future inflation as it did previously. Largely as a consequence, the staff revised up its inflation forecast for 2006 and 2007, and that response seems reasonable to me. At the same time, some developments over the intermeeting period help me feel a touch more comfortable, or perhaps a touch less uncomfortable, with the downward trajectory for inflation after the bulge.  One of them that a number of you have mentioned from surveys is that the long-term inflation expectations in the market remained stable or even edged down a little despite higher energy prices and, importantly, despite downward revisions to the expected path of monetary policy.  If I were forecasting today, I would forecast a slightly higher inflation rate, but I would also forecast a slightly higher unemployment rate than I did before.  To be sure, output gaps, as you’ve mentioned, don’t play a large role in determining inflation, but certainly the growth of demand relative to potential has some effect on the competitive conditions that businesses are facing and on their ability to pass through costs. From the information that we received over the intermeeting period, growth slightly below the growth rate of the economy’s potential seems more likely than it seemed a month or so ago, and this would inhibit the pass-through of higher energy and labor costs.  Weakness in the housing sector has deepened, and we have not yet seen the full implications of the rise in long-term and short-term interest rates over the first half of the year.  This weakness seems to be having an effect on housing prices as well as on activity.  The effects of a lower expected trajectory for housing wealth and the increase in interest rates this year haven’t begun to show through to consumption, judging from the minus 1½ percent saving rate.  The energy-price increases of recent weeks will take something more out of consumption. Recent data are consistent with a below-trend track for the growth of economic activity: Private domestic final purchases increased at a rate of only 2 percent in the second quarter.  The consumption and investment data for late months in the quarter don’t suggest an acceleration going into the third quarter. The growth of employment has been running slightly below what would be a steady-state pace if participation were to remain stable, and participation has edged higher. The greater increase than had been anticipated in inventories in the second quarter suggests little impetus or even a small drag from inventory accumulation in the third and fourth quarters. The growth of federal government spending seems to be dropping back a bit as Katrina-related expenditures top out. Moreover, the recent higher rates of core inflation, though they are puzzling to a considerable extent, must reflect some influences that are unlikely to be repeated indefinitely into the future. One of those is the rise in oil and energy prices.  The recent rise clearly has been associated with escalating tension in the Mideast and other producing areas, as well as the recent cutback in supply from Alaska.  At some point, the risks of supply disruptions, while remaining very high, should level out.  As a consequence, so, too, should energy prices, which will reduce core inflation as the feed-through fades. Another factor boosting inflation in recent months was related to rising rents and, in particular, to an even greater increase in owners’ equivalent rent.  The staff has assumed that owners’ equivalent rent will rise in line with other rents and that both will continue to increase fairly rapidly but less rapidly than they did.  That seems reasonable to me, given the increased availability of houses and apartments on the market that would, at some point, seem to limit the rise in rents as well as house prices. So my conclusion is that the staff forecast of a gradual moderation of core inflation after the second quarter is a reasonable expectation, although I am very worried about upside risks to inflation. The inflation rate looks as though it will end up a tad higher than either the staff or I thought likely at the time of our June meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"221";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you very much.  As the comments indicate, this is probably the most challenging time that we have had before us in my long history here at the FOMC.  [Laughter] The mix of continuing inflation pressures and decelerating growth are providing more concerns on both fronts than I have heard around the table and than I myself have had since I’ve been here. First let’s think about some of the growth prospects.  I broadly share the Vice Chairman’s view that the fundamentals are in place for reasonable growth going forward.  Certainly there are some risks.  But whether we are looking at survey-based measures, at orders and shipments, or at a variety of different things, we don’t really see signs of very significant deceleration or contraction. We see more a moderation that would be either in line with the Greenbook or a bit lower than the Greenbook. Certainly a key risk to growth that a lot of people have discussed is residential investment. If you look at where we are in residential investment, we’re back only to mid-2003; 2004 and 2005 were incredibly strong years.  So being in 2003 is not that bad.  If you look at the graph, residential investment falls off rather precipitously to get us back to 2003 with great rapidity.  The question I have is whether it will flatten out or whether it will go down further.  The Greenbook forecasts have gradually been moving down and now reflect more downward pressure going forward.  I think that we’re not seeing the full effects on house prices reflected in the numbers because in the housing market, for reasons I don’t think we fully understand, there tend to be queuing rather than just price changes.  So it may take a while for the price data to actually reflect the lower effective prices that people are seeing. Obviously house prices will have a potentially important effect on the wealth effect and on consumption down the line, which I think the Greenbook does a good job of putting into place. Another challenge is elevated prices for energy and commodities.  Energy prices, particularly, may be taking a little bite out of people’s disposable income.  On the other hand, we have been seeing continued strong business fixed investment.  A small concern I have is, if we continue to hear about slowing consumption and reports from Wal-Mart and others that retailing is really slowing, why are these businesses producing?  Are they investing to produce goods that people will want to buy, or will we see in nine months or a year that maybe some misallocation of resources has occurred and that things aren’t as strong as we had thought?  There’s no particular sign of such misallocation of investment.  It just seems that there is a bit of tension between the discussions of continued strength of capital expenditures and the statements of business contacts that they are going to continue to invest even though they see a slowing coming down the line.  This is a variation of what Governor Warsh was saying—it’s almost as though they are saying that some other sector will have that slowing, not their sector. In some sense, we should take very cold comfort from the fact that the economy may be slowing.  We had quite a discussion about how there’s not much of an inflation–output tradeoff, but at least in this period there are real questions of whether you do get much benefit in terms of lower inflation from slower growth.  There may be some benefit, but it seems to be attenuated compared with the past.  Obviously some of the recent numbers on inflation continue to be worrisome, but fortunately both the survey measures and the market-based measures seem to be reasonably contained looking forward.  Survey measures, whether of the man in the street or of the professional forecaster, seem to be quite flat.  The TIPS rates for both the near-term forwards and the longer-term forwards have not moved up much.  Some of the near-term forwards have moved up a bit, but that doesn’t seem surprising given the rise in energy prices that we have seen both from the Middle East and from issues in Alaska. The real key is looking forward as to what is likely to occur.  Are the things we’re seeing now transitory factors or persistent factors? That’s a very, very difficult call.  Reasonable arguments have been made that a number of these factors, particularly with respect to shelter services, are perhaps a bit more short-lived.  Shelter services are about 19 percent of core PCE and about 30 percent of core CPI, and obviously they have been leading the band up.  As many people have said, we have been seeing price increases in a lot of areas, but I don’t put quite as much stock in that because many of the categories in both the PCE and the CPI are arbitrary.  The issue is really what the relative size and the relative importance are.  Shelter services and owners’ equivalent rent, which composes a vast majority of shelter services, are an important piece.  I think that there’s a reasonable chance that this factor is likely to be transitory, although it may last for several months and possibly quarters.  But that is the key question—whether these forces are likely to be transitory or likely to be more persistent. Coming back to inflation expectations, that’s really where I see the markets both registering their view of persistence and telling us something about whether they believe that we will keep inflation well contained.  At least so far, those expectations are suggesting that we will.  It’s extremely important that we maintain those expectations.  It’s very costly to try to regain credibility if credibility is lost. I think the markets are willing to say, “Well, there may be some transitory inflation, and we’re willing to wait and see whether to mark up our longer-term expectations.” Certainly once longer-term expectations are marked up, the situation becomes highly problematic because it’s very difficult to rein in the changes in expectations, particularly in behavior.  So basically I think we need to keep a very, very watchful eye on where expectations are going.  I’m heartened that they haven’t moved too far despite, as many people have said, high core PCE prices for a number of years and elevated levels in the most recent numbers.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"222";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District’s economy remains generally strong, though overall growth appears to have moderated in recent weeks.  Retail sales have been lackluster, especially for big-ticket items.  Manufacturing shipments and new orders picked up in July, however, and our early readings for August are even stronger in suggesting additional momentum going forward.  District labor markets remain tight, with workers in some skill categories hard to find in urban areas and temporary workers in demand.  The housing market continues to slow generally, although markets differ significantly across our District. Current and expected price trend measures remain very elevated, according to our surveys, as they have been for most of the year. Turning to the national economy, I focused at our last two meetings on my concerns about the deteriorating outlook for inflation, and the news over the intermeeting period has heightened those concerns. But today I think it is important that we also assess carefully the outlook for output and employment.  I’m pretty sure that I can safely do so without danger of being viewed as an output nutter.  [Laughter] GDP growth has been choppy in recent quarters; but over the past year and a half, output has been growing at about 3½ percent. You get the same 3½ percent growth rate if you average over the past three and a half years.  We have substantially reduced the overhang of underutilized resources over that period. Employment has grown about 1½ percent a year, and the labor force has grown at just a little over 1 percent.  I think the evidence is now fairly persuasive that resources are approximately fully utilized in the sense that significant amounts of idle labor or capital do not seem to be awaiting the return of better times. What sorts of growth rates for output or employment are sustainable over the next two years?  The labor force appears likely to grow at about 1 percent—that is, about 110,000 jobs per month. Labor productivity has been trending around 2½ percent over the past couple of years, but I would be a bit more conservative going forward and expect about 2¼ percent per year, closer to the long-run average.  As a result, it seems reasonable to put the center point of an estimate of a sustainable real growth rate at about 3¼ percent, with perhaps some extra above that if you’re more optimistic about productivity growth. Is this trend our best near-term forecast?  Several factors could contribute to weaker real growth. Residential investment will contract in the coming quarters as the housing market cools, and lower average housing-price appreciation will reduce household wealth gains and damp consumption growth.  The upward sweep in energy prices has taken a bite out of real disposable income as well, but I would expect real household spending to track real household income going forward because both the housing-price adjustment and the energy-price run-up, so far at least, look more like one-time reductions in household wealth and income and not like sources of ongoing erosion extending out more than a year. So I think it is reasonable to expect consumption to grow at close to 3 percent, down a bit from the average of 3½ percent over the past several years. Other factors seem likely to bolster growth.  Business fixed investment spending has been expanding quite strongly in this recovery.  It is up at an annual rate of close to 7 percent since the beginning of 2003, despite the sluggishness of structures until this year.  In the second quarter, BFI was up 6.8 percent year-over-year, and the most recent high-frequency indicators remain on track. BFI spending as a share of GDP is still quite low by historical standards; and as the Greenbook points out, the fundamentals—business balance sheets and output growth—look quite solid. So it seems reasonable to expect business investment to continue to expand at a rate close to 7 percent. Putting everything together, I expect growth over the next year and a half to be just under 3 percent, or just more than ¼ percentage point below potential.  The Greenbook forecast is weaker—GDP growth at about 2¼ percent for the next six quarters—mainly because the Board staff sees lower business investment spending and a pronounced reversal in the household saving rate. I think that a healthy respect for the uncertainty involved suggests that reasonable confidence intervals around each of these forecasts—the Greenbook’s and my own and the others I’ve heard today, for that matter—would include all the other point estimates and, more important, would include the possibility that growth proceeds at potential over the forecast period and beyond. So though it is reasonable to expect growth at or less than potential in the near term, my sense is that it’s hard to be too certain that it will be much below for long. As I said at the outset, the inflation picture has only worsened.  The surge in core inflation that began in March has continued into June.  The monthly pattern—3.7 percent in March at an annual rate, 2.7 in April, 2.8 in May, and 2.9 in June—makes this episode look less and less like a temporary bulge and more and more like a sustained increase.  It is worth noting that the current acceleration in core inflation is broadly based, as the Greenbook emphasizes and President Poole ably articulated, and not attributable to any narrow set of special factors. The annual revisions to the national income and product accounts once again raised inflation for past years, although not that much this time, as President Yellen noted.  It now appears that year-over-year core PCE inflation has exceeded 2 percent every month since April 2004. Perhaps the most striking change in the annual revisions, however, was in wages and salaries. The puzzle of compensation growth bulging in 2005 and slowing in 2006 is now gone, and it is now clear that compensation is on a broad upswing.  The Board staff estimates that nonfarm business compensation per hour accelerated from a trend around 4 percent to something over 5½ percent. In fact, 5.4 percent was today’s release.  Unit labor costs have deteriorated accordingly and now show an annual rate of increase of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, according to today’s release, and they are up 3.2 percent year over year.  Before the NIPA revisions, the behavior of unit labor costs suggested that the current increase in inflation was not being incorporated into nominal wage compensation, but the labor cost data now show exactly the opposite—that the acceleration of inflation in recent months has induced a broad acceleration in nominal wages. I find it hard to be confident that a surge in unit labor costs is likely to be absorbed by falling markups.  Measured markups have been trending up for some time, and I think they still do after the revision. Our economic understanding of the determination of markups, especially at the macroeconomic level, is still quite limited.  In many models, the markup is entirely a real phenomenon and thus would be invariant with respect to purely nominal accelerations in costs. The main exceptions are the sticky-price models, but these don’t provide much comfort because in them a high markup is a forecast of accelerating nominal marginal cost—that is to say, an upswing in inflation. So I don’t take much comfort from the high level of markups. Combining the growth and inflation outlooks, it is worth thinking carefully about the extent to which we can expect slowing growth to bring inflation down.  There have been a number of skeptical comments about that hypothesis around the table today.  The relationship between output gaps and inflation is quite tenuous, as the staff rightly emphasizes whenever the subject comes up. Empirically, the ability to discover this relationship relies heavily on recessions and, thus, is much less reliable as an indicator of the effects on inflation of a small widening of the gap. Indeed, at our last meeting and again today, David Wilcox characterized the effect of the expected path of the output gap on inflation over the forecast period as tiny. The combination of uncertainty about the relationship between output gaps and inflation and the uncertainty about the degree to which growth is likely to fall short of potential should, I think, leave us deeply skeptical about whether we can rely on expected moderation in growth to bring inflation down.  It is unfortunate that so many commentators placed so much weight on that in response to our last statement. Let me add a comment or two about President Yellen’s most excellent statement.  I think the insights she articulated about backward-looking inflation models breaking down and the different inflation dynamics in forward-looking models is very important for our policy deliberations. Her staff apparently has documented that inflation now looks more as though it’s fluctuating around a sample average—I’ll say, a trend—and less as though it’s driven by output gap measures.  She concludes that we may see inflation fall faster than the Greenbook forecasts do. I want to register a couple of observations.  The first is that, with forward-looking expectations, inflation behavior is far more sensitive to changes in the public’s beliefs about our behavior than in models in which inflation expectations formation is backward looking.  I’d register just the possibility that the long-run expected inflation that the public believes applies has been drifting around and may, in fact, account for some of the swings of measured inflation around sample averages. Finally, certainly taking the point of view that inflation expectations are formed in a forward-looking manner makes more likely the possibility that inflation will come down faster than the Greenbook states.  But with inflation looking forward, it becomes our responsibility to bring that about.  So that happy outcome could require our action and our strong communication, but I would welcome inspecting, if I could, the work of President Yellen’s staff, and I welcome her contribution."
"223";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Seventh District moderated in the second quarter in line with our expectations after a very strong first quarter. Most of my directors and business contacts believe that added caution is taking hold in the economy.  Some think that growth will be noticeably slower in the second half of the year, and some believe that slowing will continue into 2007.  However, my contacts are unable to point to explicit examples, apart from housing, showing that such a marked deceleration currently is in train. Indeed, many of the reports that we get are quite upbeat.  For instance, one of our national temporary help contacts said his indicators were pointing to a bounceback from a weak second quarter, and he was seeing strong conversions from temporary to permanent status. One reason that some people were more pessimistic was that they believe the current expansion is a bit, as they say, long in the tooth, and so the economy must be due for a period of weakness. Of course, the economic literature finds that the probability of an expansion’s ending does not depend on the expansion’s current length.  However, these comments could reflect imbalances in the economy that increase exposure to adverse shocks.  But except for housing, any references to such imbalances are vague at best.  Although it is not certain, the mixture of reports may simply be indicative of the normal process of the economy’s moderating to growth averaging near or a bit below potential.  On the inflation front, we continue to hear reports of cost pass-through and other price increases similar to those we’ve received in recent months. Turning to the national outlook, although growth moderated in the second quarter, GDP growth for the first half was a solid 4 percent.  The unemployment rate remains below 5 percent, and the core PCE inflation rate has now been at or above 2 percent for more than two years.  It has to be said, in looking simply at the top-line data that form the basis of most Taylor rules, that real activity is pretty good and inflation is too high.  In this context, three related questions guided my thinking on the outlook.  First, are there important imbalances within particular sectors that should concern us?  Second, is the list of exogenous downside shocks accumulating to a point that the risks to growth outweigh those from deteriorating inflation?  Third, are the current financial conditions restrictive or not? Regarding sectoral imbalances, for some time we have assumed a marked slowdown in residential investment, but other sectors do not seem to be outside normal ranges of variation associated with an economy that is growing close to potential.  Business fixed investment last quarter was weaker than we had thought, but the weakness appeared to largely reflect transitory developments in volatile categories—communication equipment and transportation. Importantly, we don’t hear any stories of pulling back due to earlier overinvestment.  On the household side, the steady growth in the consumption of nondurables and services indicates that households do not seem to be overly concerned about their longer-term prospects for income growth. So for now, I do not see any sectoral imbalances that would pile on the housing adjustment and cause a more fundamental downshift in economic growth over the forecast period. What about shocks?  Well, the list of downside shocks is troublesome.  Energy prices continue to surprise us on the upside. Geopolitical risks have increased, particularly considering developments in the Middle East.  We now have some sense from businesses that animal spirits may be making them more cautious.  Currently, however, I think that this is more rhetoric than action. Still I think that all these factors deserve careful monitoring. Third, what about financial conditions?  When I was preparing for this meeting, I talked to no one who thought that conditions are restrictive.  The modal response continues to be that financing is readily available and is fueling a lot of dealmaking.  Ten-year Treasury rates are under 5 percent. Risk spreads are low. If we want to assess the constraining effects of past increases in the federal funds rate, we need to take into account the level of interest rates.  In all likelihood, the real funds rate has only recently reached neutral.  Furthermore, we need to consider the accommodation that we had put in place in 2003 and 2004.  The core PCE inflation data we now have for that period are about ½ percentage point higher than what we saw in the real-time initially announced inflation rates that guided our policy decisions back then.  So the unwelcome disinflation of 2003 was not as severe as we had feared at the time, and accordingly, our policy was more accommodative than we thought at the time, which may have had inflationary consequences. The incoming data make the current inflation situation seem much more troublesome.  First, as we all know, the latest reading on core PCE inflation is 2.4 percent. That’s pretty high. Second, the revised NIPA data indicate that core PCE inflation has been at or above 2 percent since April 2004, as President Poole mentioned.  The combination of these two facts makes me more concerned that inflation expectations may soon begin to drift up.  Finally, I don’t see the forces in play that would make the policy assumption in the Greenbook restrictive enough to put core inflation on a downward trajectory over the next 18 months.  If the pass- through was small on the way up, it seems likely to be small on the way down, and output gaps that might be emerging will not alter inflation’s trajectories very much or very quickly with flat estimates of Phillips curves."
"224";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Good morning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It’s a pleasure to be here today at my first meeting.  Many people around the table I’ve known for many, many years. Others I don’t know so well, but I’m looking forward to getting to know you better.  I realize that as the new kid on the block, so to speak, I have a lot to learn.  I’ve been on the job one week today, and that realization has been driven home to me in the past week quite amply by the fact that I’ve struggled to prepare for this meeting.  I have to confess that it did occur to me at a couple of points that maybe my start date should have been moved to August 15.  [Laughter] Maybe that was a failure of rational expectations or maybe just a simple forecast error—I’m not sure yet. Nonetheless, I really am honored to be here and to be a part of this group, and I’m looking forward to working with all of you. Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand at a moderate pace, albeit somewhat more slowly than earlier in the year.  Of course, this was in line with expectations in previous reports by Bill Stone to you.  Regional manufacturing activity expanded in July.  Our business outlook survey’s index of general activity fell to 6 in July, down from 13 in June, and the indexes of new orders and shipments also softened.  But the levels of these indicators continue to point to expansion in terms of manufacturing in the region and manufacturers’ expectations of future activity. Conditions in our construction sector are similar to what other people have been reporting. Nonresidential construction continues to strengthen in our District.  Bankers are reporting increased strength in commercial real estate lending.  Office vacancy rates have been edging down, and rents have been moving up. Our business contacts expect those trends to continue. In contrast, as in much of the nation, residential construction and home sales are down. Residential mortgage lending has slowed considerably, although home equity lending has been quite strong. Realtors report that the inventory of homes for sale is at the highest level they’ve seen in a number of years; they also report that prices are higher than they were last year, but the rate of appreciation tends to be softening. Thus far the slowing in the region’s residential housing sector seems to have been an orderly one. Retailers report a firming of sales in general merchandise in June and July, with sales at stores specializing in high-end merchandise being stronger than those at the lower end. Manufacturers’ incentives have helped boost auto sales in July in the region, but dealers tell us that inventories remain above their desired levels. Payroll employment in our three states has been expanding at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole, but that’s not atypical of the region.  The unemployment rate has edged down. In June, it was 4.7 percent. In most of the District’s labor markets, unemployment is lower now than it was a year ago.  Our business contacts continue to report difficulty in filling positions.  There has been some relief this summer with the influx of college students, but that cushion is about to end. It has been particularly hard in the District for firms to fill professional and managerial positions.  Firms have received a good number of applications, but many of the applicants are unqualified. Consequently, salaries for these positions have risen more than others. Our manufacturers report that recent wage increases in the region are higher than they were last year. This is consistent with the employment cost index, which shows stronger compensation growth in the Northeast than in other parts of the nation.  On balance, the regional conditions and outlook continue to be positive.  The rate of expansion in the second half of the year is likely to be somewhat slower than in the first half; but, again, that was expected. I’m more concerned about signs of continued and growing price pressures in the District. Consumer prices appear to be rising at a faster pace in the Philadelphia region than in the nation as a whole. One factor contributing to the faster pace has been the increase in housing costs in metropolitan Philadelphia, but that may prove to be temporary as housing prices stabilize. Nonetheless, broad-based cost pressures persist in most sectors of the region.  The indexes of both prices paid and prices received in our manufacturing survey have increased in July, and both are at very high levels. Business contacts say that price pressures continue to be one of their major concerns. I would characterize the national economy in a somewhat similar way.  That is, right now I tend to be more concerned about inflation than I am about growth.  I don’t view the second-quarter slowdown as necessarily a precursor to a significant weakening of the economy going forward. The below-trend growth in the second quarter was widely anticipated, and averaging over the first two quarters, as several people have done, output still grew at over 4 percent in the first two quarters.  The slowdown in residential investment was expected, and much of the slowdown in consumer spending was due to auto sales, which are volatile and which had grown very strongly in the first quarter and considerably less in the second. One surprise, however, did occur in the second-quarter numbers.  We expected business investment in equipment and software to slow last quarter from its very robust pace in the first quarter, but we didn’t expect an outright decline.  About half that swing, it turns out, reflects the timing of business purchases, particularly of transportation and autos, so the weakness in investment may be more about timing than it is about trend.  Indeed, as has been pointed out, corporate profits remain high, and capacity utilization rates remain high, and these data continue to point to the underlying strength in business investment. The July employment numbers released on Friday did little to change my view of the economy.  Employment continues to grow at a reasonable pace, although somewhat slower than earlier in the year. In July, employment in the private sector expanded at its fastest pace since March. Although the number was not large, the trend was at least mildly encouraging. Employment based on the household survey fell.  The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percent, but household employment has been volatile.  The decline of 34,000 jobs in July followed a gain of 387,000 jobs in the household survey in June.  If we abstract from the month-to-month volatility in these numbers, the unemployment rate remains low for the first half of the year at about 4.7 percent. At this point, I believe the economic indicators are consistent with sustained real growth near trend, as many people have suggested.  The benchmark GDP revisions suggest that trend might be a tad lower than we thought, but nonetheless I think the risks to growth seem at least roughly balanced. The inflation picture, however, has not improved.  Despite a slowing economy, price increases have been accelerating. The increases have been broadly based, as has been pointed out by Bill Poole and others.  They are no longer confined to energy and other commodities. Indeed, in June the CPI rose less than did the CPI excluding energy.  Core inflation is above the range I consider to be consistent with price stability, and to my mind, inflation risks remain tilted to the upside. The Greenbook’s baseline forecast has core inflation decelerating over the next year, but the staff has been marking up its forecasted path of inflation over time as the acceleration in inflation has persisted.  Even with the projected deceleration, the baseline forecast has core PCE inflation remaining above 2 percent through 2007. Given this persistence in inflation, unacceptably high inflation seems likely to be around for a while. A year ago I wouldn’t have said that.  In fact, I was in the camp that thought it was mostly a relative price phenomenon, but that position has become less compelling to me over the past year. The benchmark revisions to the GDP report show that both compensation per hour and unit labor costs have been trending up, not down as earlier data suggested.  Energy-price increases have not abated, suggesting that we are likely to see continued pass-through to core inflation, perhaps for some time.  Although the Committee has brought the fed funds rate up appreciably from historically low levels, real interest rates to my mind are not high.  I don’t view monetary policy as particularly restrictive at this point.  Thus, I have to put some weight on the Greenbook’s alternative scenario of persistently high inflation, and that leads to particularly poor outcomes.  Even if I accept the baseline forecast as my point forecast, the fact that inflation remains at a level above the range consistent with price stability for a considerable period is troubling. I am comforted by the fact that medium- and longer-term inflation expectations have remained relatively stable despite the acceleration in inflation.  That’s a testament to the credibility of the Fed in the marketplace—that it will keep inflation low. But how reasonable is it to think that inflation expectations will remain unchanged?  By allowing inflation to remain at a high level for a time—we are, after all, as several people have pointed out, in the third year of core inflation running above 2 percent—do we risk sending the message that we are willing to tolerate higher inflation?  If so, will expectations adjust accordingly?  As the model simulations of optimal policy paths and outcomes in chart 7 of the Bluebook indicate, it’s very costly to get inflation back down once it has been above our objective, particularly if expectations are allowed to increase. I believe that monetary policy has an important role to play in ensuring that the recent high inflation readings do not raise longer-term inflation expectations.  Thank you."
"225";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to offer just a few anecdotes, starting with Wal-Mart.  At the beginning of the year, Wal-Mart’s plan for same-store sales was for growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, but growth has run persistently below that since Easter.  July came in at 2.6 percent.  They had expected a range of 1 to 3 percent.  However, I think we have to be a little careful in interpreting July data in general because it was unusually hot over much of the country, and Wal-Mart says that they particularly sold a lot of what they call “hot weather goods,” like air conditioners and fans. My contact says that higher-priced items with higher margins are generally doing better than the lower-priced goods.  He is still seeing pressures on the lower-income shoppers at Wal-Mart.  Food inflation is actually coming down a bit:  It is now below 1 percent. My contact observed that suppliers seem to have paused in taking price increases, but he’s not sure whether that’s just part of a cycle during the year.  He also noted that the rate of price deflation is also less than it was for a number of items—particularly apparel and standard electronics items—that have been deflating for quite a number of years.  Those prices are still declining but not as rapidly as before. I had two readings from the transportation industry suggesting that July was surprisingly weak. UPS Express volume in July came in 3 percent to 4 percent below plan, and a large trucking company said that the July truck volume was flat year over year and the weakness was pretty much spread over all parts of the country, although more pronounced in the upper Midwest. It seems to be broadly based in terms of product category.  He said that in the trucking industry, or at least in his firm, they are increasingly nervous about recession. UPS noted that there is potential for disruption.  Their pilots’ union is currently in a ratification vote, which is supposed to be complete by September 1.  There’s a great deal of opposition within the union and some genuine possibility that the contract will be voted down, with associated job actions and disruption of various sorts.   My FedEx contact said he really had nothing new, and he didn’t even want to talk about that.  [Laughter] Let me make a comment about the national economy.  I want to talk about it in terms of the risks we face and to use a Phillips curve diagram as a device.  We’ll center the axes on the Greenbook forecast. One of the quadrants here has higher growth and lower inflation than forecast. I think we’re not very likely to be in that quadrant—it’s not impossible, but I don’t think it’s probable. So let’s talk about the other three quadrants.  One of them has good growth and higher inflation. We could end up in that quadrant, and that would just mean that we’re going to have the problem of dealing with the inflation over the longer haul even though our immediate future might not have a growth complication.  Quite frankly, I think we’re most likely going to be dealing with one of the other two quadrants.  One of them has lower growth with declining inflation.  I think the inflation pressures are pretty persistent and sustained, so I think we’re actually most likely going to end up in the very unfortunate quadrant where we have sustained inflation pressures running at the Greenbook forecast rate or above and growth running at that rate or lower. That situation is going to be very uncomfortable for us, but we’re going to have to be ready to deal with it. Thank you."
"226";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As has been observed, growth moderated in the second quarter largely as anticipated. The economy is perhaps returning to a sustainable pace of growth—one, I would add, that may be above the Greenbook forecast for next year.  As I thought about the Greenbook, much of it seemed plausible to me; but our VAR models provide somewhat more rapid growth next year.  When I step back and think about various components of aggregate demand, it seems to me that we might get a bit more out of business investment in equipment and software and net exports, and I think the supply side of the economy is sufficiently flexible to accommodate that. With regard to inflation and its prospects, little has changed from the last meeting in my opinion, and I doubt much will change in the near term, or at least not much will change for the better in the near term.  This suggests to me that we should be prepared to see core inflation running on a year-over-year basis near or above 2½ percent for several more months, perhaps several more quarters.  I haven’t heard anything from the business people with whom I’ve been in contact that suggests that a moderation of inflation is at hand or that aggregate demand, demand for goods and services, is slowing in an unanticipated way, except for what is turning out to be a pretty mediocre tourism season in our District. One distinctly positive development—and I think Charlie just referred to this—has been the stability of inflation expectations in the face of incoming information on inflation that might have led to some upward revision in those expectations.  The fact that expectations have remained well anchored so far is something that looks positive to me. Overall, as I try to assess the risks, it seems to me that the near-term inflation risks are tilted to the upside even though I continue to expect core inflation to ease back down in the longer term.  As for the risks associated with growth, I think here uncertainty has increased. However, against the background of the latest Greenbook forecast, I think maybe the risks to growth are also tilted to the upside. Only I wouldn’t use the term “risks”—I would consider that to be a positive development if in fact it occurred."
"227";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Treasury markets have convinced themselves in recent days and weeks of the prospects of lower growth, lower rates, and some degree of comfort with inflation, and they seem to have lurched to that on a somewhat accelerated basis in the past several weeks. But with some degree of humility, I’ll say I’m not quite as convinced as they are. I suspect that they may lose some of their conviction if some of the data that we’ve all talked about this morning around this table come to pass.  So we need to be keen in looking at inflation expectations, at the shape of the curve, and at the prices of some of these Treasury securities to evaluate the market reaction to what we do. I have just a couple of other general comments.  We’ll have readings on inflation soon, but I’m not persuaded that we will have a good view of how persistent inflation will likely be.  I suspect it will continue to trend to the upside and will beg those markets for a further review of the state of inflation expectations.  Similarly, I am not sure we’re going to have definitive views on growth.  I had a lot of discussions with a whole host of folks in the consumer and business sectors.  They are hearing, much as we are, top-down estimates for lower growth in the second half, but their own bottom-up analysis doesn’t seem to be bearing that out even here in the second quarter.  The only thing I’d note at the outset from the BEA revisions is that, though growth has come down somewhat over the historical period, quarter-over-quarter variance seems to be at least as pronounced as it was in the original dataset; so the data are likely to be rather volatile, I would suspect, as we look through the forecast period. With that in mind, I thought I’d take a couple of minutes looking at growth in the consumer and business sectors and then spend a few moments on inflation.  With respect to the consumer sector, I am probably more convinced at this meeting than even before that great tumult is going on below the surface.  In discussions with some of the big credit card processors, I asked them to tell me what they’re seeing.  They’re seeing huge changes in categories of purchases and even in the types of purchases if we exclude energy and gas products.  In sum, however, consumer spending looked quite strong to most of them through June and, importantly, through the first month of the third quarter. Although they had talked to their boards about lower volume in the second half, they have yet to see it in much of their data across a range of lower-income Americans as well as Americans with higher net worth.  They’re not seeing much softness at all.  The other piece coming out of those discussions is that they had expected to see a ramp-up in delinquencies—again, with much vaunted news of a slowing housing sector, higher energy prices, and a slower second half— and they have not. The news about delinquencies continues to be very encouraging going into the third quarter. It also raises the question of whether or not we’re going to see an inflection point. With all the discussions about the slower second half, we would have expected that personal consumption would have shown some more-meaningful effect than the data suggest.  So I’m not persuaded that several meetings from now we’re going to have this “aha” moment and that we’re going to see this inflection point.  On the growth front, I still have the view that growth continues to be above the Greenbook projection.  But I am more concerned, of course, about inflation. I have just a couple of other points of interest on the consumer front.  The July index of consumer sentiment does not suggest much of a slowdown in consumer confidence, and when I looked at the surveys since our last meeting, I came to a couple of conclusions.  When the surveys ask questions such as “How are you doing?” and “What is your personal financial condition?” the numbers tend to go in a rather positive direction.  “I’m doing pretty well, not great” is the answer, if you cut through the data.  When the surveys ask other questions such as “How is your neighbor doing? or “What is the state of the economy or the state of business conditions?” the answer we’re getting is, “Well, my neighbor is having all sorts of troubles.”  If we’re trying to judge the economy by what folks know best of all, I guess I don’t see much of a reason to expect that some of the worst-case scenarios will come to pass. Federal tax receipts, which I mention at most of our meetings, for July showed year-over­ year growth of about 13 percent.  The gains in wages and salaries implied by these increased tax collections finally make some more sense in light of the recasting of the official data from last week’s revisions, with real wages and salaries having risen 3.4 percent over the past year, which is about a six-year high. Turning now to the business sector, I put myself as probably as confident as most around the table on the state of this sector, though I have heard some talk of a diminution in “animal spirits.” But if you look at the data, you see that, as discussed this morning, the ratio of profits to GDP is at a record high.  Momentum continues to be quite strong, with credit spreads low, acceleration in business sales, and low ratios of inventories to sales; all these factors seem to speak to some underlying strength. The manufacturing sector, despite some noisy data on jobs and employment, appears to be in an incredibly strong position.  The ISM manufacturing index, PMI, and industrial production, which advanced at an annual rate of about 6.6 percent during the second quarter, are all very positive indicators about the manufacturing sector.  We also continue both to hear anecdotes and to see data about real pricing power in that sector, which is good news on the growth front and probably gives us a couple of questions on the inflation front. Finally, Dino referred at the outset to some of the bottom-up analyst estimates for profits in the second quarter and the second half, and I said a couple of meetings ago that we should really take note of these to see whether they flatten out.  They appear to be possibly flattening out a touch, but you have to do quite a bit of work to get there.  Second-quarter profits will end up above 15 percent once the S&P companies all report.  Some lower earnings guidance is being given over the forecast period; but throughout that period, earnings would still be up 11 percent or so compared with similar quarters last year—all of which is quite encouraging and comes as surprisingly positive news to boards of directors of these companies, who had heard about the slowdown but aren’t seeing it so dramatically. One area about which I spoke earlier was the capital expenditure number in the second quarter.  President Plosser probably summarized the point well in explaining that we should probably look through that number because of some volatile transportation-related orders. Moreover, when I look at the second half of this year and at 2007, other data on unfilled orders appear very positive.  Pent-up demand for cap-ex should be higher, given that the past three years had growth rates of 6.4 percent rather than the 8.3 percent that we had earlier anticipated.  The only other thing I would note about cap-ex is that there seems to be greater dispersion by industry and by sector. Technology and telecom do seem to be more disciplined in this cap-ex wave than maybe many of us, including myself, would have anticipated.  I suspect that, with continued talk about the slowdown in the second half, spending on tech and telecom will be bumpy and may drag some of the aggregate cap-ex numbers down substantially.  As I look at the business sector, I find myself asking the key question of whether this industrial economy, as robust as I think it is, will boost labor demand and personal income.  I suspect the answer to that question is “yes”; but again, it’s hard to be too definitive at this point. On the inflation front, I share the views expressed by most folks around the table of some degree of calmness and pleasure about the stability of inflation expectations.  But when I think about what has happened to the bond market, particularly in the past couple of weeks, and the rather robust moves that the bond market made at the end of last week, I could be easily persuaded that those inflation expectations will move against us as data come in between this meeting and the next. I would probably describe many of these inflation expectations as relatively calm; but if I had to guess, I’d say that they’re probably a bit more wobbly than we would like. Further on the bad news front, and I think President Fisher and President Poole made reference to this, no matter how we slice some of the core PCE data and some of the CPI data, even if we look at things like non-energy services, the trend is not our friend on a three-month or six-month average.  Most of us would not expect it to be our friend over the next six months. Again, the question is how persistent the trend is, and I have genuine concerns on that front.  As the inflation data are likely to deteriorate, we obviously have to look at a broad range of GDP outcomes for the balance of 2006.  In particular, I took note of the Greenbook’s simulation of persistent inflation to a 3 percent core, which I would consider a genuine risk, and although the Greenbook simulation suggests that the fed funds rate would need to go only to 5.9 percent, I’m probably more concerned that we might have more work to do if that series of events came to pass. Finally, let me quickly note the labor compensation front.  I believe that many of the gains shown on that front have been quite surprising on the upside.  They have been good news for most workers over the past couple of years, and they help explain that conundrum, which we’ve heard as each of us have sat before this table and been asked on Capitol Hill:  How is it that productivity is so remarkably high and compensation so remarkably low?  Have the gains to trade and to capital and labor changed?  I think these data suggest that they haven’t.  If, in fact, we do see continued acceleration in compensation gains—even, as the Greenbook suggests, to 5½ percent—I suspect the markets again will look to that and will take it at face value that those gains are likely to be more inflationary than many of us around the table believe.  I think that’s another concern. On balance, I’d summarize my own position as being considerably more concerned about the inflation picture than about the growth picture.  As Vice Chairman Geithner said, there are confidence intervals around all of these that are hard for us to bang the table in support of.  The work that we have from this meeting to the next will become particularly important.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"228";"MR. WILCOX.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just very briefly, these data came in, in most respects, pretty close to our expectation.  I would note that the productivity figures for the second quarter are built on the output data that were incorporated in last week’s advance GDP number.  We expect nonfarm business productivity in the second quarter to be revised up.  Based on information available today, it would be revised up 0.8 percentage point, to 1.9 percent.  Probably because of some fluctuations in hours, the productivity number in Q1 is 0.3 percentage point stronger than we had expected.  In Q2, it’s 0.3 percentage point weaker.  On balance, the profile there looks much as we had expected.  Compensation per hour is 0.5 percentage point stronger in Q1 than we had projected and right on our Greenbook projection in Q2."
"229";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think our decision today is going to be a close call because of the recent information we’ve gotten both on inflation and on the growth of the economy.  We know that, as President Poole and others have mentioned, wage and price inflation has been accelerating and is fairly broadly based.  The recent NIPA revisions also concern me because of the faster growth in core PCE prices that those data show.  The business surveys, in fact, show that companies feel they have more pricing power than they have had in the past. We know that we are going to have some continuing feed-through of the higher prices of oil. After talking to some folks in the oil industry, I am concerned about the recent Alaska situation. It clearly shows that maintenance of equipment and the efficiency of the operations of some of these companies may be under stress with the high volumes of capacity at which they have been running. We pray that it doesn’t extend much further in additional surprises. What also concerns me about the NIPA revisions are the changes in the productivity numbers.  The fact that with the NIPA revisions we are seeing lower productivity and faster- rising labor costs has implications for our forward expectations on inflation.  We also see that business investment in equipment and software was much lower.  That downward revision worries me because it implies that less capital deepening has occurred, and that would have been a strong base to support productivity going forward.  Now we apparently cannot rely on it as a base as much as we could before the revisions. In terms of the housing markets, the rapid escalation of home sale cancellations clearly has been very surprising. Again, the gross sales figures don’t show this, but the information we’ve got on the cancellations indicates a much more pronounced slowdown than we might have expected. In looking through other housing cycles and in talking to bankers and lenders, one of the good things I find is that the industry learned in the 1980s.  Because those in the industry are more sophisticated in the way they manage their land costs and their inventory, I think the length of the cycle is unlikely to be as long.  In the 1980s, bankers made plenty of funds available for companies to continue to develop land and to put in infrastructure.  When the housing bubble burst, all of a sudden we had unsold housing units.  They had to be sold before builders could start building on the developments that had already been laid out, and it took us several years to work through that. This time we don’t have the unfinished inventory of developments that we had in the ’80s.  So I think that the cycle is likely to be much shorter than it was then and that it will put some firmness in that market.  At the same time, this is the sector, aside from energy and commodities, that had a very rapid rise in prices, and it’s good that we’re seeing some correction in those prices right now. The other good trend that I take comfort in is the one that Dino mentioned earlier—that we’re seeing central banks around the world raising rates.  When we started raising our rates a couple of years ago, there weren’t too many moving at the same time we did.  We know that today monetary policy has global effects:  Excessive accommodation in some countries clearly can affect investments in other countries.  So I think we now have support in what we’re doing to remove accommodation.  We’re seeing that support more broadly across the world; and in the aggregate, then, it will help to moderate inflation in the period going forward.  Finally, I’m reminded that we do have long lags in monetary policy, and we still have to see the full impact of what we have already put in train. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"230";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data on the national economy have been slightly lower on the growth side and slightly higher on the side of continuing price escalation than at least we expected, and we have seen reflections of both these trends in the New England economy.  Overall, however, my sense is that growth for the region and the nation remains relatively solid but that price pressures are a concern. The region’s economy appears to continue to grow at a pace that will be sufficient to keep local unemployment levels in the fours.  The region has a slower pace of job growth than the nation, but total personal income is growing at about the same pace.  This suggests that per capita income growth is relatively solid, which is reflected in rising retail sales and state income tax collection. Indeed, local businesses continually comment on their inability to find skilled labor so that at least some of the region’s slow job growth may be attributable to supply rather than demand conditions. New England’s residential housing correction is becoming more evident and, by some measures, may be more significant than that for the nation as a whole.  Home sales were 4 percent to 5 percent off their 2005 highs in the first quarter.  That is similar to the nation, but the Case-Shiller-Weiss repeat-sales index sees, at least for Q1, the nation’s home-price escalation at about 10 percent year over year but Boston area prices up much less than that.  More-recent data from other surveys suggest that regional prices may be falling.  Inventories of homes for sale continue to grow, and the value of regional residential construction contracts fell more than 20 percent, compared with about 4½ percent for the nation.  This number likely reflects the relatively small amount of residential construction in the region, but the downturn is eye-catching anyway. Despite this, consumer confidence rebounded a bit from earlier this summer, and business contacts report relatively good performance. Now, one thread in my recent conversations with businesses is not dissimilar to what President Fisher just talked about. I found it a bit troubling that manufacturing and related business services appear to believe that they have greater pricing power than before.  They are talking less about increasing competition and less about efforts to increase productivity.  They seem to be less worried about margin squeezes and more confident that rising input costs, particularly those related to energy, can be passed on.  Some even report that strong demand has enabled them to raise prices or to avoid discounting even without major new input cost pressures. In general, there was a disquieting tone of greater tolerance for inflation. On the national scene, recent data on second-quarter growth, employment, and housing market trends seem to indicate a general softening of the economy.  This is not unexpected. All of us have been forecasting a gradual slowdown to potential or slightly below over ’06 and ’07 as the economy makes a transition from consumer-led to business-led growth and the saving rate climbs to a positive number. But has the evolving slowdown turned out to be a bigger soft patch than expected, or are we simply suffering through the ups and downs of the transition process?  I am not sure of the answer to that question.  I found the relatively low GDP and consumption figures for late ’06 and ’07 in the Greenbook forecast a bit disquieting, even after recognizing the effect of the benchmark revisions on potential GDP. Our forecast in Boston had been in sync with the Greenbook’s and on the low side of the range of forecasts around this table, but now we see growth of 0.6 to 0.7 percentage point above the Greenbook in ’07. We’re not projecting as large a hit to residential investment over the period, and we see solid disposable income offsetting high energy costs and lower housing wealth to a greater degree than does the Greenbook.  Moreover, although slow job growth is a concern, at full employment or beyond how much of this is a supply rather than a demand phenomenon, particularly when you take into account lower labor force participation? Are firms hesitant to hire because they are fearful of the future or because they can’t find the skills they need?  They certainly are not constrained by a lack of resources.  Thus, I am inclined to the view that, although things seem slower than we expected and the Greenbook forecast seems softer, not much has really changed since our last meeting.  Consumer spending has been relatively well maintained despite a weakness in Q2.  Spending for equipment and software appears to be in good shape.  And net exports, given growth abroad, will be positive at least for a time.  Residential investment is waning, but how fast is hard to say, and there well could be an offset to that from nonresidential investment.  Financial markets remain accommodative, and given the rise in inflation, real rates are down. What is a bit different is the fact that inflation is growing at a faster pace in the short run and is growing across most aspects of the core measure.  Certainly it is faster and broader based than I would like, and we continue to see leveling-off or falling price numbers only in the forecast. I recognize that will continue to be the case for some time even in the best of circumstances, but I am concerned that we may not face the best of circumstances.  Geopolitical events of all sorts and global demand continue to put pressure on input prices.  Productivity growth is likely slower, and economic activity may not wane enough to reduce resource pressures. As time goes by and outsized inflation growth continues, one can imagine a sense of inflation complacency growing.  In that regard, as I noted earlier, I found the regional anecdotes about making price increases stick of some concern. I should note here that my own board of directors in a telephone meeting just yesterday indicated concern about the ongoing strength of the economy and voted to maintain the current primary credit rate.  I myself worry about overdoing the tightening process, but as I told them, I don’t think we’re at risk of that at present.  Given the pace of inflation and given financial market activity, real rates have, in fact, gone down not up, leaving policy and overall financial conditions more accommodative than before our last increase.  In sum, I continue to be a bit less worried about variations in the cycle and more worried about the medium-term prospects for inflation."
"231";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook hasn’t changed very much since last spring, when I was contemplating the not-so-welcome cycle of slowdown in economic activity and some persistence in both headline and core inflation due to the lingering effects of large energy-price increases.  In fact, the Greenbook projections for real GDP now reflect something close to the pessimistic end of where I thought things could be heading.  The difference is that I have been thinking more of a cyclical slowdown and not so much of a slowdown in demand and supply, as reflected in the Greenbook baseline.  The possibility that slack might not be widening as economic growth moves down puts the recent inflation numbers in a particularly bad light. I have been especially concerned about how broadly based the inflationary pressures appear to be. When you take energy components out of the CPI and you look at the median that Richard was referring to earlier, about 67 percent of the expenditure-weighted items in the CPI increased at an annual rate of 3 percent or more in June, which is about the same share that we have seen since March. As Richard mentioned, the PCE statistics yield basically the same results. In Procter & Gamble’s most recent earnings report, the company attributed its good earnings performance partly to the ability to pass on higher costs through to product prices, and I am hearing similar remarks about pricing power from our directors and District business contacts. Although my business contacts have been reporting some ability to pass on price increases now at the retail level, where in the past they were saying that it was very difficult to go beyond intermediate goods, they’re not so sure that they will get more than one-time catch-up adjustments.  Most of my business contacts have not expressed concerns about an elevation in the long-term inflation trend. Nevertheless, I think there are clearly reasons to be worried about the risk of inflationary pressures intensifying over the balance of the projection period.  I also think that there is a risk that we’re not going to see as much slack as is embedded in the Greenbook baseline.  As in many other parts of the country, activity in the housing sector is slowing in the Midwest, particularly in the Fourth District, and the housing situation in the Fourth District could never be characterized as bubbly or frothy. Some of the veteran Realtors in my District with whom I have been talking are saying that this housing market is the worst that they can recall.  Comments like these, although they are selected, do suggest some more uncertain prospects for the housing sector.  My directors and business contacts have also been sounding a bit more cautious about the outlook for their sales, but at the same time their capital spending plans appear to be intact.  They remain vocal about the ability to get productivity gains, and they remain disciplined about their hiring plans. So as I contemplate the weaker spending track that’s forecast in the Greenbook, I’m inclined to attribute more of it to the demand side of the economy than to the supply side.  That is, I am expecting the Greenbook’s call for moderation in economic growth to result in a little more slack than appears in the Greenbook’s baseline. In a qualitative sense, my outlook carries lower inflationary pressure than the Greenbook baseline and thus is similar in spirit to the “lower NAIRU” alternative scenario.  Separating the cyclical and structural performance of the economy, of course, is a real challenge, and it is natural, I think, to feel unsure about the real-time estimates and projection of slack.  If the slower growth of potential output in the Greenbook baseline is accurate, it raises the possibility that the equilibrium real interest rate may be lower than it was in the last half of the 1990s.  In summary, Mr. Chairman, I still think there are risks to both of our objectives.  Thank you."
"232";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So far the economy has stuck pretty close to the script of the soft landing sketched out in the June Greenbook.  Real GDP growth slowed markedly in the second quarter.  Housing construction has declined sharply, and house prices have decelerated; this situation suggests that our policy actions have taken hold in this interest-sensitive sector.  The recent sharp rise in oil prices should also put a damper on growth of real income and consumer spending.  Most forecasters now expect below-trend growth in the current quarter. Nonfarm payroll employment has shifted down to a more-sustainable pace, and the unemployment rate has risen to 4.8 percent, just a bit below standard estimates of the NAIRU. Core inflation, although uncomfortably high, came in 0.2 percentage point below the June Greenbook’s forecast in the second quarter.  In addition, despite further large increases in the price of oil, inflation expectations held firm.  In light of these developments, a reasonable forecast is for growth to continue to run slightly below its potential rate, the unemployment rate to edge up, and core inflation to recede gradually. At our last meeting, I laid out some of my concerns about downside risks to the outlook for growth and upside risks to inflation. Quite honestly, I cannot say that the recent data have done much to assuage my angst on either account.  The recent falloff in housing activity and the deceleration in house prices have been faster than expected.  The current Greenbook has residential investment falling at an annual rate of 14 percent in the second half of this year, nearly twice as fast as projected in June. These surprises intensify the risk of a sharper slowdown as the lagged effects of our past policy actions come fully into effect.  For example, the housing slowdown could become an unwelcome housing slump as envisioned in one of the Greenbook alternative scenarios. A large homebuilder in our District summarized the views of many of our contacts when he recently commented that “the housing market has not yet popped, but a hissing sound is now clearly audible.” [Laughter] He pointed to rapidly rising cancellations as a particularly ominous sign.  I will be watching the incoming data closely for signs as to whether the housing slowdown remains orderly as hoped or takes a steeper downward slide, posing a greater risk to the economy. My concerns about inflation have also been somewhat heightened by the recent data or, more precisely, revisions to past data. Core measures of inflation continue to be well above my comfort zone. Of course, after the experience of last year, when core inflation was revised up by a considerable amount, I approached this year’s annual NIPA revision with some considerable trepidation. I was relieved to see that the core PCE price inflation data came out of the revision relatively unscathed, revised up just 0.1 percentage point for 2005; but other aspects of the report were somewhat less reassuring for the inflation outlook.  First, the rate of labor productivity growth over the past three years has been a bit slower than we thought, primarily because of downward revisions to the rate of capital accumulation, so that the Greenbook now projects structural productivity growth of 2.7 percent, about ¼ percentage point slower than we thought back in June. This revision suggests somewhat less downward pressure on inflation emanating from cost reductions and, therefore, greater upside risks to inflation. But that wasn’t the only surprise tucked away in the annual revision.  The upward revision to compensation growth over the past four quarters implies that growth in unit labor costs over the past year has been more rapid than we had believed.  I had thought that there was a good chance that compensation per hour and unit labor costs would increase relatively moderately going forward, helping to contain inflationary pressures.  The data revision was thus a bit of a wake-up call for me, and I have revised upward my views on the outlook for compensation and unit labor costs.  My reading of the report is that the revised data provide a clearer and less sanguine picture of the trend in this measure of compensation.  However, the employment cost index was in line with expectations in June and continues to show moderate growth. Moreover, even with revisions to productivity and compensation, the markup in the nonfarm business sector remains very high by historical standards, suggesting that firms do have room to absorb costs. Overall, I view the inflation outlook as highly uncertain, with a pronounced upside risk. As I mentioned at the last meeting, we just don’t have a good handle on why core inflation has risen of late or how persistent this rise will be.  While it is comforting to attribute the increase to energy and commodity-price pass-through, empirical evidence suggests that pass-through effects have been quite modest since the mid-1980s.  If so, the door is open for other explanations that may have a more lasting influence and require a more aggressive policy response. Something that makes me even more uncertain about the inflation outlook is that standard backward-looking Phillips curve models of inflation appear to be breaking down.  It has been widely noted that the estimated effect of resource utilization on inflation in such models has become much smaller over time.  But equally striking is the finding that the sum of coefficients on lagged inflation when freely estimated appears to have fallen as well, suggesting that inflation has become far less persistent.  In fact, our staff finds that, in looking over the past ten years, it is better to assume that core inflation will return to its sample average over the next four quarters than that it will remain in its recent range or follow a standard Phillips curve model. Interestingly, this decline in the persistence of core inflation has occurred at roughly the same time that long-run inflation expectations, as measured by the Survey of Professional Forecasters, appear to have become well anchored, and this may not be a coincidence.  Economic models with forward-looking inflation expectations tell us that, if the central bank has credibility and holds to a fixed long-run inflation target, then inflation will be less persistent than is implied by the standard backward-looking Phillips curve model.  Indeed, the puzzle for macroeconomists has been why we see so much inflation persistence.  Perhaps we no longer do. If that is true, inflation may decline faster than the Greenbook expects. Admittedly, the past ten years form a relatively small sample from which to draw definitive conclusions.  But the inflation process may have changed in a fundamental way, and we should be open to that possibility. I would like to stress that this evidence and the analysis concern the simple correlations of the inflation data that are used for forecasting.  The evidence does not relate to structural relationships, and therefore it does not necessarily inform us about how our policy decisions affect the economy or about the best course for policy.  In summary, although my modal forecast is relatively benign, I remain very concerned about risks to both growth and inflation."
"233";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060808meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Growth has moderated, but the economy still seems, to us at least, likely to grow at a reasonably good pace over the forecast period, somewhere in the vicinity of 3 percent.  We expect core inflation to moderate gradually from current levels, declining to around 2 percent in ’07.  This forecast assumes that monetary policy follows a path fairly close to what’s in the market and in the Greenbook. The key difference between our view of the outlook and that of the Greenbook forecast is in the strength of demand growth relative to potential next year.  We have reduced a bit our estimate of potential and also of actual growth, but we still expect the economy to expand at a rate close to potential. This is a very favorable forecast, and we have to recognize, of course, that the economy is going through a set of extremely complicated transitions, including a large, adverse, sustained relative price shock of uncertain duration and a substantial adjustment in asset prices that is now concentrated in housing. Our capacity to anticipate the evolution of these forces and to assess their effect on growth and inflation is, of course, very limited.  The forces that now appear to be working on the economy still present the unpleasant combination of upside risk to inflation and downside risk to growth; but for the moment we believe that the former, the possibility that our forecast is too optimistic on inflation, remains the predominant risk. I have a few points on the growth outlook.  The economy has clearly slowed, and the composition of growth within the United States and here relative to the rest of the world has changed. These changes were inevitable, and if they continue to occur smoothly, they seem desirable and necessary.  As a share of aggregate demand within the United States, residential investment had to contract and consumption had to slow.  And U.S. domestic demand had to slow relative to domestic demand growth in the rest of the world.  The key issue we face is judging whether we have significantly more weakness ahead of us than we are now expecting. In our view, most signs at present point to fundamentally healthy economic conditions. The survey-based measures of confidence are holding up okay.  Real household income growth seems likely to be good going forward.  Businesses have the resources and the motivation to sustain fairly strong rates of investment growth.  Structural productivity growth, even post- revision, still seems strong.  Inventory levels remain relatively thin, and the tentativeness that characterized much of the expansion in terms of investment and hiring should be a source of some comfort.  Global demand is still quite strong, of course, and together these forces will offset part, but not all, of the weakness coming from the adjustment in housing and consumption growth. The principal risk to this outlook for growth lies in the possibility that households will slow consumption more sharply because of rising energy costs, higher interest rates, greater pessimism about future income gains, or the effect of the housing adjustment on perceived wealth. Financial markets are showing a little more concern about future growth, but not a lot. This concern is most evident in the greater inversion in the yield curve that has emerged at the one-year to two-year horizon. I think you can see in the market some moderation of exuberance in credit markets, but just a little.  Overall, the markets seem to reflect a reasonably favorable view of future growth prospects. On the inflation side, as I said, we expect core inflation to moderate, not quickly and not dramatically but by enough and soon enough to bring core PCE inflation down to just below 2 percent over the next 18 months.  The issue we face is not so much about the acceleration in core inflation that occurred in late 2003 and 2004.  After that acceleration, core inflation was sort of trendless, in the vicinity of 2 percent for much of the two-year period, until the past six months, when we saw this uptick. The real problem we face is assessing the extent to which the very recent acceleration in core inflation reflects transitory factors, such as the indirect effects of energy prices, and the extent to which it may reflect pressures from higher resource utilization and other things less benign and less transitory. Energy pass-through, of course, seems part of it, but probably not all of it. Shelter doesn’t account for all of it either.  This judgment is critical for us, and we need to be careful that we’re not assuming away the more uncomfortable explanation, such as a broader inflationary impulse or a rise in pricing power that could reflect increasing acceptance of higher inflation. How confident can we be that the pressures that have induced this rise in core inflation will moderate sufficiently to bring down the rate of increase in core PCE prices to the vicinity of 2 percent or below?  Reasonably confident, I think.  With the economy growing at or slightly below trend, with growth of unit labor costs peaking and decelerating a bit as the Greenbook forecast anticipates, with inflation expectations moderating at short horizons and pretty stable at longer-run horizons, with energy prices flattening out, and with the dollar falling only a little, this forecast seems reasonable.  But note the number of assumptions and conditions this forecast depends on. Also, the expected path for inflation implies only a very gradual moderation and a period of sustained inflation above what is presumed to be consistent with this central bank’s long-term preferences.  The risks of this forecast, as I said, still seem to lie on the upside.  It may be some time before we can be confident that the forces are in place to produce the necessary moderation. More generally, however, we face the very difficult consequential challenge of trying to figure out the longer-term consequences of having been in an exceptionally long period of exceptionally low real interest rates—both real short rates and forward rates—that were induced by monetary authorities here and around the world.   Real short rates now look as though they were perhaps lower relative to the estimates of equilibrium even than we thought.  Perhaps more remarkable was the low level of forward real rates during much of our tightening phase.  These financial conditions may have produced more inflation momentum than we thought, and this may be the case even though there is some reassurance in the stability of long-term expectations. Those expectations are substantially below the peak in ’04 at the long horizon. However, the rise in asset prices and residential investment and the leverage caused by this long period of very expansionary monetary policy may lead to a process of adjustment in asset prices that could be more sustained and more damaging in terms of confidence and of demand than we expect.  This risk is greater if we end up allowing more inflation than our forecast anticipates, for the required monetary policy response could induce an even sharper adjustment in risk premiums and asset prices.  This possibility argues for a lot of humility in judging the appropriateness of the present stance of monetary policy and what will be appropriate over time, and it argues mostly for having as much flexibility as we can going forward, emphasizing that the inflation risks remain the predominant concern of the Committee. Thank you."

For the benefit of our new member, the convention is that you raise one hand to be recognized and be put in the queue; if you have a comment or question, raise two hands for an intervention.  I’ve noticed that there have not been a lot of two-handed interventions, particularly on one-day meetings, when we don’t have much time.  It is perfectly sensible to take account of the time, and that is fine; but if you do have an important intervention, by all means, don’t hesitate.  We start with President Poole.,  Thank you.

Governor Mishkin.,  Thank you. Let me just summarize quickly what I heard around the table, and then I’d like to make some additional comments of my own on the economy.  The sense is that, on the real side, there’s a two-tier economy.  There’s the housing sector and maybe autos, and there’s everything else.  On housing, there’s agreement that a significant correction is occurring, but the views of the risks vary among participants.  In particular, some feel that this still could be a quite deep correction, and others say that the fundamentals, such as incomes, interest rates, and so on, will ultimately support housing.  With respect to the rest of the real economy, there were some mixed reports; but on the whole, people characterized it as a full employment economy.  We’re generally more optimistic than the Greenbook both for later this year and for 2007. In particular, people noted higher incomes and stock prices and lower oil prices, which should support consumption growth and business activity. At least for now, I heard only a few participants being particularly concerned about the possible knock-on effects of housing on consumption and investment.  The labor market remains solid, and as we’ve been noting for a number of meetings, attracting more highly skilled workers remains difficult. On inflation, some noted somewhat better intermeeting news, with the possible exception of the higher compensation data.  But a lot of uncertainty was expressed about where inflation will go, reflecting in part our incomplete knowledge of the determinants of inflation and also some mixed anecdotal evidence.  However, I hear very clearly a definite unhappiness with the level of core inflation and with the amount of time that is projected to return it to a level of less than 2 percent.  The principal concern is that our credibility will be damaged if inflation remains too high for too long. So I would summarize the discussion—I hope reasonably accurately—by saying that inflation remains the predominant risk but there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about the evolution of the economy in the next few quarters. Let me add a few comments to this—first about inflation and then about the real economy.  I do believe that the intermeeting news on inflation was more good than bad, particularly relative to the fact that inflation is a lagging indicator and that it would not have been incredibly surprising if we had gotten 0.3 readings the past two months.  I’ll talk first about some of the positive news, and then I’ll address some of the risks going forward. First, there is evidence that the momentum of inflation has reversed.  When I gave my speech on June 5, which many of you followed up on, I emphasized the three- and six-month rates of inflation as indicating that an acceleration, a rising inflation pattern, was occurring.  It now appears that the three-month rate of inflation peaked in May.  So, for example, in May, the core PCE was 3.06 on a three-month basis; in July, it was 2.24.  The market-based core PCE was 3.00 in May, and in July it was 2.11. The core CPI was a high 3.79 in May, and as of the last reading in August, it was 2.95. So in some sense the direction has turned, and the momentum has been broken, and I think that has been reflected in views in the marketplace. Now, there hasn’t been much discussion of the details of this inflation report, and I think it’s actually quite significant.  In particular, a very important factor in both the level and the change in inflation is owners’ equivalent rent (OER); we’ve discussed this issue before.  OER is 41 percent of core CPI and 19 percent of core PCE.  Although OER has been decelerating recently, it’s still at a three-month rate of 4.4 percent, relative to an annual rate of 2.66 percent in 2005. So that difference accounts for a great deal of the change between where we are today on a three-month basis versus where we were in 2005.  The good news is that OER and other measures of rent of shelter have been coming down more quickly than many outside economists expected but in line with what our staff more or less expected; indeed, the number was 3 percent for August. So if it just stayed there or came down a bit more, we would see better short-term numbers for inflation going forward. Other positive news on inflation obviously includes energy and commodity prices.  For energy the dominant factors are supply-side factors over which we have no control—hurricanes or the lack thereof and geopolitical factors.  But it’s also interesting that metals and some other commodities are off their peaks. That suggests to me that, at least on the margin, some prospect of slowing economic activity and rising interest rates around the world may have taken a bit of the pressure off the commodity prices. We also have had some indication since the last meeting that the economy will be slower than we thought.  Clearly, the news on autos and housing was in a negative direction, and granting the flatness of the Phillips curve, all else being equal, that will take some pressure off utilization and pricing power.  Finally, I would argue that expectations are, in fact, really quite well contained. Around this table, we’re getting used to talking about core inflation. The inflation that people see, of course, is headline inflation, and ultimately that should be our target as well. Over the past year or two, headline inflation has gone well above what we would consider reasonable levels, and yet TIPS indicators, survey indicators, and outside forecasters have not markedly changed their long-term inflation forecast.  So I take the credibility issue very seriously, but I don’t think that there is much evidence yet that our credibility has been seriously impaired. On the negative side, the main piece of news was the higher compensation in the first and second quarters. There is not yet much evidence that labor costs are affecting inflation.  We’ve already discussed the issues with the measurement of compensation per hour.  Let me just note that, if you look at the components of inflation that have moved the most, you get things like rent, airfares, used cars, and things of that sort.  You don’t see much movement in services, for example, which are more labor intensive.  So I don’t think that labor costs have yet infected the inflation rate; indeed, we know there’s a weak correlation between these labor cost measures and inflation. However, and let me be clear about this, I think that the key risk to our inflation forecast is that markets will be tighter, labor markets will be tighter, and wages will grow more quickly, and that will produce more inflation than we would like.  So I would summarize the inflation situation as having had some modest improvement, some encouragement, but I certainly agree with the general sentiment around the table that the level of core inflation is certainly too high. On the real side, we paused at the last meeting to observe the lagged effects on real activity of our previous interest rate moves.  The evidence suggests that, indeed, interest- sensitive sectors did worsen over the intermeeting period.  We saw the second significant markdown in a row by the Greenbook for housing, and we’ve seen autos decline as well.  To this point, I agree that the economy except for housing is reasonably strong and that there are factors supporting consumption particularly, going forward. So as we look forward, I think there are two issues.  The first is how severe the contraction in housing will be.  To be honest, we don’t really know.  We’re talking, again, about an asset price correction, and it’s difficult, in principle, to know how far that will adjust.  The second issue is how much spillover there will be from any housing correction to the rest of the economy.  I don’t have quite as much confidence as some people around the table that there will be no spillover effect.  Any spillover effect would be a lagged effect, and it remains to be seen how much effect there might be.  But I agree that the economy except for housing and autos is still pretty strong, and we do not yet see any significant spillover from housing. Please look at the figure that was distributed.2  I want to talk a bit about the risks in both directions as we think about policy.  Let me just describe the two panels to you and then draw a conclusion from them.  The top panel shows the four-quarter difference in the unemployment rate—that is, the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year minus the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of last year, going back to about 1950.  The blue bars show recession periods. The dashed line is at zero, and the solid horizontal line is at 0.3 percentage point.  What you see is that, without exception, every time since 1950 that the unemployment rate has risen as much as 0.3 percentage point over a year, it has continued to rise, and we’ve seen a recession. That suggests that having unemployment rise just a few tenths and keeping it there is not quite so easy as our linear models might suggest.  In the bottom panel, you see four-quarter changes in the growth of real GDP. The dotted line shows zero, and the solid line arbitrarily shows 2 percent real growth. Again, these are four-quarter differences.  With the minor exception of 1956, again in no case was real GDP growth below 2 percent sustained for four quarters without an NBER recession.  I think a very interesting case is 1995-96—the famous soft landing that was engineered in the mid-1990s.  You’ll notice the line just touches the 2 percent zone without crossing it. [Laughter] 2 The figure to which Chairman Bernanke refers is appended to this transcript (appendix 2). So what am I saying here?  I’m only saying that, if we believe that we need to have output below potential to help arrest inflation pressures, it is a delicate operation, and we may have a very narrow channel to navigate as we go forward.  We should pay very close attention to how the economy is evolving at this particular moment because I think the uncertainty and the potential nonlinearity at this juncture are greater than what we normally face.  I’ll stop there, and we can begin our second round. Oh, I’m sorry—Vincent.  [Laughter]"
"235";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, the Eleventh District economy remains strong and continues to grow at a stronger pace than the rest of the country, with employment growth continuing at roughly twice the nation’s pace.  Incidentally, home sales have not turned down in our District, so we haven’t been singing yet what we call the “coastal blues” as far as the homebuilding market is concerned. I think that’s enough said about Texas and the Eleventh District. I would like to talk about what I have learned this time from my usual soundings of some two dozen CEOs and CFOs.  I have added a new one, by the way—the largest truck dealer in the country, which does $2.8 billion in sales of heavy trucks.  Just as a footnote, what is driving some of what President Poole reported are the changes in emission standards that are being enforced as of January; other than that, they do not see much turndown in volume. To summarize the reports of these interlocutors, I am going to borrow from Mark Twain’s great quip about the music of Wagner.  According to these business contacts, the outlook for economic growth is better than it sounds, whereas the dynamic of inflation is worse than it sounds. Just a few anecdotes here for, if not similitude, verisimilitude.  By the way, all the interlocutors are fully aware of the shape of the yield curve—these individuals are sophisticated— and they are especially aware of what is happening in the housing market.  As one CEO told me, the only subject that has been more analyzed than the housing situation is the birth of Brad Pitt’s baby. [Laughter]  According to this view, if we have not discounted what has been happening in the housing market, we have been living on Mars, and I think that is an important point to take into account.  If you remember, Dave, I have been more pessimistic than the staff in terms of the depth of the housing downturn. Well, very quickly, according to the CFO of Frito-Lay, he and his counterpart CFOs in consumer goods companies do not see an appreciable slowing of growth from the second quarter to the third quarter.  The CFO of UPS reports that, while business is tougher, third-quarter growth is running at a rate of 3 percent, the same as the second quarter, and their business projections indicate GDP growth “in the high 2 percent or low 3 percent area” for the rest of the year.  The CEO of Burlington Northern Santa Fe reports that, despite a 17 percent year-over-year falloff in lumber shipments through last week, business overall “has actually firmed since the second quarter.”  From my usual report on the Panamax shipping charter rates, it is noteworthy that since our last meeting, when the round-trip booking rate was $23,000 a day, the rate has soared to $31,000 a day.  By the way, the rates for carrying back finished products like steel from China, in the so-called handymax fleet, has risen to $27,300 from $23,000 a day, where it was at our last meeting. All the retailers I talked to—from 7-Eleven to JCPenney to Costco to Home Depot—report that they feel that they have bottomed out and that things are picking up, with one exception.  That exception is Wal-Mart, and I think some of that situation relates to the internal dynamics of the way Wal-Mart is positioning itself in the market.  I think Bill’s report was very accurate on Wal-Mart. There are some tempering contra-indicators.  The book-to-bill ratio for Texas Instruments and other semiconductor firms has fallen to 1 or slightly below, and advanced bookings for airlines are somewhat weaker.  Herb Kelleher of Southwest Airlines, who has to be the most entertaining interlocutor I talk to, tempered that by saying when we met last time the advanced booking curve “index” was, say, 100.  It has now eased to somewhere around 95—a noticeable but not dramatic drop. The CEO of EDS summarized the growth side of the economy much as did the majority of the CEOs I spoke to for this go-round when he said, “We were all expecting things to be worse. They haven’t gotten worse.”   They were all expecting things to get tougher, and they haven’t gotten tougher, except for one area—the procurement of labor.  There is a shortage of bank tellers and mechanics. By the way, a wrench bender, as they call the job in California now—a simple mechanic without the completion of a high-school diploma—gets $100,000 a year.  There is a shortage of truck drivers, of oil field hands, of chemical engineers, and even of unskilled workers such as retail store cashiers in Houston; and for the first time I have heard from the major hoteliers of a shortage of hotel maids.  To illustrate the point, one CEO mentioned that, whereas his company regularly used to get 300 applications for 100 truck driver jobs, they now get 3.  So the bottom line is that our contacts are feeling more optimistic than the economists’ forecasts.  They are worried about some constraints on domestic labor.  As one contact said, the economy feels like a full employment economy. I want to spend just a minute on the inflation picture.  I’m not going to go through anecdotes from the CEOs, though it pains me greatly as the son of an Australian to note that Anheuser-Busch has told its retailers that it is going to raise the price of beer 3 percent starting in January 2007.  But I do want to explain why our board voted 7 to 1 to raise the discount rate.  As you know, we measure inflation at the Dallas Fed by the trimmed mean.  Our numbers show trimmed mean inflation running at 3.1 percent in July and a twelve-month rate of 2.7 percent and, not unimportantly, with 57 percent of the component elements increased at a rate of 3 percent or more.  Now, of course, we cannot update those numbers until the next PCE number comes out, so you might argue that they are very stale.  But the recent CPI release was not comforting.  Dave, you mentioned 0.2 percent. Taking that at face value, you can say that consumer inflation is unchanged from July.  But if you really look at those numbers, the rate for July was 0.19 percent, and the rate for August was 0.24 percent.  If you annualize those numbers, that is a difference between 2.36 percent and 2.9 percent. So we need to keep in mind that the August CPI reading is about midway between July’s low reading and the elevated readings over the previous four months.  At an annual rate of roughly 3 percent, it is better than earlier this year, but it is still uncomfortable.  I take President Moskow’s point about our credibility, particularly against the background of the trimmed mean, Cleveland’s median rate of 3.4 percent, and then our six-month trimmed mean rate running at about 2.9 percent, I believe.  I mention this simply to urge the Committee that—not only in our deeds, to take President Moskow’s point, but also in our words—we need to continue engendering confidence about inflation expectations and be very careful in the way we state ourselves.  We cannot take it for granted that inflation has been completely conquered.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   That was the UPS estimate, yes, sir.,   Mr. Chairman, if I may, again, this is just one source of data.  They happen to be in a business that is, I think, particularly interesting.  In preparation for the last meeting, they were talking about a number closer to 3 percent than the original estimate before the revision, and they proved to be quite accurate.  But I want to make sure I was clear.  The CFO was saying that their third quarter is running at a 3 percent growth rate—the same as the second quarter in their business—and their estimate for GDP growth in the fourth quarter is in the high twos or low threes."
"236";"MR. GUYNN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since this is my last meeting, I want to say formally what an honor it has been to serve under your leadership, at least for a short while, and under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership before that.  And to my colleagues around the table and around the room, I want to say what an extraordinary experience it has been to work with you not only on policymaking but also on the other System business for so many years.  There is a lot that I will miss, and your friendship is at the top of the list. I will be mercifully short with my comments this morning.  At our last meeting, I indicated that the data from around our District had finally begun to reflect the anecdotal reports of slowing that we’ve been getting for some months.  The most recent data underscore that trend, but with some crosscurrents that suggest that some sectors continue to be reasonably solid. With a total of forty-four directors in the six offices in our Atlanta District, we have an unusually large complement of regular month-to-month contacts who can often signal a significant shift in sentiment about what may lie ahead.  Sometime ago we began to ask our directors each month to give us not only their views on specific economic issues but also their overall sense of the economic outlook.  Very simply, we asked them to indicate whether they think six months out that growth will be stronger, about the same, or weaker.  Over the past six months we have watched the aggregation of those views deteriorate to the point that, in our tabulation last week, the only directors who expected things six months out to be better were from New Orleans, where economic conditions can only get better. Some of the uneasiness about the outlook in our region clearly reflects the sharp housing adjustment that we’ve seen, particularly in our once-hot coastal markets.  That painful adjustment continues, with folks in the industry saying that they think the bottom may be as much as a year away. I talked just yesterday afternoon, before I left to come to Washington, with the CEO of one of the large national homebuilders headquartered in Atlanta.  Mr. Chairman, I think he was in the group that came to see you and others just a few weeks ago.  He emphasized that the adjustment that’s going on is broader and more significant than the data suggest. He said that sales cancellation rates, even in cities like Atlanta, now exceed 50 percent, whereas they had been running about 30 percent.  He underscored something that we have talked about before, and it has been mentioned again this morning, that the fall in the real selling price is often masked by incentives and give-backs that have become very widespread.  He said the only exception to the adjustment in housing that he could see was in the major Texas markets. The stories out of New Orleans continue to be depressing, with business leaders now saying it may be a decade, rather than a few years, before the housing crisis there can be substantially resolved. There are simply not enough habitable housing units to accommodate the workers, especially low-skilled hospitality industry workers who are needed by businesses that are trying desperately to reopen and to get back on their feet.  As a consequence, more and more jobs are being moved out to other cities, and many of them are not expected to return. As I mentioned at the outset, there are also more-encouraging crosscurrents in our region. Manufacturing activity still looks reasonably solid; transportation and tourism do as well.  We had some good employment gains in all our states last month, after some disappointing data the month before. We continue to get reports of shortages of skilled labor in a number of trades, including the construction industry.  Despite continuing input price pressures, which others have talked about, we’re told that the ability to pass along those costs in final goods and services is still very limited for many businesses. As far as the national economy is concerned, it’s my view that we’re about where we expected to be at this point, with no huge surprises since our last meeting.  Evidence of slowing is now more apparent, but many crosscurrents also exist at the national level.  Corporate profits are high, investment spending still seems to be reasonably strong, and consumer spending remains supportive of growth.  While many sectors continue to perform reasonably well, as my regional remarks suggest, considerable uncertainty does exist about housing, both in terms of how steep the slowdown will be and what the slowdown might mean for consumer spending. Although energy prices have clearly fallen back, inflation, as everyone has said, remains above our preferred range. We’ve had some encouraging monthly inflation data since our last meeting, but the hoped-for moderation in prices that we expected to see is still mostly a forecast. Still, I take some encouragement from the fact that the forecast for lower inflation readings over the period ahead is not only reflected in the Greenbook but also in the modeling work my own staff has done and in the projections of outside forecasters.  Additionally, modest inflation expectations seem to be holding.  And markets are not expecting us to deviate from our current policy stance, at least for the short run. Finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to say to you and others that I’m counting on all of you to protect the buying power of my hard-earned retirement savings.  [Laughter] I’m going to have lots more time as a retiree to be a Fed watcher and a letter writer, and I promise to be in touch if you don’t do a good job. [Laughter] Thank you very much."
"237";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Mr. Chairman, I’d characterize the Tenth District’s economy as quite healthy right now. As you know, the Tenth District has benefited perhaps disproportionately from the rise in energy prices over the past few years, and this is providing considerable stimulus to the local and state economies in the District.  We are also seeing strong manufacturing activity driven by exports of District products.  Although the housing markets across the District can be characterized as soft, we have no reports of serious declines in prices anywhere in the region. Retail sales, excluding autos, also are holding up pretty well for us.  The other soft spot for us is agriculture, and that is tied pretty much to the drought that we continue to experience. Regarding the national economy, the economic information received since the last meeting confirms a further slowing of economic activity this quarter.  Moreover, weakness in housing and auto production suggests that the fourth quarter could be a little bit weaker as well. At the same time, we have recently experienced the sizable and largely unexpected declines in energy prices that we have talked about here, which, if maintained, could provide some stimulus over the balance of the year to offset some of that weaker information.  Currently, I expect growth to slow to a range of 2 percent to 2½ percent in the second half of the year and to rebound to above 2½ percent or to 3 percent next year.  Generally speaking, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook, especially with regard to housing and consumer spending, and I’m not nearly as pessimistic as the Greenbook on potential output. As to housing, we are in fact, as all have noted, squeezing out of that sector the speculative excesses that developed with the low interest rates of recent years—and doing so is unavoidable if we want to correct the sector. The adjustment process has obviously been painful for some, and it has not yet run its course.  However, we perhaps see ourselves getting a little closer to the bottom than we might think right now, and that’s related to the fact that credit remains available at reasonable rates for most homebuyers, as suggested by the recent information on mortgage applications.  So, yes, it is painful, and yes, we are going through it; but I don’t think it is necessarily long lasting in terms of the consumer’s position. For the consumer more generally, the situation is obviously mixed.  On the one hand, consumption will likely receive less stimulus going forward from the withdrawal of home equity, and with slower house-price appreciation, wealth effects will likely be lower as well.  On the other hand, higher labor compensation and lower energy bills should provide support to the consumer in terms of confidence and the ability to spend.  Overall, I continue to believe that there are somewhat more downside risks than upside risks to the outlook over the next quarters, but I think we are moving in a fairly consistent way as far as GDP growth goes. Finally, let me provide my perspective on the inflation outlook.  My overall views on inflation have not changed materially since the last meeting.  I continue to expect core PCE inflation to moderate from about 2.3 percent this year to 2.1 percent next year on the course we have right now. The big negative on inflation, of course, is the higher trajectory for labor costs, which has been mentioned.  Although the recent revisions to compensation are perhaps somewhat unsettling, such concerns are partly offset by the recent more-favorable monthly inflation numbers and by the significant fall in the prices of oil, gasoline, and natural gas in recent weeks.  Although the recent inflation data have not caused me to alter my inflation outlook, I am in one sense more confident in the forecast of moderation than I was a month ago or so. On balance, as we look at all this, I agree that we still have some upside risks to inflation that we have to remain aware of as we look to the policy discussion ahead.  Thank you."
"238";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Growth recession.,  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Whatever you want to call me is fine. [Laughter] I’m just glad to be here.  [Laughter]  I don’t think I can follow that up. Given the initial conditions—the doubling and more of energy prices over the past two years, the overexuberant housing market coming to grips with a renormalization of interest rates, a very low personal saving rate, and an uncomfortable increase in inflation this spring—a period of modestly below-trend growth and gradually ebbing inflation, as in the Greenbook forecast, is about as good an outcome as we can expect, as Dave Stockton noted.  In that regard, several developments over the intermeeting period have made me a bit more comfortable with the plausibility of such an outlook. The weakness in housing has deepened and is more definitively leading to growth of output below potential.  In fact, in my view the behavior of the housing market constitutes the main downside risk to sustained moderate economic growth.  We’re in the middle of a housing adjustment, which has been hard to forecast, especially because it involves the unwinding of an unknown amount of speculative demand.  With inventories rising and reports of price cuts getting greater prominence, the market isn’t yet showing signs of clearing and stabilizing.  In the Greenbook forecast, residential investment, though weak, is supported by continued growth of income and relatively low mortgage rates, while house prices basically level out in nominal terms.  As the Greenbook notes, however, this forecast leaves some aspects of the existing disequilibrium intact, most notably the high level of prices relative to rents.  Also, the cutback in construction doesn’t completely offset the apparent excess building of the boom period.  As a consequence, I see the housing forecast in the Greenbook as very far from the worst-case scenario that President Minehan characterized it as.  And, we are just beginning to see the effect of the downshift in house-price inflation on consumption starting to play out. Outside of housing, however, recent developments should help to sustain continued economic expansion.  Financial conditions remain quite supportive of both business and household spending. Long-term interest rates have fallen appreciably since midyear, and they are low in both real and nominal terms.  Risk spreads are narrow, banks have not pulled back on business credit, and equity prices have risen on balance in recent months.  Lenders and investors appear to remain confident that the economy will continue to expand at a decent pace. Higher levels of labor income in the first half of the year, along with a favorable effect on disposable income of a decline in energy prices, will help support consumer spending going forward. Economies elsewhere seem to be expanding at a solid clip.  Moreover, they are probably less vulnerable to spillovers from a housing-led slowdown of growth in the United States than they were to weakness in 2001. That weakness was centered in a global market for investment goods and was reflected in global declines in equity prices. The less robust economy should present businesses with a more competitive environment in which it will be harder to pass through cost increases.  In addition, the decline in energy prices, along with the leveling out of other commodity prices, will reduce cost pressures on businesses and should feed through in some measure to lower core inflation, especially as slower growth damps pricing power. The drop in energy prices has already restrained inflation expectations a bit.  For all these reasons, I’m also a little more comfortable with the forecast of gradually ebbing core inflation. Nonetheless, I still see significant upside risk to such a path for inflation.  In part, this reflects my uncertainty as to the reasons for the rise in inflation this spring and summer.  Feed- through of energy and other commodity prices must have contributed to some extent, and we can see evidence of this in the greater price increases for some of the more energy-intensive sectors, such as for airfares. A portion of the pickup is in the rent-of-shelter category, likely from a shift to rental housing as expectations of house-price appreciation have been scaled back.  But price increases have picked up in a number of other categories, and although energy costs probably accounted for some of this acceleration, we can’t dismiss the possibility that other forces were at work—for example, more general pressure of demand on potential output. A reduction of those types of pressures is still only a forecast. On the cost side, as many have commented, the compensation and unit labor cost data, while flawed in many respects, could be pointing to a risk that higher labor costs will persist, putting pressure on prices that might only be partially and reluctantly absorbed by profit margins. In sum, Mr. Chairman, I’m a bit more comfortable with something like the path for the economy and inflation in the Greenbook forecast, but uncertainties are quite high.  They might even justify the “higher than usual” description.  The downward path for inflation remains at risk, and as others have noted, the costs of exceeding that path could be disproportionate.  Thank you."
"239";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you very much.  Unfortunately, I think we find ourselves in an uncomfortable position like that of six weeks ago, with a continuing mix of inflationary pressures and decelerating economic growth at the same time.  I think the fundamentals are in place for a continued moderation of growth but not a contraction, much as the Greenbook describes. Obviously, housing is a risk that everyone has talked about.  But the key, as many people have also mentioned, is maintaining contained inflation expectations, and that comes down to thinking about whether some of the factors that we’ve been seeing have been more transitory or more persistent. Let me first talk about growth and go through the C plus I plus G plus net exports.  I would agree with the staff’s characterization that world economic growth is not quite as strong as some others have put forward.  I don’t think we’re going to be seeing an enormous export boom. Also, as briefly mentioned, I see very little on the government stimulus side.  Tax revenues, as Governor Warsh mentioned, were very high.  Spending is being kept relatively tight.  On investment, we’re seeing some strength in capital spending.  My concern is, if consumption goes as low as the Greenbook suggests, what the return on this capital spending will be.  Is it going into the right areas?  I was a little concerned when President Poole mentioned that the air freight company is expanding rapidly but the on-the-ground delivery company is not expanding at all. So are they going to have to invest in parachutes to get these in?  [Laughter]  But that is precisely the concern that I have—that capital spending may not conform perfectly to what consumption demand is going to be.  We certainly saw this in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  I’m just a bit worried about that now, especially given the potential tension between slowing consumption and robust investment growth. Now, regarding consumption—we’ve talked about the potential support from lower energy prices and some positive wealth effect from stronger equity markets, but obviously housing is one key here. It’s a key partially in overall investment but also in the uncertainty that it causes in consumers’ minds.  Housing is one of the worst areas for data.  It’s very difficult for us to have any concept of what prices are doing because it’s not a market like any other.  We do have the Case-Schiller index, and we do have some better indexes that people are now betting on, but they’re still very poor indicators of prices relative to the indicators we have in other markets.  We also know that there can be queues and that extras can be thrown in, so there’s a lot of uncertainty with respect to where prices are going.  That concerns me quite a bit because I think we just don’t have a good handle on it. Permits and starts have continued to come down from where they were at our last meeting and are now at levels of the beginning of 2003 or even starting to slip into 2002. If they flatten out there, the housing sector is still historically reasonably good. But there’s no indication that we’re necessarily at a turning point and that things are going to flatten out. There is the wealth effect, the direct effect on people’s consumption behavior of lower wealth going forward, and also the confidence effect.  We don’t have a perfect analogy with the previous times in which we’ve seen these housing downturns— we have a different context in that the economy is broadly more robust—and so I think it’s less likely that we’re going to see a major housing problem.  But I think it is a real risk, and we have to be sensitive to it. On the inflation outlook, we have to come back to transitory versus more-persistent components, as many people have mentioned in the discussion.  Obviously, people are heartened that energy prices have come down, but I certainly would not put the same bet on the energy markets that one trader did in a hedge fund that got into a little trouble recently because we know that energy prices can move in ways we don’t expect.  So I don’t want to take too much from that. I think it’s appropriate in the Greenbook to use the market’s expectations.  What measure do we have other than market expectations? If we did have a better measure, then we’d be running one of those hedge funds. However, there’s a lot of uncertainty around that measure.  So I certainly don’t want to bet on better inflation going forward just because we’ve suddenly seen a 15 percent decline in oil prices over the past six weeks.  That said, it’s heartening that energy prices are unlikely to lead to greater inflationary pressures going forward than those when we paused six weeks ago. The rise in compensation is obviously troublesome—not if you are an employee receiving the higher compensation, but from our point of view.  However, a lot of tension is in those data because we have the compensation numbers versus the ECI.  There’s a big statistical discrepancy between gross domestic income and gross domestic product.  It’s possible that some of the increase in compensation will be revised away, and we’ll see actually higher productivity growth. We just don’t know, and it may be a while before we see it.  Also, as we discussed a lot last time but not this time, the continuing fairly wide margins that businesses are experiencing may come under more pressure and may absorb some of the increases in labor compensation. How much is uncertain, but that may be one potential offset. As many people have said, we can’t become complacent.  Inflation expectations have behaved reasonably well since we paused at the last meeting, which is heartening in that the markets believe that inflation is reasonably under control in the near to medium term and even in the longer term.  It’s hard to find evidence of increases in inflation expectations, but as many people have said, that does not mean that we don’t have to worry.  We have to worry a lot because the key is keeping those expectations well contained.  I think we’re in a situation in which we can do that. Slowing growth is not going to give us more of a benefit.  The flatness of the Phillips curve, which people have talked about, is what the data have been over the past ten to fifteen years in the United States and most other countries.  So even if there is a bit more slowdown, we are not necessarily going to get the potential benefit in significantly lower inflation pressures—maybe a little but not very much.  So we still have to worry about the upside on inflation, and that’s why maintaining our credibility is of utmost importance.,  It’s called the hot seat. [Laughter]"
"240";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District’s economy has grown at a somewhat faster pace in recent weeks, reflecting a solid uptick in manufacturing.  Preliminary results from our September survey are showing increases in all manufacturing measures, with a particularly strong performance of shipments and new orders.  The six-months-ahead outlook measures are also coming in broadly stronger.  Growth in the District services sector continues at a moderate pace.  Retail sales remain somewhat sluggish, however, held down by soft big-ticket sales, which we understand were mainly in auto and building materials.  The residential real estate market shows signs of further cooling, especially in Maryland and Northern Virginia.  As has been the case for several months, however, real estate activity varies widely across the District, with the Carolinas, which were less affected by the boom, reporting continued strength. Labor market conditions remain taut, with job growth generally reported to be solid. Complaints that skilled workers are hard to find continue to be heard, and survey evidence suggests continued wage pressures.  Recent reports regarding District price pressures generally tilt toward the firm side on balance.  Early reports for September for the manufacturing sector show a notable acceleration in both current prices paid and current prices received and large increases in six-months-ahead expectations for both.  Reports on service-sector prices are more mixed.  Our respondents from the retail sector report moderation in current price trends but see more-rapid six-months-ahead price gains than they did last month.  Our other service-sector firms report no change in current price trends but expect some moderation in coming months. Regarding the national economy, since our last meeting we have received largely positive news pertaining to the outlook for consumer spending.  There was a sizable upward revision to the current level of labor income, which improves the outlook for real disposable income growth. Lower energy prices should provide an additional, though one-time, boost to consumer spending. So on net I find myself, again, a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on consumption. The housing data certainly have been weaker than anticipated, and I now expect a somewhat steeper decline, as does the Greenbook.  Forecasting this housing adjustment is particularly difficult because, as President Minehan pointed out, we have only one or two episodes for comparison in the post-Reg Q regime, and as David Wilcox pointed out, they don’t seem to closely resemble our current situation.  I find this Greenbook’s more pessimistic outlook for housing itself plausible, but I’m still fairly skeptical of large indirect spillover effects on employment or consumption.  For overall activity, I expect real GDP growth to be somewhat below trend, especially this quarter, but above the Greenbook through the end of next year. My views on the inflation situation have not changed much since our last meeting.  The lower reading on July’s core PCE was encouraging, and the easing of energy prices is clearly providing some relief on headline inflation.  However, July’s lower numbers were not particularly broad based, and the August CPI report shows a significant rebound in core inflation, as President Fisher noted.   While labor compensation numbers have been hard to interpret, they also appear to point in the direction of greater price pressures, which I take it to be the staff’s view. The downward movement in TIPS inflation compensation since the last meeting has been quite striking—more than 30 basis points at the five-year horizon.  I’ve made a lot of comments on TIPS inflation compensation spreads in past meetings, and it’s not clear that this downward movement signals much of an improvement in the outlook for core inflation in the near term.  I pointed out earlier that the Bluebook shows that the fall in near-term inflation compensation has occurred mainly at a three-month or four-month horizon.  Compensation for the period running from October/November this year to the same period next year has hardly fallen at all, and this to me suggests no significant change in the rate at which the public expects core inflation to moderate over the next year or two.  Moreover, one-year-forward expected inflation rates five and ten years out have not fallen much, so I do not view the recent fall in TIPS inflation compensation as terribly comforting.  Overall, regarding inflation, I’m quite apprehensive about waiting for core inflation to decline as slowly as it does in the Greenbook or about letting a new reduced-form model do our work for us."
"241";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I just should say that it’s a great pleasure to return to the Federal Reserve System—I have so many friends here at the table and around the table. It’s also very nice to move to a slightly more comfortable chair.  [Laughter],  Many of you know I have an upbeat personality—some might actually say loud—but certainly upbeat. The way I look at the forecast and the situation with the economy is quite positive in the sense that what we’re seeing, really, is a return to normalcy and a more balanced economy.  The excesses in the housing sector seem to be unwinding in an acceptable way, so I think it is quite reasonable in terms of the Greenbook forecast to think that the spillover here is not going to be a big problem because we’re actually moving resources from a sector that had too much going into it, into sectors that need to have more resources at the present time.  So in that sense, I’m actually quite positive.  The other thing that I am quite comfortable with in the Greenbook forecast—though, clearly, there’s uncertainty—is that we’re going to see a decelerating core inflation rate.  Furthermore, when we look at inflation expectations, they seem to be very well contained and seem also to have responded well to the pause at the last meeting. However, I should say that, although we’ve seen that inflation expectations are well anchored, there’s a question about whether they’re anchored at quite the right level.  They seem to be anchored somewhere around 2½ percent on the CPI, and that is probably with a differential between the CPI and the PCE of about ½ percentage point, or 50 basis points.  It still seems to be somewhat on the high side in terms of what many people on the Committee have expressed is their comfort zone.  So I think that is a concern.  There is a significant probability that things may not turn out so rosy on the output front—we should have a concern that things could go somewhat wrong in terms of the housing sector.  If that happened, we might see much lower output growth.  There is a reasonable probability of recession.  It’s mentioned in the Greenbook. I think your numbers are quite reasonable.  So in that context, we could actually have lower output, a wider output gap, and some actual deceleration of inflation.  I agreed very much with the conclusion that you came to because it’s reasonable to think that the long-run inflation we’re moving to is around 2 percent unless we get one of the scenarios with a lot more softness.  That the deceleration is not going to go much below the Greenbook forecast of around 2 percent by 2008 does cause me a bit of concern. I’m not sure that I would describe the risks as unbalanced.  For me, in terms of a forecast, probably I would be comfortable saying they’re balanced.  However, I think inflation is too high in the forecast and, in that context, does require much more vigilance.  Of course, that will be reflected in the discussion later today. Thank you."
"242";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My contact calls and director reports this round point to moderate growth in overall economic activity.  Both nationally and in our District, housing is weak.  Domestic auto production is slowing from last year, but activity in other sectors remains on a solid footing. Starting on the downside, one of our Detroit directors from Pulte Homes characterized the slowdown in housing as broad and deep, and he said that they face a rocky road for the next year or two. With regard to motor vehicles, GM noted that their lower production in the fourth quarter largely reflected the retooling of five plants for their new truck platform, reduced low-margin sales to rental fleets, and lowered desired inventory holdings by dealers because of higher interest rates. Both GM and Ford are trying to reduce their reliance on sales to rental fleets. In contrast, a wide array of capital goods manufacturers reported continued strong growth. The two major temporary help firms headquartered in the District pointed to modest but steady growth in billable hours.  Importantly, no contact was worried about a protracted slowdown in the economy. Indeed, my directors were quite optimistic.  This is an important change from six weeks ago, when we were hearing comments that the expansion had become long in the tooth and concerns that we were headed for a period of sustained weakness.  This more upbeat assessment was in line with the sentiments I heard at the International Manufacturing Technology Show, which was held in Chicago earlier this month with over 90,000 attendees from more than 100 countries. Now, I did not have a chance to talk to all of them, [laughter] but the ones I did talk to were quite optimistic about increasing demand for U.S.-made high-tech capital equipment.  The most amazing and impressive new technology that I saw was something that looked like a large ink-jet printer, but it spit out metal dust to fabricate intricate parts without traditional tools or dies. This was really quite unusual and impressive. Turning to inflation, there was little change in most reports regarding price pressures.  Labor compensation continued to increase at elevated rates.  Our contacts from temporary help firms noted a further step-up in wages for highly skilled workers, whereas our retail contact said he was paying 8 to 10 percent more for entry-level sales personnel.  Of course, the energy picture on the cost side looks better.  Several contacts expressed relief at the recent declines and hoped that they would lead to reductions in fuel surcharges and related costs. Turning to the national outlook, we agree with the Greenbook’s assessment that growth in the third quarter appears to be somewhat weaker than we anticipated at the time of the August meeting. However, in contrast to the Greenbook, we do not think the sluggishness will persist for long. Current financial conditions do not appear to be a restraint on activity.  Labor markets are in good shape, so growth in jobs and wages should continue to support household spending.  We are getting a welcome boost to real incomes from lower energy prices; and given the increase in business optimism that I noted earlier, I am less concerned that cautious animal spirits will cause businesses to pull back on spending.  Housing remains the major downside risk, but I get the impression that thus far the weakness in residential investment is not spilling over to the other sectors of the economy.  Of course, we have talked about this at great length. So our overall assessment is that by early next year growth will be much closer to potential than the Greenbook projects.  Accordingly, we do not think that any meaningful resource gaps will emerge to restrain inflation.  Indeed, our inflation models based on data since 1967 look for core PCE inflation to be 2.7 percent in ’07 and 2.6 percent in ’08.  The models that use data only since 1984 come out somewhat lower, at 2.4 in ’07 and 2.3 in ’08. In thinking about the differences between these forecasts, I found the background paper that Dave circulated quite useful, as several others have said.  Our models allow for permanent shocks to the level of inflation, and as the paper noted, such shocks appear to have been much smaller since 1984. But as also discussed in the paper, we have no way of knowing whether these permanent shocks will be small in the future.  I think the most likely interpretation of the reduction in the volatility of these permanent shocks is that policy has done a better job of anchoring inflation expectations. The public is more convinced than they were in the past that we will maintain low and stable inflation.  But if our actions fail to confirm this belief, we would lose credibility, leading to higher inflation expectations and imparting more persistence to the current inflation shock.  An inflation shock that is permanent rather than transitory is our responsibility. Our forecasts remind me of this risk.  True, so far this is just a risk.  We have not yet seen any broad-based increases in long-run inflation forecasts by private-sector economists or in the five-year to ten-year TIPS inflation compensation.  Indeed, TIPS have even moved down recently. This news is welcome.  But even if inflation expectations have not moved up, another concern is the level of long-run inflation expectations—and I thought Jeff Lacker raised a good point last time in reminding us about it.  Long-run inflation expectations of around 2½ percent for the CPI translate into a core PCE rate well above the middle of my comfort zone of 1 to 2 percent.  Even the Greenbook expects core PCE inflation to be above 2 percent through ’08.  I am concerned that even now the public could be questioning our resolve to bring inflation into what many of us have said is our comfort zone.  I am already hearing this sentiment from some market analysts.  Even without an increase in expectations, it is not clear to me that inflation will settle back to a level that I view as being consistent with price stability without further policy action.,  Yes, and Chrysler announced just yesterday that they, too, are reducing production in the second half.  What intrigued me about GM, which has lowered production plans, is the changeover for light trucks.  They are producing these trucks in five plants, and that is the largest number of plants that produce one type of vehicle.  As a result, when they change these plants, they do it sequentially; the changeover slows production in that plant.  Then they ramp up, and it takes some time to ramp up.  Then they go to the next plant and do the same thing.  So they are going through a series of five plants, and that in itself lowers their production in the fourth quarter.  The other things I mentioned would lower it as well."
"243";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Chairman Bernanke.  Overall, economic activity continues to expand in the Third District.  The consensus in the regional business community is for moderate growth in the months ahead, but some sentiment has turned more cautious in the intermeeting period. We have seen a slowdown in regional manufacturing activity over the past month.  Our business outlook survey, which remains confidential until noon tomorrow, weakened somewhat in September with general activity falling just barely into the negative area, at -0.4, from an 18.5 number in August.  This is the first negative reading we’ve seen since April 2003.  The diffusion indexes for shipments, new orders, and unfilled orders also turned slightly negative.  I don’t want to read too much into one survey.  The April 2003 dip was very short-lived, and we saw a similar pattern in our survey in the mid-1990s, when growth slowed but then picked back up again fairly quickly. Part of the slowdown in manufacturing is at firms that supply the housing industry, reflecting a slowdown in residential real estate, which has become more pronounced in our District since our last meeting. Building permits and home sales were down in July and August. Inventories of homes on the markets, like much of the nation, continue to increase.  House-price appreciation has slowed, but we have not yet seen outright declines.  Despite an increase in cancelled sales of new homes, builders generally indicate that their backlogs will keep them relatively busy through the rest of the year. However, some real estate contractors have begun to lay off employees in anticipation of slower activity. A pickup in activity in nonresidential real estate markets has been helping to offset the decline in residential construction.  Office vacancy rates continue to edge down, and net absorption of office space continues to be positive. However, over the next year, some moderation in nonresidential building construction in our three states is expected.  In response to a special question in our manufacturing survey this month, about one-third of the firms report that they plan to lower their expenditures on new structures next year compared with this year. Only one-tenth of our firms expect to raise spending on structures.  When we asked a similar question a year ago, about half the firms expected to raise their expenditures on structures in 2006, and, in fact, we did see that this year. For other categories of capital spending, however, firms by a large margin anticipate expenditures in ’07 to be the same as or higher than those in ’06. At some small banks in our District there has been a recent pickup in nonperforming loans, which is concentrated in their commercial real estate portfolios. Conditions in other sectors of our region are little changed since our last meeting.  Retail sales of general merchandise edged up, but sales of back-to-school merchandise, especially fall apparel, did not seem to meet manufacturers’ expectations.  Payroll employment continues to expand in our three states at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole, which is typical of the region. The unemployment rate, which had edged down slightly in June, edged back up in July but remains below 5 percent.  While many employers continue to report difficulties in filling positions, the Philadelphia staff’s forecast is for employment in our region to grow at a pace of about 1 percent over the next year, slightly lower than this year. Unemployment rates in the region are expected to increase modestly maybe over the next year. Growth continues at a moderate pace, but we see little indication of receding price pressures in the District. The index of prices received in our manufacturing survey edged up in September.  There was some minor moderation in prices paid, but that index remains at an extremely high level.  Employers in a number of industries in the region report that wage and salary levels have been moving up at a somewhat faster pace than they did a year ago. Turning to the national economy, my view is not much different than it was at our last meeting.  My main concern remains the outlook for inflation and the risk it poses for our credibility. In my view, the Fed’s most important contribution to a healthy economy is achieving and maintaining price stability.  As expected, incoming data continue to indicate a moderation in growth to potential or somewhat below potential.  On the negative side, housing has weakened more sharply than many expected, and auto production seems to be turning down for the rest of the year. On the positive side, as has already been mentioned by a number of others, business investment and corporate profits remain firm.  Employment continues to rise at a moderate pace. The revised wage and salary data are now more consistent with the strength in consumer spending that we’ve seen, and continued growth in income and perhaps lower gas prices will help offset the possible negative effect that we may see from a deceleration in housing prices. On balance, I am somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook about the growth side of the economy.  I, too, see growth somewhat below potential over the next four quarters, but that’s driven predominantly by a slowdown in the near term—that is, in 2006.  Then I see a return to potential more or less in 2007, although my estimate of potential is probably slightly higher than the Greenbook’s estimate. Now, given the level of precision of our output measurements and forecast of potential GDP growth, I’m really not overly concerned about the forecast at this point.  The adjustment in the housing sector to more-sustainable levels is forecast to occur without triggering a recession and without triggering much of an increase in unemployment.  I believe we should not attempt to stand in the way of that happening.  It’s a mistake to think that the forecasted moderation in growth will bring inflation back to a level consistent with price stability.  Indeed, the Greenbook’s baseline forecast of core PCE inflation remains above 2 percent through the end of 2008. Even in the alternative Greenbook simulation of a slump in housing, in which aggregate demand weakens and real GDP growth slows to just 0.6 percent in 2006 and barely above 1 percent in the first half of 2007, core inflation hardly changes and remains above 2 percent in 2008. Thus, it seems to me that language from us in the press that indicates that moderating growth will help to restrain inflation is not really consistent with our forecast.  I think it imputes a degree of precision to an estimated Phillips curve that we just don’t have. Over the intermeeting period, we have had some hopeful news on the inflation front. Core CPI inflation has not accelerated further in the past two months, and oil prices seem to be down. Thus, headline inflation, as I pointed out, is likely to be way down in September, and we will seem quite omniscient.  The measure of expected inflation over the ten-year period in our Survey of Professional Forecasters has not changed—it remains at 2½ percent.  The August rise in the Michigan survey of one-year-ahead inflation expectations seems to have been reversed in the preliminary September numbers, largely because of the decline in oil prices.  However, both compensation per hour and unit labor costs have been trending up, not down as the earlier data suggested, although I will note that the usefulness of the compensation numbers in predicting inflation is quite weak. Although core inflation has stabilized, its level is still above our so-called comfort zone. To my mind, the inflation outlook is quite uncertain.  We do not yet know if the positive developments in oil prices will stick or not.  I hope they will, but certainly we’ve seen energy prices retreat only to move back up again, and the hurricane season isn’t over yet.  Thus, we should not become too sanguine about inflation from one or two data points.  Moreover, we do not know if the upward revision to labor compensation will pass through to core inflation, as built into the Greenbook baseline, or if measures of medium-term inflation expectations will continue to decrease. What we do know is that core inflation has been above 2 percent for two and a half years and is expected to be there, according to the forecast, for another two years.  Put another way, there is little evidence in the forecast that policy actions to date will bring core inflation back below 2 percent before sometime in 2009.  I think that should concern us. I see two inflation scenarios as being plausible, and I struggle with which one I believe to be the correct one.  In the first scenario, core inflation is elevated primarily because of transitory factors, like the pass-through of higher oil prices, and reflects an adjustment to these changes in relative prices.  As oil prices stabilize, assuming that they do, we’d expect to see core inflation presumably fall and fall faster than indicated in the baseline Greenbook forecast.  The Greenbook forecast appears to me to incorporate an assumption of relative price stickiness that is inconsistent with some recent studies on microdata.  Thus, in this scenario, I see inflation falling, perhaps more in line with the Greenbook’s alternative scenario of less persistent inflation.  This story is appealing and plausible to me, but it rests on the transitory nature of the current measures of inflation. Even in this most desirable of scenarios—seeing inflation fall back to 2 percent or slightly less in 2007—we have to recognize that we will have essentially ratified a higher price level driven by oil price increases, and we should ask ourselves whether or not we are comfortable with that. In the other scenario, stimulative monetary policy during the past five years has been a major contributor to the rise in core inflation.  In this case, we wouldn’t expect to see a deceleration of core inflation until monetary policy has firmed enough to take out the cumulative effects of that accommodation.  The Committee has now moved rates up considerably from historical levels. If potential growth is now lower, as the staff indicates, the equilibrium real rate may be slightly lower, suggesting that monetary policy may be slightly firmer now than previously thought. Even so, it has only recently reached that level.  But given the imprecision with which we estimate potential output or equilibrium real rates, I really don’t take much comfort from such measurements.  Thus, to my mind, there is a significant risk that policy is not yet firm enough to achieve the desired outcome. Regardless of which of these two scenarios you think more likely, I think we must be concerned that our credibility and the consequences of allowing inflation to remain above our comfort zone for so long are at question. If scenario 1 comes to pass and inflation falls faster than suggested by the Greenbook baseline, then we would all breathe easier.  But that scenario seems largely a bet on oil prices and on the presumption that past accommodative policy is not playing any role, and that makes me nervous.  I would much prefer to believe that scenario 1 is the operational one. However, again, I find it hard to believe that a four-year to five-year period is transitory, so I have to consider the alternative.  If the first scenario is wrong and inflation evolves as in scenario 2, then our credibility is seriously at risk if we fail to take further steps to curtail price increases. We might be lucky.  But we might risk finding ourselves in a situation in which inflation expectations become unhinged, making it more costly to bring inflation back down. As has been mentioned, in the Greenbook alternative forecast in which inflation expectations become unanchored, inflation remains near 3 percent with only a slight decline in 2008, and growth slows below 1¾ percent next year and remains well below trend through the forecast period. To me, 3 percent inflation and 1½ percent real growth is not a comfortable place to be and would make restraining inflation in the future even harder for us. I’d like to conclude my remarks by thanking the Board staff for their research on inflation dynamics and the possible reduction in the level of persistence in recent years.  I think this is an important area for research, but I encourage the staff to continue its work to try to identify structural models of these dynamics in addition to reduced-form models.  I agree with the staff that the monetary policy implications of the reduced-form findings presented in the memo depend on how one chooses to interpret them.  The results presented by the staff and others suggest that, since 1990, inflation has become less persistent and appears to be less related to other macro variables as well.  We do not know whether these changes are due to a more aggressive stance of monetary policy against inflation and to our credibility or to fundamental changes in the domestic or world economy.  If we suppose that lower inflation persistence is due to enhanced policy credibility, then it is incumbent upon this Committee to maintain that credibility. That is, we should not expect inflation persistence to remain low if the Fed acts in a manner that is inconsistent with its commitment to price stability or risks its credibility by neglecting to take actions that return the economy to price stability in a reasonable period of time.  We shouldn’t ignore the fact that the longer we allow deviations from price stability to persist, the higher is the risk to our credibility and the higher is the risk that recent high inflation readings will raise longer-term expectations, thereby putting us in a very awkward position a year from now.  Thank you."
"244";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to be quite brief.  My contacts in the transportation industry are giving off some very mixed signals.  UPS is investing heavily in capacity expansion.  They have a problem in expanding capacity because they traditionally do it by buying used passenger aircraft.  There are very few of these large aircraft around.  They are expecting a busy holiday season. My contact in the trucking industry says that his firm is now contracting.  They have canceled orders for heavy trucks, the rest of them for delivery this year, and I found these numbers quite interesting.  He gave me the heavy truck purchases; these are the big, over-the-road, heavy trucks. I will read you the numbers from 2003 through 2006: 2,825; 3,377; 2,424; and 2,672.  Their planned truck purchases for next year are 250, and they have canceled the orders for the rest of this year.  So the contraction is dramatic, and they have actually been reducing capacity. My Wal-Mart contact said that it’s a bit hard to read the most recent data.  They work entirely on a year-over-year basis.  Last year was heavily distorted by the hurricane season, and he said that the latest weekend was a bit disappointing.  The paycheck cycle that they look at to understand their customers’ liquidity situation is very muted, apparently with lower gasoline prices taking pressure off the budgets of many of their customers.  He said that, for the first time he can remember, they have dropped the construction of new stores; they’ve actually canceled seven or eight projects because of high construction cost increases, which have been running in the neighborhood of 15 percent year over year.  They are having no problem in finding labor, and he is not reporting any particularly great price pressures.  I had already commented earlier about my concern about what these employment numbers are going to mean, and so I won’t repeat that point. Thank you."
"245";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me make just two or three fairly general comments. First of all, I, too, want to compliment the staff for the paper on inflation dynamics. I think it was very well done. It is important, and we need to take it seriously, and I view it in some sense as a follow-up to some of the work that has been going on at some of the Reserve Banks in recent years. One of the things that I think is important about it is that, at a minimum, it ought to raise a yellow flag about our ability empirically to go from measures like output gaps, or the NAIRU, or other measures of capacity to the determination of inflation.  I don’t want to exaggerate that point. I know there are different ways of interpreting it, and I know the work isn’t definitive. But I do, nevertheless, think that we need to think about it seriously and consider it when we discuss the inflation outlook and its relation to economic performance. Second, with regard to the economic outlook, I indicated at the last meeting that I was somewhat more optimistic than the Greenbook, and that gap has opened up even further.  I am more optimistic, although I’m not talking about the current quarter.  One way of summarizing my position is that I think the positive effects of higher incomes, lower energy prices, higher equity values, and stable-to-declining interest rates are greater than you apparently do.  I say that even though I can readily imagine that the decline in housing activity turns out to be both more protracted and deeper than you forecast it to be. By the way, as a footnote, if I did the numbers right, back in 1965 and 1966, we did get a decline in aggregate housing starts of better than 20 percent without a recession, although 1966 was considered a mini-recession, or a pause, or something—I’ve forgotten what the exact term was.,  Yes, something like growth recession.  But the bottom line here is that it hasn’t been a good idea to underestimate or underrate the performance of the U.S. economy since late 1982. Finally, with regard to inflation, even if I’m right about the economic outlook and we get more growth, I don’t think that necessarily implies that we’ll have more inflation than is predicted in the Greenbook.  Having said that, I still think that core inflation at its current rate is of concern, as is the outlook that you portray.  Thanks."
"246";"MR. STOCKTON.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" It is still vague.,  I want to say something on the order of ¾ percentage point.  Just the revisions in the data are not too different from that."
"247";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d like to make four points, a couple of which have been stated by my colleagues this morning, and then spend a little time on each of them.  First, like many of you, I am more concerned about the upside risks to inflation than downside risks to output and employment.  Second, the markets responded quite positively to the last FOMC, so they’ve been going in the right direction.  The stock market has been up, the bond market has been up, energy and commodities are down, and TIPS inflation compensation measures are down.  Six months ago I would have taken some comfort from that; now, six months into being a central banker, I’m worried.  [Laughter] So I join the ranks of Jack and the rest of you who have been here a bit longer than I have.  Third, for the first time since I’ve been here, I’m a little less sanguine about the supply side of the economy in looking at the business base, the cap-ex base, and the manufacturing base.  But I find myself today probably more comfortable, or at least as comfortable as I’ve been, with the strength and resilience of consumer demand.  The fourth point I would like to spend a couple of minutes on is that I think we are at the beginning of a major test of market liquidity that’s happening in real time in the fixed-income markets.  So let me take each of those in turn. First, on the consumer side, consumer spending appears to be strong and resilient.  As was noted at the outset, there was a strong July PCE reading, on par with the strongest gains of the year, suggesting to me that consumer demand may actually be accelerating from the second quarter into the third quarter.  The Greenbook estimate of 3 percent PCE for the third quarter and 2.75 percent PCE for the fourth quarter may actually be understating the strength of the consumer, particularly with falling gas prices. I’m also comforted by income growth and labor market conditions, which I see as likely to be far more important to consumer spending than housing wealth.  Consumer income gains appear to be rising. I’ve made note previously of very strong tax receipts.  Although they’ve tapered off somewhat, they continue to be robust.  Tax receipts for the year are up about 12.4 percent. The past couple of months would suggest they are in the high single digits, and though there is some noise in those data, I do take some comfort from them.  Other recent corroboration of labor income, with the revised NIPA data and other measures, suggests that real wage and salary income again may be accelerating.  It has been noted this morning that stock options and bonus payments may have had an effect in the first quarter, creating a bit of noise in those data. However, they should also remind us of the wealth effect of equity gains, which may partially offset the negative wealth effect from housing, particularly with 100 million members of the investor class. I think that’s something that needs to be considered in our thinking about the strength of the consumer during the forecast period.  Finally, as I think Governor Bies noted, the labor markets remain reasonably tight.  Despite the softness in housing, unemployment insurance claims and unemployment rates remain quite encouraging. Turning for a moment to business, about which I am perhaps a little less optimistic than I’ve been before, industrial production is still reasonably strong but, perhaps disappointingly, has flattened for August, even though the July numbers appeared to be on an upward trend.  When I looked back over the past 24 monthly readings for 2004 and 2005, both of IP and retail sales, I found that each declined about six times, so I’m not sure that we’re seeing a new trend here.  My own sense of where IP is in September is that it’s remarkably strong, but, again, I have some caution that I didn’t have before. One other note—unlike the Greenbook, I sense that exports are likely to make a real, meaningful contribution to GDP during the forecast period. In terms of capital expenditure growth rates, another survey I’d like to mention is the Business Roundtable survey that came out a couple of days ago.  It was more negative on capital expenditures than it has ever been. I would say that the group has a mixed record in calling inflection points, but the survey results, nonetheless, suggest that only a little less than 40 percent expect increased cap-ex in the next six months, whereas about half said that cap-ex would remain constant over that period. Perhaps that’s an effort to protect margins with higher costs that could be only partially passed through. As I’ve noted before, earnings growth continues to meet or beat expectations, certainly through the second and third quarters, and my own sense is that fourth-quarter earnings will also be fine, probably still at the double-digit rates of about 10 or 11 percent.  Perhaps that explains some of the taking the foot off the accelerator in terms of capital expenditures. In terms of housing, to add a bit to the previous discussion, my own sense is that the residential sector may have, in fact, crowded out some nonresidential loans during the most recent boom and that nonresidential construction was marked up sharply in the second quarter, to an annual growth rate of 22 percent.  My sense is also that the market’s capital allocation function is working well. C&I loans are growing about 15 percent or more, perhaps the highest rate in the past 20 or 25 years, and we’ll probably see a little more capital allocation to this nonresidential sector. Whereas the Greenbook assumes a significant deceleration in this group, I think that there’s reason for some upside surprise.  As a result, I expect stronger GDP for the second half of ’06 than the Greenbook does. Turning to inflation, I think that inflation risks have not materially receded, though we’ve probably seen acceleration stopping.  That is, we’ve seen the top, but the new direction is not clear. One measure that I’ll look to over the next six weeks is what’s going on in the capital markets.  Since we last met, ten-year yields have probably moved down about 15 basis points, and the Greenbook reports that there should be a slowdown in business debt financing.  That statement of the Greenbook is probably reflected in the data that we’ve seen in July and August in terms of the capital markets.  But the test of liquidity to which I referred will be a big supply/demand test over the course of the next six or seven weeks.  Perhaps $150 billion in funding is coming to market from the bank loan market, the leveraged loan market, high yield and investment grade.  Admittedly, in that $150 billion number, which stacks up as a big number even compared with only a couple of years ago, when we would see financings over a year of $175 billion, there are some elephant deals, and they are probably distorting that number a bit. HCA is coming to market with a $20 billion deal, as well as a couple of other major leveraged buyouts. The liquidity in those capital markets appears to be incredibly robust at this moment; there are massive pipelines.  You hear words like “euphoria.”  I would say that the capital markets are probably more profitable and more robust at this moment, or at least going into the six-week opportunity, than they have perhaps ever been.  A significant variety of participants are playing. This is a function of huge sovereign debt inflows and of significant liability management by issuers—some of the CFOs to whom Governor Bies was speaking.  Investors at this moment appear to have very little leverage in terms of the pricing of these deals or in terms of some of the covenant protections that were referenced at an earlier meeting.  Previously, I had said that, particularly in the investment-grade market, we were seeing issuers hesitate to come to market because they didn’t want to negotiate their covenants away.  In the event that they were to be taken out by a leveraged-buyout player, they wouldn’t want to have a change-of-control premium.  Now that these markets are as robust as they are, those same brand-name issuers are coming back to the market, and at this point it seems as though they will likely get their pricing done. So, I do not yet have a final determination of what this pipeline looks like; but if all goes through, it will suggest to me that there has been rather massive liquidity during this period. Other measures of liquidity appear to be somewhat more encouraging from my perspective.  The commodities markets have been mentioned.  They’ve probably had some hot money come out of them, with a lot of retail investors, both directly and through pension funds, coming in too late and maybe exiting for good, as well as some very encouraging news about the TIPS markets, which were referenced previously. In sum, I would say that the markets seem to be very impressed by our letting the economy develop, particularly in the next couple of quarters, and I’m impressed by the market’s confidence in us. I think that it puts a significant responsibility on us and is probably the only way I can reconcile the rather robust gains in the equity markets and in the debt markets over this period. That is, the markets believe that somehow we’re going to manage to thread the needle and nail the perfect landing. There is, I think, increasingly a one-way bet in the bond markets in that they believe that there is a degree of accommodation and they have built in a degree of loosening in the forecast period, which we don’t have a proper understanding of.  Only a couple of months ago we were describing, and the Chairman described, an economy in transition and the very wide tails around that. We still have the wide tails, but the markets seem to think that we’re going to nail this landing. I think the minutes from the last meeting faithfully captured our concerns about the appreciable upside risks remaining.  Either the markets didn’t buy that description, or they were convinced that we were going to act with an incredibly deft touch to stop that inflation.  All in all, I would say that in the markets there is less dispersion of views than is probably healthy and less dispersion of views over these different scenarios than we found ourselves discussing some time ago.  So with that, I think we’ll have a more robust discussion in the next round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"248";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start my remarks today by reflecting on some results of the latest Duke University CFO survey.  This survey is only about six or seven years old, but the one that was just concluded on September 10 has CFOs’ optimism at the lowest levels in five years, and so it’s continuing to show an erosion of their confidence.  I found the CFOs’ number 1 worry—weak consumer demand—interesting because it wasn’t there before, and that uncertainty is part of what the CFOs are worrying about.  Their second biggest concern is rising labor costs, which they attribute primarily to the scarcity of labor.  They are anticipating that the scarcity is going to continue to drive labor costs higher.  In terms of their hiring plans, they are planning now to hire fewer people than they hired last quarter.  They are expecting to increase employment over the next twelve months 0.8 percent; last quarter’s survey showed 1.3 percent, so that’s quite a slowdown.  However, they’re going to increase outsourced employment 4.3 percent.  Thus what is showing up is the uncertainty—wanting to use an adjustable labor force to get the flexibility because of the uncertainty.  They are also trimming their capital spending plans over the next twelve months to 5.1 percent, compared with 7.5 percent last quarter. Thus the survey indicates that CFOs have growing concern; they are still optimistic overall, but I think that caution is there. Now, in looking at the numbers myself, I’m perhaps not quite as pessimistic.  Again, as several of you have said—and Dave commented in his remarks—except for housing, the economy really does look good.  As you know, I’ve been worried about the mortgage market and housing for quite a while. In an endeavor to find something good to say, I have noticed that, in the past couple of months, the Mortgage Bankers Association index of new loan applications for purchase mortgages looks as though it’s starting to level off.  Very often that could be a leading indicator, so that could be a positive sign. However, as some of you have remarked, there’s a lot of speculation in the housing markets that has to unwind. All the folks who bought housing for investment have to do something as they see housing prices slowing and the financing costs to carry their investments going up.  How that unwinding will occur, given the substantial size of the speculative positions in some markets, is something that will need very close monitoring.  I know that our supervisory staff is focusing on that, too. People are focusing on the fact that delinquency rates in mortgages still look good. However, we’ve seen a very rapid increase in debt service ratios since 2004.  I’m concerned, again, with the amount of adjustable-rate mortgages out there that will reprice in the months ahead. If, as we think, some of these loans, particularly subprime loans, were made mainly on the collateral value of the house and not on the affordability of the mortgage, we could see more distress in the borrowers’ markets coming forward.  If that’s the case, it could have spillover effects on consumer spending more broadly. On the positive side, payroll growth has been good in the past three months—128,000.  It has picked up a bit, and it is significantly above the Greenbook forecast, and that gives me some optimism.  It’s putting more income in people’s pockets to spend, and the unemployment rate has been stable. Hourly earnings, however, are rising faster.  While that acceleration can support consumer spending, it contributes to my concern about where we’re going in the long run on inflation. As I look at the Greenbook forecasts since May, we’ve been continuing to project more and more inflation going forward.  The private sector has basically been doing that in their forecasts as well. When I look at those forecasts, I’m concerned that for various reasons we have reduced our estimates of the trend rate of growth.  As we bring down the trend rate of growth— and I realize that, as several have said, we’re at the lower end of the private-sector growth forecasts—I worry about the disconnect.  Are we seeing a slowdown in potential that others aren’t? Or if we’re right that potential growth is lower and the private forecasters are right that real growth is going to be faster, then we could have more inflation pressures going forward.  For the first time, we are also looking at prices in 2008, and they continue to rise at over 2 percent. They’ve been over 2 percent for two years. I worry, from the standpoint of our credibility, about what having such a long period above 2 percent means.  So I believe we will see moderation of inflation, but I think it’s important to preserve our flexibility and be able to respond if these worst-case scenarios that I laid out become more troubling to us going forward."
"249";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  New England continues to grow modestly, though recent data suggest that some caution is warranted.  District employment growth remains slower than that of the nation.  Most states in the region are back to their January ’01 levels of employment; but the largest states, Massachusetts and Connecticut, are not.  The Philadelphia Fed indexes of overall state activity, which are based largely on employment- and wage-related data, suggest sluggish growth as well, with Maine and Massachusetts at or near the bottom of the index for the country as a whole.  Even with slow labor growth, certain categories of positions are very hard to fill—in particular, finance, accounting, certain IT specialties, engineers, biotech, and skilled labor for manufacturing.  In fact, one large aircraft manufacturer was quoted as saying that the labor situation as far as he was concerned was insane.  Costs for acquiring certain kinds of labor are rising, but in general, we are not seeing increases across the board in overall expected labor costs.  But given the kinds of labor that are very much an important part of the businesses in the First District, such increases may not be far off. Housing markets are clearly contracting.  We are part of the coastal situation.  Through the second quarter, New England house prices escalated at only half the pace of the United States as a whole, and home foreclosures, while still fairly low, ticked up more significantly in the region than elsewhere.  Permits have fallen sharply, down 25 percent from last year and 22 percent from the year before, though yesterday’s starts data were a bit better for the Northeast than elsewhere. Slower building is leading suppliers of housing products to project declining business later this year as their sales tend to lag a decline in residential real estate markets.  Consumer confidence for the region as a whole dropped off at a faster pace than elsewhere in the nation in August compared with the year before. So there are all those reasons for caution about the growth rate of the New England economy, but not all the data are bad.  Consumer prices, in general, are escalating more slowly, even though energy costs are higher.  Downtown and suburban office vacancy rates are down, and rents are rising.  Hardware and software businesses that were contacted or that are represented on our small-business advisory group report fairly strong revenues and definite concerns about costs. Business confidence measures and surveys were positive both for Massachusetts and Connecticut, reflecting profitable trends and stronger sales and even some strength in manufacturing.  As I mentioned at our last meeting, the growth in personal income in the region, despite slow job growth, is on a par with that of the nation.  Reflecting this and strong corporate profits, state income, sales, and corporate tax revenues are up, in some cases by relatively large percentages.  So even though we have some reasons to be concerned about New England, not everything is negative—though that is sort of hard to find in the local media and you certainly will not hear the politicians talking about it either. Turning to the nation, I would agree that most incoming data since our last meeting have been on the subdued side.  Auto sales, trade data, and certainly anything to do with residential real estate markets have been more subdued than was expected.  Of course, price measures have been subdued as well, at both the headline and the core levels.  But like New England, not everything is slow. I would look at employment growth as fairly solid, even though it has slowed from the beginning of the year.  The surprise in wage and salary income may reflect largely the exercise of stock options, but it could also reflect some pressure on overall wage costs because hiring certain kinds of workers is getting difficult.  Oil prices are down, and gasoline price declines act as a kind of bonus to the consumer.  Consumer spending isn’t too bad.  The latest retail sales data aren’t bad at all; and although confidence bounces around a bit, it seems to have recovered—at least as much as gasoline prices have recovered.  Industrial production seems pretty good, with strong growth in some equipment categories.  Business profits are good.  Orders and shipment data suggest that business spending is solid. I am sort of repeating everything you said, David, and I probably should not do that.  But I seem to be at the same point as people you mentioned in your presentation might be—a little shocked by the slowness of expected GDP over the next couple of quarters.  In fact, when we in Boston look at our baseline forecast, it is a good deal more optimistic largely because we are not seeing as much of a decline in residential investment.  I found the briefing yesterday to the Board interesting, when you tracked your own forecast of residential investment.  At one time we were lower than you were, but you far surpassed us.  In fact, with your decline 50 percent greater than ours in ’06 and quite a bit larger again in ’07, we get a GDP that is 0.3 percentage point higher in ’06 and almost 1 percentage point higher in ’07.  We also see a lower NAIRU, and we have a bit higher estimate of potential—so it does not affect the gap as much, but it does affect the headline number of GDP.  I understand all the mechanics, but the staff forecast is lower than most private forecasts.  I wonder, if growth is that low for that long, whether it might set off a chain reaction of actually higher saving rates than you project and lower confidence that could feed back more strongly than you have anticipated.  In that regard, I found the recent estimates of a rising probability of recession interesting.  I do not think we’re going to have a recession, but I do wonder about it if, in fact, we do realize the slow growth of the Greenbook forecast. However, how much do we really know about how long residential investment will stay negative without a recession?  Mortgage rates are not up that much—only 50 basis points or so from the beginning of the year.  Incomes are rising, and nonhousing wealth is rising.  At some point, buyers should recognize that housing has gotten more affordable and resume desired purchases, perhaps without further major price declines.  Certainly speculative building is off, and investors have backed out of contracts, but how much more of that really will occur?  The Greenbook would suggest another year and a half, but shouldn’t builders be acting quickly now to reduce the amount of overbuilding and to preserve price levels? Underlying demographics and other fundamentals have not changed either. So it is hard actually for me to see that residential investment will be that hard hit that long. I take Janet’s comments about the builders in her District.  I imagine that, if I had talked directly to builders in the First District, they might have been pretty gloomy, too—again, given some reflection of the coastal situation.  I did talk to Nick Retsinas at the Joint Center for Housing Studies, which Harvard runs, and he was not particularly negative.  He felt that a correction is occurring but thought that it would be short-lived.  Now, he did say that they were going to come out with some revisions and that he was still working on them, so his outlook may get more negative. But I am going to try to keep tabs on where they see things because they do stay in touch with all the large builders across the country.  Again, the knock-on effects of lower residential construction may not be all that great.  You mentioned that nonresidential construction is up, but the Greenbook says that it will slow soon.  A good deal of that is oil related; and as long as people are working, incomes are solid, and financial conditions remain pretty accommodative, consumption ought to remain solid. So I wonder whether the Greenbook baseline is really more of a worst-case scenario for residential construction and GDP, though I realize regional effects of the housing slowdown on employment and spending could be considerable.  If growth is faster and if your estimates of the NAIRU and the participation rate are more or less on target, I also wonder about the risks of higher inflation over the forecast period than is the case in the baseline as resource pressures grow. Moderating energy costs are helping here, but they have been volatile in both directions, and I at least would like to see a somewhat longer period below recent highs before declaring victory.  In sum, the rather benign baseline forecast may be the best; but as you noted, there are great ranges of uncertainty.  There are downside risks to be sure, and it is impossible to rule out a recession given the slow growth forecast of the Greenbook.  But I really think the risks to be concerned about lie in the area of stronger growth, more pressure on resources, and higher and more persistent inflation. As many other people have commented, I, too, found the material on inflation persistence of some interest and very well done, though I take the point that it is hard to be confident either about the definition of persistence or about whether it is, in fact, lower or higher.  I would argue here that it might be better to assume, as we consider the stance of policy, more rather than less persistence, in part because we are uncertain and in part because the costs of being wrong are somewhat asymmetric.  If inflation is less persistent and we assume it is not and take a conservative policy stance, inflation should retreat quickly and help shore up our credibility.  Choosing a weaker stance and being wrong about it could be quite costly.  Given the uncertainties facing us, the nature of the incoming data, and the fact that we have already paused, it might not be time right now to take out more inflation insurance, but I certainly think it is time to be very vigilant.  Thank you."
"250";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, I made a special effort to talk with my directors and business contacts about two topics—developments in housing markets and inflation.  My District has been growing at a slower pace than most other parts of the country; consequently, housing prices in the District never appreciated as much as those in the hot markets in the country.  Nonetheless, a major Realtor in our region told me that houses in his market, which includes the northern half of Ohio and the western half of Pennsylvania, are taking longer to sell and that the average price of houses sold from January to August is down about 2 percent compared with the same period last year.  His view is that nationally the housing market still has a way to go before conditions stabilize.  Nevertheless, right now he sees only a limited possibility that the adjustment process will cause serious harm to the U.S. economy. Apparently people are not leaving much to chance.  I heard a report yesterday morning that sales at religious stores for statues of St. Joseph have been soaring.  [Laughter] It seems as though people who are trying to sell their homes are buying statues of St. Joseph because he’s the patron saint of real estate, and they’re burying him next to the “For Sale” sign. Unfortunately, there is no patron saint for central bankers.  [Laughter] Some forecasters, like the Greenbook, are expecting strength in the commercial construction sector to offset much of the weakness in residential building.  One of my directors, who represents a large national commercial construction firm, has indicated that commercial building in the past few years has been boosted by the growth of health and education sectors. His entire book of business increased 10 percent in real terms this year compared with last, and he is looking to next year to have the book of business increase 3 to 4 percent.  However, he is expecting it to be flat in 2008, and his story squares with what I am hearing from bankers as well—namely, that the flow of commercial loans in the pipeline, although not rapidly falling off, is slowing, and it hasn’t been building as it was.  The Greenbook baseline captures very well the pattern that I’ve been describing in its projection for nonresidential investment over the next few years. Now, turning to inflation, the two CPI reports that we received during this intermeeting period have not provided me with enough evidence that inflationary pressures have meaningfully diminished.  The reports, however, have encouraged me to think that the forward momentum has been broken, but I’d like to see the next few CPI numbers be at least as good as those for July and August, if not better, to be convinced that that momentum has been broken.  I’ve heard some hopeful comments regarding inflation in the past few weeks from several of my directors.  Just a few months ago they were indicating that elevated energy prices and material prices had provided them with an opportunity to get more-generalized price increases, and they had wondered whether that was going to be a one-time catch-up opportunity or whether it would be persistent. Now it appears to have been a one-time opportunity, which is passing or has passed. Several of my directors reported last week that they have resorted to unbundling their prices to cope with the rising prices of energy and material costs.  On their invoices, they are breaking out the price increases that are due to the increased cost of steel, copper, energy, and shipping in order to pass them on.  Apparently, their customers are willing to accept price increases that are due to those increased energy and material costs.  But the expectation on the part of both buyers and sellers is that, as energy and material costs dissipate, the ability to pass on price increases will be removed.  Several of my directors said that they are not planning any price increases for the next year and that they suspect their commodity costs will be lower than they were this year as well. As others have mentioned, there has been some interest in the elevated unit labor costs in the second-quarter productivity and cost reports.  As Dave noted, the compensation growth underlying unit labor costs was boosted when the BLS took on board the first-quarter unemployment insurance tax records.  There is some suspicion that the dramatic increase in compensation had a lot to do with stock options and incentive pay, but the underlying data are not available yet, so we don’t know for sure. My staff was able to get some summary figures for Ohio. Compensation has been growing steadily in Ohio over the past several years, but the preliminary figures are flat for the first quarter of 2006.  However, there was double-digit growth in three sectors—management of companies, finance and insurance, and utilities.  These sectors are often the ones that show substantial growth in the first quarters because they pay out stock options and that’s often when those stock options are realized.  So at least in my District there is no evidence of any broad-based acceleration in compensation, and I tend to agree with the staff’s view that it’s too early to incorporate those higher unit labor costs into the inflation outlook. At our last meeting, I expressed the opinion that whatever weakness we would see in GDP was more likely to reflect demand factors than supply factors, and therefore I saw risks to both our objectives. The current Greenbook baseline projection for GDP is even lower than it was at the time of our last meeting because of revisions, as Dave mentioned, to both supply and demand factors.  I still think that, if the Greenbook projection comes true, softer demand is likely to be the more dominant explanation.  Nevertheless, I would like to see further evidence that inflationary pressures have been checked, if not actually reversed, before I would conclude that the risks to our objectives are evenly balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"251";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, the data bearing on the near-term economic outlook suggest both slower economic growth and a bit less core price inflation going forward.  In terms of economic activity, the recent news has been uniformly negative, resulting in a significant downward revision to growth in the Greenbook.  Indeed, compared with the outlook of other forecasters, the Greenbook’s projection of real GDP growth for the second half of this year is quite pessimistic; it would now rank in the lower 5 percent tail of the distribution of individual Blue Chip forecasters.  I think this pessimism is not completely unfounded, however, largely because of my worries about the housing sector.  The speed of the falloff in housing activity and the deceleration in house prices continue to surprise us.  In the view of our contacts, the data lag reality, and it seems a good bet that things will get worse before they get better. A major homebuilder who is on one of our boards tells us that home inventory has gone through the roof, so to speak.  [Laughter]  He literally said that.  With the share of unsold homes topping 80 percent in some of the new subdivisions around Phoenix and Las Vegas, he has labeled these the new ghost towns of the West.  In fact, he described the situation at a recent board meeting in Boise.  He had toured some new subdivisions on the outskirts of Boise and discovered that the houses, most of which are unoccupied, are now being dressed up to look occupied—with curtains, things in the driveway, and so forth—so as not to discourage potential buyers.  The general assessment is that this overhang of speculative inventory implies that permits and starts will continue to fall. Inventory ratios will rise, and the market probably will not recover until 2008.  So far, builders remain hesitant to cut prices, fearing that doing so will cause a surge in cancellation rates on sold but unfinished homes.  However, builders now routinely offer huge incentives, and price cuts appear inevitable.  We have been following the Case Schiller house-price index, which is based on house-price data in ten large urban markets, three of which are in California.  Beginning in May of this year, futures contracts on this price index also began trading; they suggest that house prices will be falling at an annual rate of about 6 percent by the end of this year.  Of course, trading in this new futures market is still somewhat thin, but it is a signal that we need to keep a very close eye on the incoming data and watch whether the housing slowdown is turning into a slump. Turning to inflation, core measures of consumer price inflation remain well above my comfort zone, but the latest readings on consumer prices have been modestly better.  Unlike the Greenbook, I think the outlook for inflation has actually improved a bit since our last meeting largely because of the recent drop in commodity and crude oil prices.  The relief on energy prices is, of course, very welcome, but we do have to be careful not to overestimate the extent to which past energy price pass-through has been boosting core inflation.  For example, airfares might seem like an obvious case in which outsized consumer price increases reflect energy price pass-through. However, our staff recently calculated the share of jet fuel costs to total airline operating expenses and estimated that the jump in those costs likely accounted for less than half the rise in airfares this year.  Instead, airfares may reflect strong demand and constrained capacity as indicated by very high airline passenger load factors.  Still it seems likely that energy pass-through has played at least some role in the run-up of core inflation this year, so any energy price pressure on core inflation is likely to dissipate over time. Now, as David noted, the Greenbook has completely offset the favorable effects on core inflation from lower energy prices by boosting the growth rate of labor costs.  In contrast, I attach a little less weight to the recent data on compensation per hour.  My guess is that most of the difference between hourly compensation and the ECI does relate to profit-linked items like bonuses and stock options, and that suggests to me that marginal costs of production are not rising significantly faster.  Even if they are, it remains true that markups are high.  So with sufficient competitive pressures, firms have room to absorb cost increases without fully passing them into prices. Finally, I want to add my compliments to those of others to the Board’s staff for a very interesting analysis of inflation dynamics and monetary policy.  As I mentioned at our last meeting, it may be unduly pessimistic to assume that the recent rise in inflation will be highly persistent. Over the past ten years, estimated reduced-form models suggest that core inflation generally returns to its sample average after several quarters.  Recently our staff examined persistence at a more disaggregated level and found that the same general pattern also holds for each of the major components of the core PCE price index, with price inflation for durables only slightly more persistent than price inflation for nondurables and services.  In the current situation, this suite of regressive models indicates that core PCE inflation should fall to just below 2 percent by the middle of next year.  I am not quite as optimistic as these simple models, but on balance my concerns about the inflation outlook have been slightly alleviated by recent developments."
"252";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20060920meeting.csv";" Thank you. Let me just start with the broad contours of our outlook. Growth has obviously slowed. The second half is likely to be relatively weak, but the only place we see pronounced weakness is in housing, and we expect a return to moderate growth going forward. Core inflation seems to be easing a bit, and it may have peaked in the second quarter, if you look just at the three-month annualized numbers.  But inflation remains uncomfortably high, and our forecast assumes only a very gradual moderation over the next two years. In terms of numbers, we expect the real economy to grow at around its 3 percent potential rate in ’07 and ’08. We expect core PCE inflation on a Q4/Q4 basis to come in just below 2½ percent in ’06 and to moderate to about 2 percent in ’07 and 1.8 percent in ’08.  Our outlook is largely unchanged from August.  It’s conditioned on a path for policy that is flat at current levels for two to three quarters. This puts us slightly above the level that is currently priced into the risk-adjusted Eurodollar futures curve. In terms of uncertainty and risk, we see somewhat greater downside risks to demand growth than we saw in August, but the inflation risks still seem likely to be to the upside. Weighing the balance among these competing risks, we believe, as we did in August, that inflation risks should remain the predominant concern of the Committee, not so much, to borrow the Chairman’s formulation, because the probability of a higher inflation outcome is substantially greater than that of a much weaker growth outcome but because the costs of an erosion in inflation performance would be more damaging. On the growth outlook, we’re seeing a somewhat greater adjustment in residential investment than we anticipated, but this has not yet induced or been accompanied by a significant weakness outside housing.  Of course, the outlook for the economy as a whole should not be particularly sensitive to plausible estimates of the direct effects of the remaining adjustment, whatever it is, left in residential investment.  What seems more important, of course, is the potential effect of what’s happening in housing on consumer and business spending.  We just don’t see troubling signs yet of collateral damage, and we are not expecting much.  The fundamentals supporting relatively strong productivity growth seem to be intact.  The acceleration of the nominal compensation growth that appears to be under way, combined with the moderation of headline inflation that we expect as energy prices moderate, should produce fairly strong growth of household income, even with the moderation in employment growth to trend. Corporate balance sheet profitability remains strong.  Domestic demand growth outside the United States is expected to remain quite robust even though there has been some moderation in current measures of activity in some markets.  Of course, the level of interest rates is not particularly high in nominal or real terms.  Equity prices and credit spreads suggest a reasonable degree of confidence in the prospects for future expansion.  Financial market participants report very strong continued demand for credit and for risk generally and very ample liquidity.  This strength may reflect other factors that are operating on demand for financial assets, but still survey-based measures of confidence have not deteriorated dramatically.  This, of course, may prove too optimistic on the growth outlook, and the risks seem weighted to the downside. On the inflation front, recent data have not altered our forecast or, really, our assessment of the risks to that forecast.  Although there are signs of moderation in underlying inflation, the core PCE and a range of alternative measures continue to grow at levels that are uncomfortably high. We expect further moderation to occur only gradually over the forecast period.  The latest data have been somewhat reassuring, and inflation expectations at various horizons have behaved relatively well since our last meeting.  The acceleration in compensation growth and unit labor costs does not justify a higher inflation forecast in our view, provided that expectations remain well anchored, business markups fall, the ongoing moderation in growth reduces pressure on resource utilization, the futures curve proves a reasonably accurate prediction for the path of energy prices, the dollar declines only modestly, and so forth.  These are reasonably good arguments, but we still think the risks are to the upside.  Over the past two years, we have consistently revised up our forecasts for inflation.  I’m not sure we really yet understand the forces behind the unanticipated acceleration in underlying inflation.  Medium-term inflation expectations, while not rising at stated levels, may be higher than is consistent with an inflation objective in the range the Committee has talked about in the past. Containing these upside risks should be the dominant focus of policy until we see a more-pronounced moderation in current and expected underlying inflation. As my comments imply, we don’t have a lot of differences with the Greenbook on the contours of the outlook.  The Greenbook shows slower growth relative to lower potential but also more inflation than we do.  It also shows more slack with more inflation and a little less confidence in the strength of demand growth than we do for the reasons I hope I explained. I see certain questions as key.  On the growth front the question is, Will weakness cumulate?  If we see a more-pronounced actual decline in housing prices, will that have greater damage on confidence and spending?  But the more interesting questions are really on the inflation forecast, and let me just talk very briefly about two. First, does the Greenbook forecast produce enough moderation in inflation soon enough to keep inflation expectations anchored?  The baseline forecast has inflation falling to 1.5 percent, at least based on the last time we saw a long-term forecast, only over a very protracted period—a period that is significantly longer than the one many central bankers would consider an acceptable deviation from an inflation target.  We have already seen a bit of troubling speculation from people who write about us.  This Committee may have more inflation tolerance or a higher implicit target than its predecessor.  Should we try to achieve a more rapid moderation of inflation? How should we evaluate the costs and benefits of trying to achieve a quicker and more substantial moderation of inflation, particularly given the tenuous state of the evidence on inertia and persistence?  Is this gentle and gradual expected moderation in inflation optimal, given the softness of the outlook for demand?  These are questions that are worthy of a more explicit discussion by the Committee, particularly if we’re going to talk about moving toward a quantitative definition of price stability with more disclosure around the forecast. The second and related question is about inflation in our forecast:  With the stance of monetary policy that is now priced into the markets—this is a softer path than the one in August—how confident can we be that we are likely to achieve the forecast of sustained growth and gradually moderating core inflation?  I think we can be less confident than the confidence you might read into current market expectations and the uncertainty that surrounds them.  Of course, the behavior of long-term inflation expectations in financial markets suggests that this risk is not particularly high at present and that we can take some more time to get a better handle on the evolution of the economy before deciding what is next in terms of monetary policy actions. But I think that we may have more to do, and we should try to avoid fostering too much confidence in the markets that we’re done.  We need to preserve the flexibility to do more if that proves necessary to keep inflation expectations anchored.  Thank you."
"253";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Any other questions?  Dave and Karen, thank you, as always, for a very good report.  We’re ready now for the economic go-round.  We haven’t made much use of the two-handed intervention lately, but it’s an option.  If you want to make a comment or ask a question, please raise two hands instead of one.  We’ll start with President Moskow.,   Okay, Governor Kohn.,   President Moskow, didn’t you say that you saw output growing below potential in ’07?  Did I hear correctly?,   So with energy prices down and so forth, why do you see core inflation rising from near-term levels?,   President Minehan.,   President Plosser.,   Thank you.  President Pianalto.,   Thank you.  President Hoenig.,   Thank you.  First Vice President Barron.,   That reminds me of the Navy saying: “If it stands still, paint it.  If it moves, salute it.”  [Laughter]  President Fisher.,   President Hoenig.,   President Minehan, did you have something?,   President Fisher.,   President Stern.,   Thank you.  President Poole.,   Thank you.  President Yellen.,   Thank you.  It’s just a little after 4:00.  Why don’t we take a coffee break and come back at 4:20? [Coffee break],   Mr. Stockton.,   Thank you.  President Lacker.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn,   Thank you.  Governor Bies.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   I second the motion.  [Laughter],   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you.  Let me summarize what I heard, and then I would like to make a few comments of my own. There were several themes around the table.  Many people noted the bimodal economy. Housing is still quite weak, although a number of people noted that they thought the lower tail had been trimmed somewhat.  Autos are undergoing inventory adjustment, and some people noted slowing in a few other sectors.  However, the general view was that spillovers from housing to the rest of the economy had not yet occurred.  Most people noted that the labor market is quite healthy, with widespread shortages of labor, particularly of skilled workers.  It was further noted that consumption spending would be supported by the job market, by income growth, and by the fall in energy prices.  Overall, the assessments of growth, as I heard them, were that it would be moderate going forward, either around potential or perhaps slightly below potential, and some saw a bit of upside risk to that projection. With respect to inflation, costs of raw materials and energy are rising more slowly or are declining, and headline inflation has fallen with energy costs.  Some felt that core inflation would moderate gradually, but others were less confident about that.  The behavior of rents and the behavior of productivity are two important unknowns going forward, and wage growth probably presents the biggest upside risk to inflation.  Most members expressed concerns that the high level of inflation could raise inflation expectations and undermine Fed credibility.  So the general view, which I think essentially everyone shares, was that the upside risks to inflation exceed the downside risks to growth at this juncture. I hope that summary was okay; let me just make a few comments of my own.  As a number of people noted, the intermeeting data were actually fairly limited.  The employment report did indicate a fairly strong labor market.  There is still, to my mind, some disconnect between the anecdotes and the data; in particular, the wage data do not yet reflect what I’m hearing around the table about wage premiums.  For example, average hourly earnings actually grew more slowly in the third quarter than in the second quarter.  I think the ECI next week will be a very important check for our anecdotes.  On the positive side, as Kevin and others noted, the tone was generally stronger in financial markets.  The stock market is up.  I note the ten-year real rate was up about 15 basis points since the last meeting, which I take to be a positive indication of growth. Oil prices continue to decline, which obviously is good for both growth and inflation.  I thought you might be interested in thinking about the quantity effects of the decline in oil prices. We’ve had a decline in oil prices of about $15, which back-of-the-envelope calculations or FRB/US analysis can tell us should add about 0.45 percent to the level of real consumption or about 0.35 percent to the level of real GDP.  Dave Reifschneider was very helpful in finding those numbers.  That’s a change to the level, so the oil price declines could add 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point to growth, say, over the next six quarters.  Another way to look at that is to think about the relationship between oil prices and house prices.  A rule of thumb that might be useful is that a $3 decline in oil prices offsets approximately a 1 percentage point decline in house prices in terms of overall consumption effects.  So oil price declines are essentially the negative equivalent of a 5 percent decline in house prices.  An interesting question that we may have to address at some point is, what is the policy implication of oil price declines?  I think it’s clear that oil price declines will lower both total and core inflation, but will also increase growth. Therefore, our policy response to the lower oil prices could depend on our preferences about growth versus inflation and also our assessments of the risks to both of those variables. On the housing correction, I agree that there is perhaps some reduction in the lower tail. But it’s important to point out that, even if we see some stabilization in starts and permits, a lot of inventory is still out there, and there’s going to be an inventory correction process that could be quite significant.  The current months’ supply of homes for sale is greater than 6 now, excluding cancellations; the number over the past eight years has been very stable around 4, although before 1997 it was higher and more variable, which is a source of uncertainty.  To get a sense of the magnitudes of the potential housing correction, I asked Josh Gallin to do the following simple simulation.  Single-family housing sales were about 1.0 million at an annual rate in July, about 1.05 million in August.  So I asked Josh to consider a case in which sales flatten out at the level of 1.1 million and continue at that level indefinitely; in addition, homebuilders respond to three-fourths of the increase in sales by extra building and allow the other fourth to go into reducing inventory.  When you do that calculation, you find that you actually work off the inventory.  By the end of 2008, the months’ supply is down to 4.1.  Part of that decrease occurs because the sales level is higher, and so the denominator is bigger as well. Thus that particular scenario is a sensible one in terms of getting the inventories down. However, the effects on GDP, because the correction is still significant, are not trivial, but they are also not that large.  The effect of this scenario on GDP growth from the fourth quarter of this year to the second quarter of next year is about 0.2 on growth and about 0.1 in the third and fourth quarters.  So a very substantial part of the housing correction is still in place because of the need to work off inventories over the next few quarters. Those are a few comments on the real side.  I think that some of the tail risk has been reduced.  I agree with the Greenbook that growth should be slow, at least through the first quarter of next year, because of housing corrections, but consumption will probably pick up and lead to a stronger growth path after that. Let me say a few words about inflation.  I think I need to push back a little on the view that there has been no improvement in core inflation or total inflation.  In fact, inflation is very slow to respond to its determinants, and the fact that we actually have seen some improvement in some sense is a positive surprise, not a negative surprise.  The attention that’s paid to the twelve-month lagging inflation measure is a problem in this context, because we had four months of 0.3 percent readings from March to June, and they’re going to stay in that twelve- month lagging measure until next March.  I can predict with great confidence that next March through next June the twelve-month lagging inflation measure will decline.  So I think it’s more useful, President Lacker, to look, a bit at least, at the higher-frequency measures to see what the trend of movement is.  Although, like President Lacker and others, I’m not happy with the level, I think the direction is actually very good.  For example, the core CPI three-month went from 3.79 in May to 2.75 in September, so it’s a decline of 104 basis points.  The core PCE three- month inflation measure went from 2.95 in May to 2.20 in September, using the staff estimate for the core PCE deflator for September.  So it’s certainly moving in the right direction. The other comment I would make about this subject is that we must keep in mind how much is tied to the owners’ equivalent rent component.  I would say, in fact, that once you exclude that, if you do, just for comparison, that 2006 is roughly equivalent to 2005 in terms of core PCE inflation.  To look at the high frequency numbers, excluding OER, which I’m doing now for illustrative purposes, core CPI fell from 3.01 in May to 2.23 in September, and core PCE inflation fell from 2.52 in May to 1.93 in September at an annual rate.  This is saying that a significant part of the speedup and now the decline in the rate is related to this owners’ equivalent rent phenomenon—not all of it, but a significant part.  It’s important to know that because, as we’ve discussed around the table, the OER may have its own dynamic.  It may respond in different ways to monetary policy than some other components do.  It is an imputed price, which people do not actually observe, and so it may have a different effect on expectations than, say, gasoline prices or other easily observed prices.  The other important aspect of the OER is that, to the extent that it is a major source of the inflation problem, it makes clear that inflation probably has not been a wage-push problem so far because owners’ equivalent rent is obviously the cost of buildings, not the cost of labor.  So if you look at inflation over the past few months, there has been slow improvement, and so far I don’t think that we have seen a great deal of feedthrough of wage pressures into inflation.  I’ve looked through all the various categories of goods and services whose prices have increased, and I can find no particular relationship to labor market factors. Another comment along this line:  It’s also true that inflation of even 2.20 percent, which was the core PCE three-month inflation rate in September, is too high in the long run.  I agree it should be lower than that.  We do have to ask ourselves, given that inflation has been high and that, as people pointed out, it has been high for a number of years now, how quickly we should bring it down.  Most optimal monetary policy models will suggest that a slow reduction is what you would try to achieve if you start off far away from the target and if the real economy is relatively weak.  Now, the question arises whether we are going in the right direction.  I think so far we are, but I would certainly agree that we have to ensure that we continue to go in the right direction.  The Greenbook forecast is predicated on a constant federal funds rate from the current level; actually the rate declines in 2008.  But what it leaves out is the notion that we are gathering information and trying to resolve uncertainty, depending on how things develop.  Obviously, policy can respond in one direction or another and could, if inflation does not continue to decline, be more aggressive to achieve that.  I felt I needed to talk a bit about the fact that we do have some improvement in inflation, and so the situation cannot really be said to be deteriorating. Having said all of that, now let me come back and agree with what I’ve heard, which is that, although we have not yet seen much wage-push inflation, clearly the risk is there. Anecdotally, and to some extent statistically, we have very tight labor markets.  It is surprising how little wage push there has been so far, and if labor markets continue to stay at this level of tightness, then one would expect that you would get an inflation effect that would be uncomfortably persistent.  That is a real concern, which I share with everyone around the table. If the Phillips curve language doesn’t appeal to you, another way of thinking about it is that, if the labor market stays this tight, which means that growth is at potential or better, then the real interest rate that is consistent with that growth rate needs to be higher than it is now.  I agree with that point as well.  So my bottom line is that I do agree that inflation is the greater risk, certainly. I think that the downside risk from output has been slightly reduced.  I also think the upside risk to inflation has been slightly reduced.  Thus we’re not in all that different a position than we were at our last meeting.  We can discuss the implications of that tomorrow.  I think I’ll stop there.  Yes, President Poole."
"254";"MR. BARRON.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Data releases and reports we have gathered over the intermeeting period do not indicate much change since the Committee last met, so far as the Sixth District is concerned.  Overall growth has been moderate, with the index of District economic activity showing a year-over-year increase of about 2.7 percent, and reports of activity varied considerably among sectors of the District economy.  Retail sales have been mixed, and the outlook for tourism is reasonably optimistic.  Auto sales remain sluggish, and the housing market—even beyond Florida, where both prices and sales have declined significantly— continues to show additional signs of some slowing.  On the positive side, construction is shifting somewhat from residential to commercial.  However, the lack of availability and the high cost of home and business insurance in Florida and along the Gulf Coast is a serious concern for our region.  Manufacturing activity appears stable.  Prices of some commodities are reported lower.  Although gasoline prices are lower, fuel surcharges remain in place.  As in the national economy, the slowdown in housing and moderation in overall activity have shown little signs of spilling over into the labor market. Employment gains through September softened somewhat.  However, all states in the District, except Georgia, added jobs, and together accounted for 20,000 of the nation’s 51,000 jobs added during the month.  The overall unemployment rate in the District, accordingly, moved down to 3.9 percent.  Shortages of skilled labor continue to be reported in some areas, and overall labor quality, as Tom Hoenig noted, continues to be a problem, both of which I interpret as indicating a relatively firm labor market.  We had a meeting this past week of our Advisory Council on Small Business, Agriculture, and Labor.  Nearly to a person, participants reported things were good—not great but good—and the common problem was finding qualified workers willing to work.  Most council members were willing to hire if they found the right people, but at the same time, they would forgo expanding their businesses if it meant hiring individuals who were less than qualified.  One member from the construction sector noted that an individual walking around a job site with a piece of pipe, without doing anything else, would fully meet the requirements for continued employment—that is, they were carrying something, and they were moving.  [Laughter] Concerning the national economy, opinions differ as to how much of a slowdown we will see this quarter and how long it will last.  Most professional forecasters, as well as our own in-house models, suggest that growth will slow in the third quarter and then gradually accelerate thereafter.  On the positive side, the labor market is very healthy.  Corporate earnings continue to be healthy, business investment is supportive, and equity markets not only are at record highs but show no signs of letting up.  At the same time, our headline inflation has come down, in the most part because of the decline in energy prices.  Core inflation, especially in the service price component, continues to drift upward.  Further, it’s not clear that the energy price increases have played a major role in explaining the increase in core inflation, so it may be problematic to assume that the recent decline will provide a significant downward impetus to core inflation, at least in the near term.  Federal funds futures prices, the TIPS spread, and inflation expectations seem to be saying that the Fed’s credibility remains intact and are consistent with the belief that the Committee will get policy right, rather than signaling that slower growth is ahead in the foreseeable future.  Thank you."
"255";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, at our last meeting I engaged in a little Texas brag.  I mentioned that the employment growth rate in our District was twice that of the national average. Then I read in the pre-briefing for the Board last night the penultimate sentence, which had a wonderful three-word phrase—“Humility is required.”  So let me report that economic growth in our District has slowed somewhat, and I want to put the “somewhat” in perspective.  We redid the numbers of our first-quarter real GDP growth.  Growth of the state real gross product for the first quarter was 9 percent for the Eleventh District.  So it’s not a great wonder that it is slowing—it is slowing down from too torrid a pace.  But our housing sector is still sweet—perhaps the only spot left in the country—particularly in the Houston area.  We actually are building a new auto plant, President Moskow, a Toyota plant in San Antonio, which is getting an inordinate amount of attention.  The exports from our state are growing at a monthly rate annualized at 45 percent, and Texas is now the largest exporting state in the nation.  So from the standpoint of economic growth, even as I am trying to be humble, the District is doing exceedingly well. The only consistently sour note that we hear is what you have heard around this table—and just now from First Vice President Barron—that we have continued reports of shortages of skilled and unskilled labor, from chemical engineers to school teachers to bank tellers and even to hotel housekeeping staff.  So we have a significant problem in terms of labor shortages—skilled, semi- skilled, and now, increasingly, unskilled.  To put some numbers on this, we have a contact who has surveyed fifty plants on the Gulf Coast for the price of welders.  In eight months, the price for a welder has gone from $19 an hour to $25 an hour.  You have to pay them a bonus of $100 when they show up, and you have to pay them a completion bonus as well.  The bottom line is that in the Eleventh District we’re behaving as though we were a full-employment economy. In the rest of my comments, I’d like to emphasize not my District but our views on the U.S. and the global economies, particularly the U.S. economy.  I want to go back to your concluding remarks, Mr. Chairman, at the last meeting, when you reminded us that, if we believe we need to have output below potential to help address inflation pressures, it’s a delicate operation, and we may have a very narrow channel to navigate as we go forward—just to keep with your naval analogy of a few seconds ago.  This summer I sailed the Corinth Canal, which is so narrow that at times you feel you can reach out and touch both sides.  Even though I was on vacation, I was actually thinking of one side as the shoals of slow economic growth—almost recessionary growth, which seems to be what the Greenbook is forecasting at least for the third quarter, and the risk that seems to be out there—and of the other side as the shoals of inflation. From the 27 or 28 CEOs and CFOs to whom I spoke in preparing for this meeting, as I always do, I do hear reports of a slowdown.  I talked to two of the Big Five housebuilders this time. They are cutting back significantly.  Let me give you some numbers.  For example, Centex owns 109,000 lots outright and has 54,000 lots under hard option and 80,000 lots under soft option, as they call it.  They’ve canceled 25 percent of their hard options.  That is $85 million worth of properties.  Hovnanian is walking away from $100 million worth of hard option properties.  The effort there is to cut back so that what was a two-month leading supply has now become a three- month leading supply.  You can see how the dynamics are beginning to work.  They’re moving on price, but they are also trying to shut down their inventory and are taking very quick action.  That is a depressing factor.  One of the truck dealers I talked with, Rush Enterprises, has about $2.7 billion a year in sales.  I believe they are the largest in the country; they are nationwide.  They are reporting that Christmas retail activity seems to be backing up; in other words, it is slower than it was in previous years.  This is an operator with 41 years of experience.  They are also building their inventory, particularly in the coastal areas, with the heavy trucks that are going to be used for home construction.  The book-to-bill ratio for Texas Instruments has fallen below 1; it is the lowest since 2000.  And if you read the newspapers, you will see that the airlines are offering very deep discounts and for longer periods than before.  So there seems to be a slowdown in activity. With that said, when you talk to the rails, there is a diminution of growth, perhaps 1 percent third quarter over second quarter, and if you talk to UPS, as I reported last time, you’re still seeing some rather robust reports of economic growth of 2 to 3 percent.  I think the best way to summarize the economy is, as President Moskow said earlier, that although there are weak signs, the economy is still robust.  The chairman and CEO of Cadbury-Schweppes said, “I keep looking and listening, but I’m just not seeing what everybody tells me is going to happen.”  Again, as I reported last time, the CEO of EDS, who is an experienced businessman, said, “It’s a funny period.  Everybody is prepared to be bearish, but it’s simply not materializing.”  So, David, from an economic standpoint, both from the anecdotal evidence and our own economic modeling, we don’t quite accept the Greenbook’s forecast of the kind of slowdown that you’re expecting for the third quarter or for the second half. There are positive benefits, and the benefits are, of course, with price pressure abatement. My favorite anecdotal example, by the way, comes from globalization at work, Karen. Interestingly, the CEO of Fluor, who is one of my contacts, reports that when they bid for the Bay Bridge construction, their bid on U.S. steel prices was rejected as being too expensive.  They went back and bid based on what they could buy steel from China for, and the bid was accepted. Canadian steel now sells for 25 percent less than U.S. steel, and Chinese steel is being dumped into this market at a price 40 percent lower than Canadian steel.  From the standpoint of raw materials and energy, you have seen price pressure abatement.  But from businessperson after businessperson, we still hear the same reports, Mr. Chairman, that we hear in our District and that you’ve heard around this table, which is of significant price pressures stemming from labor.  As I mentioned earlier, it is not just skilled labor; it is now semi-skilled labor such as truck drivers and welders. Increasingly shortages are being reported, throughout our District and the rest of the country. So I would summarize by agreeing with President Moskow in that we in the Eleventh District find the Greenbook’s projection of economic growth to be too pessimistic.  Although price pressures have abated somewhat, we know by our measure—the trimmed-mean PCE, off of which we key our view of the economy—that the three-month rate is still running at 2.9 percent and the twelve-month rate is running at 2.7 percent.  I would argue as we navigate this narrow channel, Mr. Chairman, whether it’s the channel you describe or the Corinth Canal, that I would be more careful of the inflationary shoals than of the risk of excessive slowdown of growth.  Thank you.,   The question that I put to each contact was to compare the third quarter with the second quarter.  I was trying to get a feel because I’m quite concerned about our staff analysis and the Greenbook’s analysis of the dramatic slowdown to 1 percent in third-quarter growth.  So the answer is, yes, there is a slowdown, but it is not now of the severity that our staff projection seems to indicate.  But I do want to note that there is some slowdown taking place.,   Part of that, by the way, is in the average fleet of, say, Class A trucks, which are the big ones.  The average fleet age is now fourteen months; the normal fleet age is twenty-two months.  Part of that has to do with all of these Environmental Protection Agency changes that keep being mandated.  So you have to sort out that distortion from economic activity.  But the point I was reporting is that the utilization of those trucks in terms of carrying Christmas inventory appears to have slowed and is not running at the pace that it was in previous years.,   Mr. Chairman, very quickly—I asked two of the big homebuilders to whom I spoke about that very phenomenon.  Their answer was very interesting.  They have strong balance sheets.  One of them said, “I can feel the private equity shark swimming around my feet.”  In fact, there is rumor of one sizable deal that has been proposed—I haven’t been able to figure out what it is—to take one of them entirely private.  So some of the buttressing, President Minehan, is coming from significant amounts of liquidity in the system.,   Then we’ll be waiting for a completion bonus.  [Laughter]"
"256";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, I’ll start with the District this time, and I will tell you that conditions in the District remain generally good.  Energy activity remains strong, both in the traditional sectors, such as gas, oil, and coal, and in our new sector called ethanol.  [Laughter] They are booming, I’m afraid.  Despite the recent decline in energy prices, we are not yet hearing, in talking to different producers in the region, about any significant pullback in energy production.  In part, this situation reflects a prevailing view right now among those producers that the weakness in energy prices is likely to be temporary.  However, if energy prices remain at current levels or move lower at a sustained rate, I think we will then see some pullback in retail activity and so forth—more than we’ve seen so far. In other areas of the District economy, we saw some softening in manufacturing activity in the third quarter, but our manufacturing survey shows that businesses remain mostly optimistic about future hiring and capital expenditure plans.  Housing activity has certainly slowed across the District.  However, we have received few reports of unusual weakness in our recent meetings with directors and economic advisory council members.  So it is slowing but shows no sign of collapse, at this point anyway.  We have also seen, with the decline in energy prices, strengthening in District retail sales activity and a sharp rebound in expectations for retail activity in the fourth quarter—except for domestic auto sales.  Labor markets remain firm across the District.  Unemployment rates are low, and our directors and other contacts continue to report shortages of skilled labor across the District.  District agricultural conditions remain rather mixed.  Drought continues to affect much of the western part of our region.  However, livestock and crop prices have been supported by strong world demand and lower supply, so those farmers who are able to bring in a crop are doing quite well. Turning to the national economy, I think that the recent decline in energy prices will provide important support to the near-term outlook.  Currently, I see second-half growth of around 2 percent, rebounding to between 2½ and 3 percent as we get into next year.  Generally speaking, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook, both in the near term and for the next year. Indeed, with the current financial conditions that others have talked about, I don’t envision the pullback in consumer spending and business investment spending that the Greenbook has projected at this point. One area that is worth discussion—and Dave talked about it a bit in responding to a question—is the employment outlook, an area for which the Greenbook continues to have, as Dave said, a different perspective.  Although demographic forces will clearly work in the direction of slower labor force growth in the coming years, I’m not as convinced that the slowdown will be as sharp or as sudden as the Greenbook suggests right now.  I say that because I want to be cautious about viewing the recent slowing in monthly employment growth as being driven by these demographic factors.  I believe the recent slowing in employment largely reflects some employer caution about the economic outlook, combined with the effects of weakness in housing and retail sales.  Support for this view can be found in the recent slowing of growth in temporary help that has been reported to us.  Should the economic growth pick up, as I anticipate, we should begin to see some stronger employment numbers as we get into next year. As to the effects of demographics—again, I think they are going to play a very important part, but another significant factor to keep in mind is the educational composition of the labor force and the skills composition as we move forward in terms of labor demand, because that’s the shortage we’re always hearing about. Now, returning to the near-term outlook, the recent decline in energy prices has helped to counter the effects of housing weaknesses.  Consequently, the downside risk to the outlook has diminished somewhat.  However, because we have not necessarily seen the bottom of the housing market, I do believe that that is an important downside risk to the economy. Finally, let me share some of my perspective on the inflation outlook.  My overall views on inflation have not changed materially since the last meeting.  I continue to expect core CPI inflation to moderate from about 2.8 percent to about 2.5 percent next year and, similarly, core PCE inflation to moderate from about 2.3 percent to 2.1 percent.  A significant fall in prices for oil and gasoline and natural gas in recent weeks has already begun to show through to overall inflation.  I believe this is a positive development in helping to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored and perhaps in helping to moderate core inflation next year.  Although the decline in energy prices has reduced the upside risk to inflation somewhat, I agree with others that core inflation does remain too high, and I think we have to keep that in mind as we consider our policy options.  Thank you.,   Richard, clarify for me.  You said that some of your national contacts were seeing a slowdown in the book of business.  Is that the minority of the contacts?  I’m not quite sure I know what you were conveying.,   As to your reference to the trucking company—one of our trucking company contacts indicated that business is still good.  Their bookings out have been reduced from three weeks to about four or five days.  So they’ve seen a slowdown, but they’re still busy.  They still have business coming in.,   I agree.  Thank you."
"257";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  I wondered, President Moskow, if you had a sense of whether Ford was in a kind of death spiral—I might be influenced by the headlines of today and yesterday—at risk of losing the confidence of customers, so it won’t be able to sell cars, and of creditors.  I’m wondering whether that would have any effect on the macroeconomy, or whether we just take down the Ford signs, put up Toyota signs, and continue to produce.,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Committee’s focus has been on encouraging a gradual abatement of core inflation, and I think the limited evidence we’ve gotten since the last meeting is consistent with this outcome.  The price data themselves show some signs of deceleration of core inflation on a three-month basis from the very high levels of last spring and summer, though the rates are still elevated.  A further decline in energy prices should help to keep inflation expectations down and will take a little pressure off business costs and core inflation even if pass-throughs are fairly small.  As expected, the rent-of-shelter component has been increasing less rapidly, supporting the projection that, in a soft housing market with overhangs of unsold housing units, this component will not be boosting measured inflation rates very much.  Inflation expectations as derived from financial market quotes remain at the lower levels reached earlier this fall.  As the Bluebook notes, the exact level of these expectations is really impossible to tease out of the data; and although they may be a bit higher than we would like, they do look lower than the recent twelve-month inflation rates and, at these levels, should exert some downward gravitational pull on realized inflation. The economy appears to be running modestly below the rate of growth of its potential, and this should relieve pressure on labor and product markets.  How far the economy is running below potential in an underlying sense is uncertain.  I suspect it is not as weak as the estimated third-quarter GDP number but is somewhat softer than the labor market indicators, which show no slackening in the pace of demand or decline in resource utilization.  I base this conclusion in part on the data and projections of final domestic and total demand, which the Greenbook has averaging in the neighborhood of 2 percent in the second half of the year.  Industrial production was weak in August and September, pulled down by the ongoing inventory corrections in housing and autos, and this reinforced my sense that, at least for a time, the economy is growing a bit below the rate of growth of its potential.  Going forward, I think a projection of economic growth gradually recovering next year as the drag from housing abates is reasonable, with growth supported by favorable financial conditions and lower energy prices.  How quickly it returns to potential is an open question.  Though other forms of spending have proven resilient to date, I agree with the staff analysis that some spillovers on consumption and investment from the weakness in housing and in housing wealth are likely to restrain growth at least a little next year. I also see that the spending risk is still pointed somewhat to the downside, although less so than at the last meeting.  To be sure, the recent signs are somewhat reassuring that the housing market isn’t weakening faster than expected.  Still, in the staff forecast the housing market is left with a relatively high level of inventory at the end of 2008, and prices are still elevated relative to rents, suggesting the possibility of greater declines in activity and prices.  In addition, equity prices are vulnerable to disappointing earnings as labor costs rise even gradually. The economy is most likely to grow a little below its potential for a while and inflation to trend gradually lower.  All in all, this is a pretty good outcome following the earlier oil price shock and rise in core inflation and housing market correction.  With demand outside of housing as resilient as it has been and inflation as high as it has persisted, the extent and trajectory of the expected inflation trend is uncertain and should remain our focus.  A failure of inflation to reverse the uptick of earlier this year before it becomes embedded in higher inflation expectations continues to be the main risk to good, sustained economic performance over time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"258";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’d actually like to start with a plea based on something that President Fisher said.  I’d like to be treated like a welder.  Can I get a show-up bonus?  [Laughter],   As everyone has said, there has been relatively little information to change people’s outlook fundamentally.  We have the same sort of tension that we’ve had before—slowing growth but persistent inflation.  Although we see some signs that inflation is coming down, it is still persisting at a higher level than many people, including me, would like it to be.  Despite the slowing housing market, private domestic final purchases continue to be reasonably robust.  The low third-quarter numbers in the Greenbook are really due to some volatile areas, some special factors:  inventories reflecting the weakness in the auto sector, some changes in the auto sector, and timing of defense purchases.  Net exports also tend to be fairly volatile. The suggestion is that maybe this low is just temporary, as the Greenbook has said.  Also, virtually everyone around the table has suggested that the labor markets are really quite robust. Exactly as Governor Warsh said, some of the recent numbers suggest that compensation is on the rise, although the ECI is still not quite as robust as some of the other measures.  Certainly we could have a benign scenario in which the continuing high profit margins absorb some of these higher labor costs without necessarily leading to higher price pressures down the line.  But the high equity markets may also be supporting high demand, or the recent increases in the equity markets could be to some extent offsetting the decreasing wealth effects from the housing market.  Obviously, there could be a tension if the markets start to come down and profits aren’t quite as robust as people have been projecting.  We also may have other temporary factors that seem to be boosting domestic final purchases—the decline in prices for oil, natural gas, and gasoline.  I hope that the lower prices will persist, but certainly the energy sector is extremely volatile with prices moving around enormously; and as a number of people mentioned, there are a lot of potential problems down the line that could lead to higher energy prices.  One thing that didn’t lead to higher energy prices this year was a very benign climate.  We had unusually good weather this year.  Last year and the previous year, we had unusually bad weather.  So I don’t know whether a number of factors are just making us have a bit of luck right now and are perhaps temporarily boosting demand. What does this mean for inflation?  As we always say, there are transitory factors, and there are more likely to be permanent factors.  We’ve talked about some measurement issues with respect to owners’ equivalent rent—probably that’s something transitory.  We’re certainly not certain about that.  As for energy shocks, we have very little evidence that there has been a lot of feed-through from energy shocks to core inflation, and as a number of people mentioned, I don’t think we can rely too much on the decline in energy to say, “Well, it didn’t get there on the way up, but it will help us on the way down.”  I don’t see a good basis for relying on that asymmetry.  There is the standard output gap story, but from discussions around the table and certainly from the Greenbook, I think there is not an enormous output gap to rely on to bring inflation down, even if one believed that that gap has an important effect—and there is vanishing evidence that it has an important effect. Then there’s the role of expectations in the economic models—the multiple equilibriums story.  Just our markets’ belief that inflation will be relatively low going forward affects price-setting behavior, which affects the willingness of consumers to pay more for goods and services.  That leaves us with a benign but very fragile scenario.  As we know, with any so-called multiple equilibriums situation, it’s not clear exactly what is driving expectations.  Obviously, part is their belief in the people around this table, which is something that is incredibly important; it’s something that we really need to maintain, but something that we don’t understand very well.  In these five weeks, we haven’t had much change in the fundamentals, but I am left just as uncomfortable about really understanding the inflation situation, the short-run inflation dynamics, because we have an output gap approach, an energy shocks approach, an expectations approach, and sort of a measurement approach with owners’ equivalent rent. I take a bit of each of these, and there has been a lot of discussion of the different ones around the table; but I don’t think we have a good, overarching view of what is driving inflation, what the key inflation factors are.  For me, that’s one of the most worrisome things going forward because I find it hard to put all of them into a consistent framework.  It would be valuable for us to think a great deal about that.  Certainly, it may come up in the discussion of the communication strategy, but it’s something that I’m trying to face more and have found it more difficult to understand. We’re going to get an enormous amount of information.  We have holiday retail sales coming up, so we’re going to find out a lot about consumption.  We have two employment reports coming up.  We have two rounds of ISM, preliminary revised GDP, ECI, and a lot of information on the housing market.  We’ll probably find out a lot more, because in the colder areas the housing market tends to slow down naturally.  The seasonal is very strong there.  So we should know from some of the data in December whether the numbers from permits, which suggest that the housing market is continuing to go down, or the starts numbers, which seem to be flattening out, show where we are likely to be at the beginning of next year.  There’s a lot of uncertainty with respect to both the economy and inflation.  In particular, my inflation concerns come from not having an overarching way of understanding whether the factors that we talk about as temporary are really going to be temporary.  Thank you."
"259";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District survey for October just released today shows manufacturing flattening out after a run-up last month, though expectations remain upbeat.  Services firms note solid increases in revenues, and overall District job growth remains strong.  Among retailers, big-ticket sales were softer, and housing-related sales slowed further; but with other retailers, the picture brightened, with sales and traffic notably stronger. The housing sector continues to slow, with sales weakening further in the D.C. area and modest price reductions occurring in other large markets.  Some cities in the Carolinas, however, continue to report modest increases in home sales prices and even permits, and in many locations, activity varies significantly across different price ranges.  District labor markets remain tight, and our surveys indicate that expectations are for some additional wage pressures in the next six months.  This commentary includes the now-usual reports of shortages of particular skills.  Our price measures moderated some, but they remain elevated. The national outlook has changed only marginally in the past five weeks.  At our last few meetings, we have seen the staff mark down their forecast for second-half growth as the pace of the contraction in housing activity has become clear.  The information that has come in over the past several weeks does not suggest any steepening in the rate of decline, and if anything, there are scattered signs suggesting that we might be getting close to the bottom.  Except for housing, the economy still appears to be in good shape.  Consumer spending is holding up well. Employment is tracking labor force growth.  Commercial construction is fairly robust, and business investment spending continues to grow.  So we’re still not seeing any major spillovers from the housing market to other economic sectors.  Housing is certainly going to subtract from headline growth over the next couple of quarters, but I expect GDP growth to return to close to potential at some point next year, and I remain more optimistic than the staff about when that will occur.  There is a risk that output growth will come in lower than I anticipate because of a more severe deterioration of the housing markets or more substantial spillover effects on other spending categories.  Although it’s certainly too early to rule this out, I think the probability of such an outcome has receded in recent weeks.  So my outlook for real growth is about the same as it was in September with, if anything, a tad less downside risk. The inflation outlook has not improved since our last meeting.  The September core CPI reading was 2.9 at an annual rate, identical to the August reading, and core PCE inflation for September is estimated at an annual rate of about 2.1 percent, I think.  I grant that three-month core PCE inflation has come down off its May peak of close to 3 percent.  I do take some comfort in the fact that core inflation did not remain so high, but that measure of inflation has been right about 2¼ percent for three straight months.  The Greenbook forecast has it stepping up to 2.4 percent for the next six months and falling below 2.2 percent only in the second quarter of 2008.  So three-month core PCE inflation is now as low as it gets for the next year and a half in the Greenbook forecast, and at the end of 2008, core inflation will have been above 2 percent for five straight years. I have my doubts about the prospects for even the modest decline described in the Greenbook.  The notion that slowing real growth will bring inflation down much has already been heavily discounted around this table—and rightly so, in my view, given the tenuous status of the relationship between real gaps and inflation.  The recent fall in energy prices may help, but relying on tame energy prices is problematic, I think.  It would encourage the public to believe that we will allow core inflation to rise whenever energy prices surge.  That belief is, for me, the leading hypothesis explaining the run-ups in core inflation that we saw last fall and earlier this year.  We are likely to see some significant swings in energy prices in the years ahead.  So help from this direction is by no means certain.  More broadly, I believe we should be leery of letting a relative price move core inflation around. There was a lot of discussion at our last meeting about the state of inflation expectations, and a number of people pointed to evidence that market participants did not seem to believe we intend to bring inflation down to the center of the 1 to 2 percent range.  This is confirmed by the Bluebook, which provides a very useful compilation this time from various sources of market expectations for core PCE inflation, and they are all clustered around 2¼ percent.  If the Greenbook forecast is realized and core inflation gradually comes down to 2.1 percent over the next two years, it’s hard to believe these expectations would fall much.  So with core inflation running around 2¼ percent and not likely to come down much soon and with expectations apparently settled at about the same rate, I’m deeply concerned about inflation.  Thank you."
"260";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I see it, the data have actually been coming in very much along the lines of where we were at the last meeting in terms of the outlook.  The only way that I would change my view slightly is actually good news, in that I see somewhat less downside potential than I saw at the last meeting.  In particular, I think that the housing market, although it has retrenched a lot, which I actually consider a rebalancing of the economy, does not look as though it’s going to collapse in a nonlinear way.  For example, we see that the market has some expectations along those lines—for example, the stock prices of builders have actually come back a substantial amount.  We also see that consumers seem to be holding up very well.  The real danger that we were worried about in terms of a housing market retrenchment is that it would spill over in a nonlinear way to the household sector.  We don’t see any evidence of that either.  Consumer confidence is staying strong.  The stock market is up— again, an indication that these spillover effects are not occurring over and above those that we think would be normal in terms of wealth effects and so forth.  So, for me, there is actually some good news here in that the possibility of a soft landing has actually increased.  My view of where the economy is heading has not undergone a major change, but I have a bit less in the downside tails than I had before. The characterization of a deceleration of core PCE inflation also seems to be a very reasonable one.  I think the evidence is moving in that direction.  But I do want to emphasize that I see no reason that core PCE inflation will fall below 2 percent.  We see that inflation expectations are solidly grounded.  The good news in that has been that we had an increase in energy prices and we did not see an acceleration of inflation expectations.  However, the numbers there are around 2½ percent on the CPI, and that’s consistent with a 2 percent PCE deflator inflation.  When we think about going out past the two years, I do see deceleration along the lines of the Greenbook.  I don’t see anything more encouraging after that.  Talking about the issue of potentially less persistence does not tell us, in fact, that inflation should fall below what inflation expectations are anchored at.  So thank you very much."
"261";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Seventh District appear to be quite similar to what I reported last time.  Except for housing and autos, activity remains on a solid footing, and most of our contacts are relatively optimistic about the outlook.  For instance, the two large temp firms we talk to regularly both reported that, although billable hours were roughly flat, their clients were upbeat about the outlook.  Furthermore, demand for workers in light industry—the segment most closely tied to the national business cycle—continued to grow.  In terms of wages, both temp firms noted that compensation increases have been running much higher than last year at this time.  The difficulties of the Big Three automakers continue to be a problem for our region and are showing through in the national numbers for the third quarter.  These difficulties don’t stem from an overall lack of demand.  Light vehicle sales continue to run at a pretty healthy pace, as the Greenbook notes.  To some extent, the Big Three’s difficulties are a consequence of the energy price shock.  Demand has shifted away from pickups and big SUVs, which have been their bread and butter.  Despite the recent gas price declines, Ford and GM told us that they do not expect a reversal of this shift anytime soon. Otherwise, the District is doing reasonably well.  I heard a lot of optimism.  Indeed, a few contacts explicitly described the current slowdown as similar to the brief pause in the mid-1990s, which was followed by sustained expansion. Turning to the national outlook, clearly economic activity was soft during the third quarter, but the fairly solid growth in consumption and business fixed investment indicates that at least to date we have not seen a spillover of the weakness in housing to other sectors of the economy.  This is consistent with the anecdotes that I’m hearing.  Looking ahead, we expect several quarters of weak residential investment, but activity in other sectors should increase roughly in line with longer-run sustainable rates.  Assuming market expectations for interest rates, we see GDP growth averaging modestly below potential over the next year and a half.  We think growth will be a bit above potential in ’08.  In our view, the underlying fundamentals— wealth, income, interest rates, and the current level of liquidity in the economy—should support a higher level of spending than what’s in the Greenbook baseline. Of course, a major risk for our outlook is that there could be more-substantial spillovers from the housing sector.  As has been noted around this table, it could take some time for the weakness in housing demand to show through to house prices.  I was hoping we could get more information, but it sounds as though the research isn’t there yet.  If prices do fall substantially, a reduction in wealth could have serious ramifications for consumption and spending overall.  It’s hard to say when we’ll have a clearer picture as to how events are unfolding.  At some point, probably before the decline in the broad measures of housing prices, we’ll likely see early evidence in either anecdotes or risk spreads.  Or if the risk is overstated, we may hear of improvements from our contacts. Turning to inflation, the projections from our models have not changed much with the incoming data.  They still show core PCE inflation in ’08 coming in between 2.3 and 2.6 percent, depending on the period used to estimate the models.  So I continue to have the same questions I had last time regarding the interplay between such inflation rates, inflation expectations, and Fed credibility:  Will continued high levels of core inflation eventually make the public doubt our resolve to maintain low and stable inflation?  Even if inflation is less persistent, as some have suggested, will it settle out at rates like those in the past few years—namely, 2 percent—rather than the 1.6 percent in the Greenbook’s less-persistent inflation scenario?  Are the current long-run core PCE inflation expectations, which are likely above 2 percent, just simply too high? I’m quite concerned that the answers to these questions might be “yes.”  If so, and the housing spillover risks fade, then we may have to act more forcefully than the Greenbook baseline policy assumption in order to ensure that inflation is more clearly headed into the range consistent with price stability.,   My general assessment has been that this is a market share story.  It’s not a story of aggregate demand for automobiles or light vehicles in that it is a shift from the domestic, what we used to call the Big Three, to foreign manufacturers, whether they’re producing here in the United States or exporting more to the United States.  Obviously, we know there has been a big ramp-up in transplants here, but the import share of light vehicles is going up, too.  So I generally think it’s a market share story and, as you said, there will be a lot of dislocations if, God forbid, Ford goes out of business.  But I think it would just be a shift. Now, in terms of whether what’s happening at Ford is, as you said, a death spiral, I really wouldn’t know.  A new CEO is coming in, and there is the old adage, “When a new CEO comes in, he’s going to write off as much as he possibly can and get it behind him.”  So some of that may be occurring as well.  But the problem with the U.S. firms is both the product they have and the perception of that product.  I think their product has gotten better.  I don’t, personally, think it’s as good as the foreign firms’ product, but I think the perception of it is much worse than the perception of the foreign firms’ product.,   Slightly.,   No, I saw it coming down—oh, you mean in the outer years.  Well, I think several things are going on.  There is still the spillover of energy price increases flowing through the economy, but also there are more resource constraints than are built into the baseline forecast."
"262";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our regional economic story is similar to that of the national economy.  Regional activity has slowed in the third quarter, mainly because of the housing sector.  In general, our business contacts expect the regional economy to continue to expand, albeit at a modest pace.  Price pressures remain elevated in the Third District but have not strengthened over the intermeeting period. Turning to the individual sectors, manufacturing activity in our region has softened over the past two months.  The index of general economic activity in our business outlook survey, which turned slightly negative last month, remains slightly negative this month, indicating basically not much change since September.  However, there were some positives in the October survey that were not in the September report.  In particular, there was a rebound in the indexes of new orders and shipments, suggesting slightly positive growth in our respondents’ firms.  Also, manufacturing executives were much more optimistic this month about future activity, with most indicators rebounding from their September low readings.  This optimism is consistent with President Moskow’s comment about the optimism of some executives that he has observed. Now, consistent with the slowdown in activity, payroll employment growth in our three states slowed in the third quarter to an annual rate of about 0.7 percent, compared with 1.1 percent in the nation.  The unemployment rate, which had been running under the national rate for the past three years, has now moved up to that rate.  Still, our business contacts as well as respondents to our manufacturing survey continue to cite difficulty in finding qualified workers as one of their major business concerns. As in the nation, the housing sector in our region continues to decline.  We’ve seen some slowing in the value of nonresidential contracts as well over the past three months.  But these data are quite noisy, and I think it’s too early to read much of a turning point into the nonresidential construction sector for our region at this point.  Office vacancy rates continue to edge down, and the net absorption of office space continues to be positive. Consumer spending continues to hold up well in our region.  We saw a pickup in retail sales in September, except for autos.  Area retailers told us that their sales had increased in recent weeks, and their back-to-school sales exceeded their expectations.  Their view is that continued growth at that pace depended on consumer confidence, which for the mid-Atlantic region increased in September, no doubt because of the decline in oil prices. The Fed’s current economic activity indexes indicate a slowing in activity in our region over the past three months, especially in New Jersey, which has shown the sharpest deceleration. As of August, year-to-date average growth in these indexes (weighted by gross state product) for our three states has been about 1.8 percent, compared with 3 percent for the United States.  Over the past three months, regional growth has slowed to about 0.6 percent.  The leading indicators for our three states also have moved down this year, suggesting only modest growth over the coming six to nine months. On the inflation front, consumer prices in the Philadelphia region continue to rise at a pace faster than that of the nation.  The faster pace is due mainly to the larger increases in shelter prices in the Philadelphia metro area compared with those in the United States.  On a more positive note, while area manufacturers continue to report higher production costs, these cost increases have been less widespread in recent surveys than earlier in the year.  The index of prices paid in our manufacturing survey has declined for the past three months, and the index of prices received was down significantly in October.  So while the levels of these indexes remain high, indicating continued inflationary pressures, some solace may be found in the less elevated levels of these indicators, at least in recent months. For the national economy, my outlook is not much different from what it was at the last meeting.  Real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised down to 2.6 percent, as has been noted, and the data received to date suggest that growth in the third quarter was even weaker, perhaps 1 to 1½ percent.  I expect some rebound in the fourth quarter and, like President Minehan, was pleased to see the upward revision in the fourth-quarter forecast in the Greenbook. The main source of the slowdown, of course, is the fall in the demand for housing. Manufacturing also softened in the third quarter compared with its robust pace earlier in the year. About half of that slowdown was due to autos, and I expect some rebound there, too, in the fourth quarter.  Trade subtracted from growth in the third quarter relative to the second quarter, but again, as has been pointed out, I expect that to be less of a drag in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. So aside from housing, most other sectors of the economy, including consumer spending and business investment, are holding up, even in the Philadelphia region in the Third District. They aren’t growing as rapidly as they were in the first part of this year, but they are growing somewhat below trend, and they continue to expand.  If the slowdown in housing continues to be an orderly one, without large spillovers as has been frequently mentioned, I would not characterize that correction as unwelcome.  Housing activity has been at an unsustainably high pace in recent years.  Of course, at this point we cannot rule out the possibility that the correction in housing from the unsustainably high pace of activity that we’ve seen over the past few years will derail the expansion.  But so far, we have not seen spillovers of housing into other sectors. In particular, we have not seen any retrenchment by the consumer for the most part.  The moderation we’ve seen in consumer spending after the strong first quarter is largely in line with expectations.  Real disposable income growth remains healthy, and we have been lucky with two positives—the decline in gasoline prices and the rise in the stock market. We’ve had some hopeful news on the inflation front over the intermeeting period, but the level of inflation continues to concern me.  As we anticipated at the time of our last meeting, the drop in energy prices led to a significant deceleration in headline inflation for September. Although the twelve-month change in core CPI actually edged up to 2.9 percent, a rate that I consider well above price stability, it may be beginning to stabilize.  But, frankly, a lot of uncertainty remains, and it is dangerous, to my mind, to rely too heavily on one month’s numbers.  Some of the acceleration of core inflation over the past year was likely due to the pass-through from energy prices, as we discussed before.  So if oil prices fall or continue to stabilize, then acceleration of core inflation from this source will likely dissipate.  However, we’ve seen energy prices retreat only to move back up again, so I don’t think we should become too sanguine.  Indeed, the inflation picture remains uncertain.  I’ll be more comfortable when we begin to see twelve-month core inflation begin to decelerate.  To the extent that some of the acceleration in inflation was fueled by very accommodative monetary policy over the past five years, we still need to consider whether monetary policy has firmed enough to remove the cumulative effects of the past policy accommodation to get inflation back down to a level consistent with price stability in a reasonable time so that our credibility is not at risk.  The longer we allow that deviation from price stability to persist, the higher the risk to our credibility and the higher the risk that recent high inflation readings will raise longer-term inflationary expectations.  So far, long-run expectations have been stable, and shorter-run expectations have fallen with oil prices.  Nevertheless, I think the Fed’s commitment to price stability deserves our protection.  One thing to note going forward, though, is that if economic growth remains below trend for a while, then there’s an implicit firming of monetary policy, even without changing the nominal interest rate.  Given our economic outlook and the risks to that outlook, at this point that may be actually the most desirable path.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"263";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start by saying that I think the Greenbook outlook is a very good central tendency outlook.  I am going to make some comments that are more on the downside of that, which come from hunches and gut instinct.  I want to emphasize that I don’t want to make policy on the basis of gut instinct, but I think it helps to keep an open mind about some of the things that might be going on. First, on the positive side, my UPS contact says that he is expecting a peak season with a glut of volume and not enough lift.  They’re going to have to move express business over to trucks. So if you’re counting on getting a last minute present at Christmastime, I urge you to order a little earlier than you might otherwise.  That’s his expectation.  On the labor side, UPS has some fairly big increases coming next year as a consequence of recent contracts they signed.  They had a long negotiation with pilots, but on the ground side, obviously the less skilled workers, they’re expecting about 3½ percent compensation, very much in line with a normal situation. My Wal-Mart contact said that they have not experienced the pickup in sales that they would have anticipated from the decline in energy prices.  They had expected an increase of about 65 basis points.  They always measure their sales as same-store, year over year.  They haven’t seen that.  They’re going to be lucky to get 2 percent year-over-year in October.  My contact says that weekly information suggests that October is slowing down week by week as we go through the month.  Wal-Mart received a lot of attention recently in the press about their slowdown in building new stores next year.  They probably had a lot more press than the actual size of the slowdown warrants.  They are expecting to increase their square footage 7.6 percent in ’07 compared with 8.4 percent in ’06—so the slowdown is hardly gigantic.  Construction costs this year are rising 17 percent; next year they’re anticipating 11 to 12 percent.  So there is a slowdown in the increase, but 11 to 12 percent is still a pretty big increase in construction costs. My contact in the trucking industry says—and this may make a little more explicit what Richard Fisher was saying—that things in the industry are continuing to slow down.  He says it’s the first time in his experience—and he’s been with the company twenty years or more—that the seasonal peak has not yet started.  Ordinarily the seasonal peak in shipping for the holiday shopping season would have started.  It just hasn’t started, and I think he said they’re running—I forget exactly what the number was—8 percent below a year ago.  (Incidentally, one thing that I was thinking when Richard was talking was that sometimes the business people have a hard time doing the seasonal adjustment, so when you compare the third quarter with the second quarter, they may not be seeing a seasonally adjusted slowdown because the volume is bigger in the third than in the second.)  My trucking industry contact says that the slower business seems pretty evenly distributed geographically—perhaps a greater softness in the Southeast than in other parts of the country.  It is more concentrated in home improvement—I think Home Depot is one of the big customers—and probably autos, but the softness is spread fairly generally across commodity categories. We’ve also spent a lot of time talking recently with contacts in the housing industry.  The word that we’re getting is that some of the smaller and even regional builders have perhaps six months, and if they don’t see a pickup, they’re going to be filing for bankruptcy.  They are very, very hard pressed.  A lot of them overbuilt.  They are stuck with a big inventory.  They have the carrying costs of that inventory, and laying off workers doesn’t solve that problem.  They may bring the new construction down very low, but it doesn’t solve the problem of what to do with the unsold inventory.  So without a pickup in housing, I think we can anticipate some bankruptcy filings in that area. People around the table here and, I think, generally have been treating oil price declines as an unambiguous positive, and I would like to raise a caution flag on that.  I remember from my first year in graduate school Milton Friedman pounding into me that a price never declines without a shift in either the supply curve or the demand curve.  Over and over again, that’s what Friedman would say.  Now, on the supply side in oil, as far as I know, there have been no gigantic new supplies that have come on the market, and the optimistic view on oil is that last winter and spring or starting in the fall perhaps a year ago, there was maybe a $10 to $20 premium built into crude on the basis of geopolitical and weather uncertainties.  So a possibility is that prices in the mid to upper seventies were above what was clearing current supply and demand.  Inventories accumulated—we know that there has been a big inventory accumulation in the United States for sure—and eventually, with nothing really bad happening on the geopolitical front and with no hurricanes hitting, the prices dropped back down.  It seems to me that is the optimistic way of looking at what’s happened to oil prices.  But I think we should not rule out the possibility that some fundamental weakness in world demand is showing up in the demand for energy and that might have something to do with the softness.  I take that as a hunch, not by any means as a certainty; but I think we ought to be open to that possibility. Clearly, the yield curve has been inverted for quite a few months.  The market seems to be quite persistent in believing that some time next year there are going to be some declines in short-term interest rates, presumably because of some combination of slower real growth and more-benign inflation.  Possibly it’s not all expectations related.  It may simply be that the underlying demand for funds is softening—that’s surely true in the mortgage and housing industry—and that is what’s driving yields down.  So I think that it’s important to keep an open mind to the possibility that a more fundamental slowing than we see in the current numbers is taking place and to make sure that we don’t dismiss incoming data and say it can’t really be happening.  Thank you."
"264";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We had a meeting at the Bank last week with representatives from the housing industry in the Twin Cities, including builders, brokers, and lenders, and most of these participants operate nationally.  In fact, one of the first you mentioned, Richard, was there.  Some of these firms are in nonresidential development and construction as well.  The bottom line of the meeting, I would say, was that the comments overall track pretty well with the Greenbook forecast of housing activity—that is, both a further and a prolonged slump in housing.  Let me just give you a few of the specifics.  They reported, as we know, that sales of new homes have declined dramatically and prices of new homes are going down with sales, also dramatically.  Retail brokerages are starting to contract in terms of both number of offices and number of brokers.  It was reported that so-called investors have disappeared entirely from many markets and that inventories of unsold homes are rising and the extent of the increase may be understated by the published data.  There was little expectation among this group of improvement in housing in the next several months at least, and I would say not a whole heck of a lot of confidence that there was improvement in store even out beyond that, maybe as you get later into ’07.  In contrast, and on a somewhat more positive note, the people who are also in nonresidential construction—in particular, office and retail development—thought that the outlook was promising, indeed positive, and are seeing a lot of activity in that business. The housing situation notwithstanding, I remain somewhat more optimistic about our prospects for real growth both in ’07 and in ’08 than the Greenbook.  Apparently my assessment of the implications of the sustained increase in income, of the run-up in equity values, and of the decline in energy prices is just more positive than the Greenbook’s, and that’s how I arrive at a somewhat more optimistic assessment.  I continue to think that core inflation will diminish modestly over this period.  So my overall view of the outlook really has changed very little since the last meeting."
"265";"MR. STOCKTON.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  It’s amazing how great my answers are to your questions at 3 o’clock in the morning after an FOMC meeting.  [Laughter]  I want to address just a couple of things that came up during the question-and-answer session. First, on the issue that President Yellen raised about the expectational channel.  That’s a pretty small piece of the story in the way that these model simulations work, so I don’t think you should worry too much that it is being a significant factor.  It is a small factor slowing the pace of disinflation.  The model guys tell me that the dollar channel is probably the more important factor there. Second, in response to President Moskow’s question about house-price modeling, I should have said we do have several models of house-price determination, none of which we think are very good.  [Laughter]  One is an error-correction model that takes seriously the notion that, when house prices are very high relative to rents, there’s a correction that will bring the price-rent ratio back to the historical average, and we estimate the speed of that correction.  That model taken seriously would suggest outright house-price declines in 2007 and 2008.  We also have a simpler model based on momentum.  That model suggests a bit of deceleration but nowhere near the amount of deceleration suggested by the error-correction model.  Our forecast cuts between those two simply as an indication of our ignorance about which of those models might be best at capturing the current situation. Third, in response to President Pianalto’s question, besides the notion that the less-persistence scenario could reflect greater credibility anchoring monetary policy, some structural changes could be taking place in the economy in terms of greater flexibility of labor markets and maybe greater price flexibility as well.  I don’t think that’s an unreasonable hypothesis.  One could think about and be surprised at the extent to which workers have taken a significant hit to their real wage this time without trying to recoup any of it through higher nominal wages.  That may indicate that labor markets and maybe product markets are changing in a way that will make the overall inflation adjustment more rapid than the inertia models that underlie our staff projections.  I hope those responses are a little clearer.  I’ll sleep better tonight. [Laughter]  Thank you."
"266";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My own views are quite consistent with what I expressed five weeks ago and with the central tendency of many of the speakers today—that is, a greater concern about inflation prospects than growth prospects.  So I thought what I’d do is just give you maybe three or four perspectives on market activity in the intermeeting period and suggest to you what conclusions we can draw from them and what conclusions I’d hesitate to draw. First, as we noted at the last meeting, the growth in the equity markets is all about earnings and not about multiples.  As the markets record the eighteenth double-digit quarterly growth rate, with quarterly growth in the third quarter likely to exceed, on an annualized basis, the second quarter, on one level you would see reasons for earnings momentum and for more robustness than the Greenbook shows in the prospect for business fixed investment.  Despite those headlines, I think the Greenbook probably has the general slowdown in business fixed investment and the general slowdown in manufacturing about right.  Again, at some superficial level you would think that these stock prices would be juicing business activity—that animal spirits would be as high as they’ve ever been.  But in fact, what we can say with some confidence is that historical models of cash and profits have done a poor job of indicating what the strength of business demand would be here.  Although business demand has certainly picked up over this cycle, it appears not to have picked up as dramatically as a lot of the data might suggest. So what does that mean?  I think it means that there is generally still conservatism in board rooms, conservatism by CFOs.  Although they have plenty of ammunition in terms of their access to capital markets and their cash balances, we’ll likely see them use that only when it’s clear that the economy has turned.  If this soft landing followed by a gradual acceleration does appear to be the most likely path, I would expect to see these companies put their feet on the accelerator a bit more and make sure that growth gets back to trend relatively quickly.  But the idea that businesses are going to turbo-charge their way through this without hesitation appears to be less likely than the data would suggest. Second, let me turn to the debt markets.  There is a discussion among pundits about a tug of war going on between growth risks and inflation risks.  As I look at the data in the debt markets, I must say that I don’t see that tug of war.  The only tug of war is really between a soft landing and a harder landing, under the view that inflation is almost assuredly going to be solved by the central bank or by exogenous factors.  Again, a superficial conclusion would be, boy, the markets are not worried about inflation, and we should take great comfort in it.  Rather, the thing that gives me the greatest pause is that, just as inflation is nowhere on the table in the capital markets now, it could quickly emerge; and it would not take much data, which all of us would consider to be relatively noisy and perhaps not overly valid, for inflation to become part of the discussion in the debt markets.  That’s something I think we have to prepare for.  I suspect, as I think about the balance of this year, that another round of discussions in the capital markets about an inflation scare is quite possible. The third issue is really one of short-term volatility, which I tend not to overreact to, but I do think this particular case is telling.  Typically, several weeks after a quarter, the markets’ assessment of that quarter’s GDP ends up trending toward truth and ends up without a huge disparity as they get closer to and smarter about the underlying information.  I have no reason to doubt our own staff’s view that third-quarter GDP is likely to come in around 1 percent. Nonetheless, the markets’ estimates are quite far away from that.  Market estimates have, in fact, trended down, but I’d say the median estimate in the market is still in the high ones, maybe even 2 percent.  So the question really is, come Friday, if the headline number posts the way that the staff suggests it will, what the market will say about that.  My own view is that there will then be an immediate rush to judgment probably amplified to the downside in a political season like this. They will say, “Boy, the economy is really on the wrong track, and the economic landing is a very hard one.”  Whether that judgment dissipates as markets look forward and start to understand the reasons for the shortfall is a bit of a concern.  Also, some in the marketplace may have the view that, if that landing is relatively hard and fast, the pace of economic growth will do our work for us on the inflation front.  Obviously I don’t think that view is shared by many of us around the table; in fact, there might be more work for us to do.  It wouldn’t surprise me if the markets didn’t, at the end of this period, expect there to be a couple of rate cuts built into the first half of 2007, and I suspect we’ll need to send Don back out there to give them another speech. [Laughter],   What does all of this mean for the real economy?  Again, I’d break it up into two pieces.  First, in terms of a consumer reaction function, I think consumers are going to be very stubborn and very strong and are not going to be overly scared by a third-quarter GDP number that they don’t really pay that much attention to.  On a very fundamental level they are feeling much better about their prospects now than they have felt in some time, this is a function of some of the wage growth that we’ve seen and a function of oil prices and the unemployment rate.  So I don’t really worry that there will be any short or intermediate effect on the consumer. I think the Greenbook has consumer spending continuing in the fourth quarter at something like 3 percent.  That’s probably a very conservative estimate given the strength of some of those underlying fundamentals.  Second, what’s the effect of this on the real economy for businesses? I’m more concerned about their reaction function.  Despite the rather robust discussion in the business sector that I mentioned at the outset, I would expect them to be concerned.  As they’re thinking about their capital expenditures plans for 2007 and as they’re doing their fiscal year-end meetings, on balance the concern and the discussion of a hard landing may well affect their ability to bet big and make big projects.  So, again, I share the rather conservative view that the staff expressed in the Greenbook in terms of where business investment is going to be. Finally, let me just talk for a moment about inflation—again in the context of these market perspectives.  I tried to be as witty as David is in this discussion, and during the break it occurred to me that I should call this section “Inflation: Are Objects in Mirror Larger than They Appear?”  [Laughter]  That’s my half-hearted effort at humor.  I’ve probably talked about the TIPS markets at least as much as other folks around this table in the past six or seven months, and I do find some comfort in them.  But I find myself increasingly viewing them as being a bit divorced from some of the data.  My view is that expectations of inflation relevant for price setting may have deteriorated much more substantially than the TIPS markets and the survey measures suggest.  I think the Greenbook has an alternative simulation that hits this case well, and its conclusion has to be that expectations may account for more of this year’s rise in core inflation than either we or the markets estimate.  Inflation is likely going to be particularly sticky in the labor markets, given my discussion a moment ago.  Very low unemployment insurance claims, very low unemployment, and strong wage and job growth make me believe that the labor market may actually be tightening at the same time that everything else we’ve talked about is happening in the housing markets.  The revision from BLS suggested that they found 810,000 jobs through March.  When all is said and done about the subsequent six-month period, they may have found more jobs as well, bolstering the case that the labor markets may, in fact, be quite tight.  Total compensation is up about 8.3 percent, the fastest rate since the third quarter of 2000. Average hourly earnings have accelerated now to 4 percent.  At the end of the day, we should take some comfort from the TIPS spreads, but not reliance.  As we think about the measure of TIPS spreads as an indication of inflation expectations, I am troubled, probably increasingly, that the TIPS markets appear to be following our forecast rather than the actual data, and we have to continue to address that problem proactively with the markets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"267";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, again, as some of you have said, in five weeks we don’t have a whole lot of new information.  But I’m coming back and starting with housing again.  As you know, that continues to be something I watch.  Let me just make a few comments and give you recent feedback from some exams and dialogues with brokers that I’d like to share with you.  Looking at both starts and permits, we all know that housing is continuing to soften in terms of construction, and we have also identified the increasing number of contract cancellations for new housing.  Someone mentioned earlier the noise that we may be having around housing data, and I get this through some of the anecdotal conversations that I’ve had with folks.  One topic was the inventory of existing housing for sale.  I’m hearing from a couple of real estate brokers that people who may have wanted to sell their homes or may have put them up for sale are withdrawing them from the market.  They don’t need to move, and it isn’t worthwhile for them to move if they don’t get the price they want.  I think the supply was possibly bigger than what we’re really measuring, and so we’re seeing some understating of what desired house sales would be in terms of inventory.  That’s continuing; it is just beginning at this stage, at least in a couple of regions, according to folks with whom I’ve talked. One of the challenges that we’re faced with here is that—again, I try to look for the good news—in the housing purchase process, people file applications for mortgages very often before they qualify to buy the house.  When you look at the Mortgage Bankers Association data on purchase mortgage applications, as I mentioned before, they dropped 20 percent from their peak of last summer, but in the past few months they have been leveling off.  So if applications are a leading indicator, we may begin to see some moderation in housing purchases.  However, the 20 percent drop in purchase mortgage applications means that mortgage brokers are earning a lot less income.  If they don’t close a transaction, most of them get no paycheck because three out of four mortgages are originated not in financial institutions but by independent brokers.  We’re beginning to see increasing evidence of this in terms of the quality of mortgages that are out there.  We continue to track the mortgages that have vintages—in other words, that were originated—in 2005, and we are continuing to see that, as these mortgages age, the early delinquencies for these are greater than early delinquencies for similar-aged mortgages of earlier vintages, which implies a loosening of underwriting standards and more stress on the borrowers. We are also seeing in a small way increased predatory activity with loans.  Certain practices have been described to me lately with new products, such as the 2-28 mortgage, which is fixed for two years and then escalates and becomes an ARM tied to LIBOR in the third year. But don’t worry—you can refinance it with the broker and bring your payment down and do it all over again.  We’re seeing those kinds of things—mortgages for which people are being qualified by brokers with no escrow account; all of a sudden taxes are due, and borrowers don’t have the money for them.  So predatory lending is rearing its head at the lower end of the scale, and it’s something we have to continue to watch for.  However, before I leave housing, let me just say that the bottom line is that overall mortgage credit quality is still very, very strong. We’re seeing predatory lending only in pockets of the market. I continue to believe that the rest of the economy—except for autos, I should add—is still very strong.  Consumer spending is good, and business fixed investment is very sound.  The moderation in energy prices and the growth in consumer income will continue to add support to the economy going forward.  Jobless claims have been low and moving in a very narrow range the past few months.  As several of you have mentioned, I’m hearing more concern by corporate executives about the inability to hire the talent they need to meet their business plans, and so I’m seeing more indication of tightness in labor markets. Turning to inflation, as many of you have said, core inflation has moderated from the pace in the third quarter.  But going forward in the Greenbook forecast, it is still showing significant persistence even though we think we will be growing, at least for a period, below potential.  That concerns me because that level is higher than I’m comfortable with in the long run.  We might have had some spillover effects from rising commodity and energy prices earlier on, but I was hoping at this point that, with the reversing, we would see more-positive spillover effects that would mitigate inflation.  So I am very worried about inflation.  At the same time, I know that negative spillover effects on growth due to the rapid decline in housing construction and the moderating house-price appreciation are risks, which we cannot dismiss, to growth; but on net I am still much more concerned about the persistence of inflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"268";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The New England District economy continues to grow at a moderate pace, pretty much as it was growing the last time we met, with job counts slowly increasing and business and consumer confidence relatively good about both current and future conditions.  As I’ve noted before, income growth has been robust in the District, with regional income growing better than 7 percent from second quarter ’05 to second quarter ’06.  Indeed, incomes in Massachusetts and Connecticut both rose about 9 percent. Reflecting this rise, the fiscal condition of the states in the region, while varied, remains positive. Regional corporate health is solid, and readings of regional stock indexes follow the positive pace of the nation’s financial markets.  Contacts from a wide range of manufacturing industries reported positive trends; fewer cost pressures from commodity, energy, and interest rates; and a continuation of competitive pressures to restrain costs and keep prices stable.  We regard this pressure as a return to business as usual. On the negative side, the slowdown in the housing sector becomes more apparent with each passing month.  According to the overall OFHEO house-price indexes, year-over-year appreciation in the second quarter of ’06 for New England was about half of that for the nation. The change from the first to the second quarter in ’06 was virtually zero.  The region now has the lowest rate of annual housing appreciation of any area of the country except the Midwest.  This situation is not entirely unwelcome, as housing price levels in the region remain quite high relative to the nation, and there has been much hand-wringing locally about the effect high housing costs have on attracting skilled labor to the region.  Of course, the cyclical effect of a sharp residential investment slowdown is of concern.  Existing home sales volumes are down 12 percent from their 2005 peaks.  New home construction is weakening significantly, and construction employment has declined in both Connecticut and Massachusetts since year-end 2005.  Indeed, negative commentary from area business contacts revolved mostly around markets for products aimed at the residential housing industry.  While there may be some light at the end of this tunnel, with recent lower mortgage interest rates and some sense of bottoming out, the usual seasonal slowdown in the real estate industry as winter approaches may make this improvement difficult to appreciate for some time. The effect of slowing residential investment remains one of the key uncertainties on the national scene as well.  Combined with the negative effect of trade, housing trends have caused us to mark down our estimate of third-quarter GDP growth to about the level of the Greenbook. However, positive incoming data on employment, consumer spending, and corporate profits, spurred as they have been by favorable trends in energy prices, financial markets, and worldwide growth, support a modest rebound in overall activity in the fourth quarter and a forecast for 2007 and 2008 of just slightly less than potential.  Indeed, I was pleased to see the upward revision to the Greenbook forecast for the fourth quarter of this year, as I had worried whether the earlier trajectory had increased the risk of a spiral downward into a recession.  I don’t think that’s likely, and I realize that overall the second-half GDP projection remains about the same.  But the upward revision to the fourth quarter in the Greenbook, which brings it closer to our Boston forecast, makes me somewhat more comfortable about the underlying trajectory of economic activity. We, like the Greenbook authors, have revised down slightly our estimate of potential, so our sense of any gap in resource usage remains about the same as it was at the last meeting. Thus, unemployment rises very slowly, to just about 5 percent in 2008, and inflation falls slowly as well, along the lines of the forecast at the last meeting.  All in all, that is not a lot of change.  I must admit, however, to some small amount of hope that we may be seeing the bottoming out of the housing market decline because of the mixture of the data that Dave referred to earlier. Moreover, other aspects of the current situation seem quite positive as well—in particular, the very accommodative nature of financial markets and the continuing profitability of the nation’s corporations.  Thus, the risks to what continues to be in many ways a rather benign forecast seem to me to be a bit less on the downside than they seemed at our last meeting.  Energy-driven inflation may be lower as well, but I remain concerned about the underlying pressures on resource utilization if the economy does not slow as much as we now expect.  Corporate-driven productivity growth, though we haven’t seen it escalate recently, could come to the rescue here, but I think it’s hard to bet on that.  Thus, I do see some continuing uncertainty as to whether inflation will be as well behaved as in either the Boston or the Greenbook forecast.,   Yes.  I just wanted to add something that I forgot to mention earlier. President Fisher’s comments reminded me of it.  Whether you look at the KMV data on expected- default frequencies for the five major homebuilders or at the Dow Jones home construction index and the stock prices for the top five homebuilders, none of them seems to be indicating a major problem.  Now, the expected-default frequency, which again is driven from stock prices, may certainly be above the rest of U.S. industry, but by no means is it even at any kind of historically medium position, let alone high position, and there has been a recent uptrend in the Dow Jones home construction index overall.  So that’s another bit of the data that I was using, and others may be using as well, to suggest that maybe things won’t get as bad as the worst of our projections in terms of homebuilding.,   Private equity interest, yes.  But not all five of them, and they all point in the same direction."
"269";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For a while now, I’ve been somewhat more pessimistic than most of the Committee about the downside risk to the real economy.  I was beginning to get worried that this might be the perpetual disposition of someone from Ohio. [Laughter]  As a prominent member of our business community said to me not too long ago, it’s not the weather, it’s the climate.  [Laughter] Since our last meeting, I’ve become more comfortable with the idea that substantially weaker-than-forecast growth is less probable—partly because we’re now a little further down the road without any signs that the worst-case scenarios are materializing and partly because my directors and my business contacts seem more positive about the economic outlook. Specifically, as I listened to some of my business contacts in construction, retail, and even real estate, the expectations that things will get substantially worse just aren’t there.  Also, the demand for labor seems to be growing at a moderate pace. On the price side, my contacts are not indicating much of an impetus for higher final goods prices.  Although projected compensation growth seems to be firming just a bit, my contacts are telling me that they think productivity gains will keep costs in check.  With the declining energy and material costs, I don’t hear much about the potential for accelerating pressures on prices. When I combine what I’m hearing from my District contacts with the aggregate data that have come in since our last meeting, I sense that we have weathered the worst in softness on the real side for now.  In September I noted that my biggest concern was the possibility that the inflation trend would worsen.  It does not appear that this is happening at this point.  However, we have yet to see lower rates of core inflation, and I’m sensitive to the fact that core measures of inflation are being held up by the contribution to owners’ equivalent rent from the rising rents and falling utility bills.  Although more-stable energy prices will make the latter effect go away, it’s not clear that the rent part of the picture will quickly fade, as rents continue to converge toward still high housing prices.  When we look at the distribution of prices in the CPI, excluding energy, food, and owners’ equivalent rent, prices seem to be either rising rapidly or falling. There isn’t much in the middle, and that makes the underlying movements in the inflation trend hard to interpret. It seems to me that the key risk on the real side of the economy has been that the housing market would decline much faster and more deeply than we had forecast and that the effect on consumption spending would be greater than we anticipated.  So far, as others have commented, the collateral effect on consumption appears to have been contained.  Furthermore, we expected that other forms of spending would hold up as the housing sector slumped, and those expectations appear to be on track for now.  I recognize that we’re not out of the woods yet, but the downside risks to the real economy appear somewhat more benign than they did at both the August and the September meetings.  In regard to the inflation risks, the probability of accelerating inflation has decreased, in my opinion, but the risk that inflation will remain higher than I personally desire hasn’t really changed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"270";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Five weeks have passed since our last FOMC meeting, and not surprisingly the outlook does not appear to have changed in any fundamental way.  Recent data bearing on the near-term situation point to noticeably slower growth in the third quarter than we anticipated at our last meeting.  However, the Greenbook has revised up its projection for growth during the current and next few quarters so that the overall effect on slack next year is roughly neutral.  This forecast strikes me as plausible, but there are few data thus far to bear it out.  Meanwhile, measures of consumer price inflation remain uncomfortably high, although the latest readings have been very slightly better. With regard to the pace of economic activity, there’s uncertainty in all directions.  In fact, we seem to have a bimodal economy with a couple of weak sectors, and the rest of the economy doing just fine.  Those two weak sectors are, of course, housing and domestic auto production. Autos seem likely to have only a short-lived effect.  In the case of housing, we agree with the Greenbook assessment of housing activity and find it quite consistent with the reports of our contacts in this sector.  Besides the falloff in activity, house-price increases have also slowed markedly.  The Case-Shiller house-price index has been flat in recent months, and futures on this index show outright declines next year.  However, equity valuations for homebuilders, as Cathy mentioned, have risen moderately in the past couple of months, following large declines over the previous year, and we interpret that as providing some indication that the expected future path of home prices has at least stopped deteriorating.  Of course, housing is a relatively small sector of the economy, and its decline should be self-correcting.  So the bigger danger is that weakness in house prices could spread to overall consumption through wealth effects.  This development would deepen and extend economic weakness, potentially touching off a nonlinear type of downward dynamic that could trigger a recession.  But so far at least, there are no signs of such spillovers.  Consumption spending seems on track for healthy growth. Nonetheless, the growth estimate for the third quarter begins with a 1 and just barely. Any time a forecast is that low, it’s reasonable to consider the possibility that the economy could enter recession.  So for this reason, we, like the Board’s staff, took a careful look at various approaches to assess this issue, including yield-curve-based models, past forecast errors, leading indicator models, and surveys.  Our bottom line is that we agree with the basic results reported in Monday’s nonfinancial briefing.  The highest probability of recession that we found, around 40 percent, was obtained from a model developed by a Board staff member.  The model includes the slope of the yield curve and the level of the funds rate.  An issue with this result is that long-term rates may currently be low, hence the yield curve inverted, for unusual and not very well understood reasons having to do with the risk premium.  Estimates from the other approaches came in with lower probabilities.  Finally, other financial developments that could presage future economic performance, like stock market movements and risk spreads, suggest some optimism on the part of financial market participants. So our sense is that, except for housing and autos, the economy appears to be doing quite well.  Indeed, the recent rather sharp drop in energy prices could boost consumption spending even more than assumed in the Greenbook.  While this is a possibility, it seems more likely to me that households ran down their savings to fill their gas tanks when gas prices rose and are, therefore, likely to use their recent savings at the pump to bolster their finances, at least partly. Overall, under the assumption of an unchanged funds rate, our forecast shows a beautiful soft landing, with real GDP growing at a moderately below-trend pace for a few more quarters and homing in near trend thereafter.  But I must admit that we got this forecast essentially by averaging the strong and weak sides of the economy.  I think that way of proceeding is reasonable, and I hope the landing happens that way.  But I acknowledge there is plenty of risk. We may end up instead with either the strong or the weak side dominating the outcome.  For example, if the housing market decline does not spread significantly to consumption, we could end up with a strong economy in fairly short order.  However, if it does spread, the slowdown could last quite a while.  Scenarios like this are nicely spelled out in the alternative simulations in the Greenbook. Which way things go is a key issue, given that we’re in the vicinity of full employment. The desired soft landing depends on growth remaining below trend long enough to offset the moderate amount of excess demand that appears to be in the economy so that inflation can trend gradually lower.  The slight drop in unemployment, to 4.6 percent, in September did not help in that regard, and I should note that recent comments by our head office directors almost uniformly supported the idea that labor markets, especially for skilled workers, are tight.  However, we do expect the unemployment rate to edge higher over the next year in response to sluggish growth. Our forecast for core consumer inflation comes down a bit faster than foreseen by the Greenbook.  We have core PCE price inflation edging down from just under 2½ percent this year to just over 2 percent in 2007 and see a good chance that it may fall a bit below 2 percent in the following year.  We see the relief on energy prices as helpful, although we keep trying to resist any temptation to overestimate the extent to which past energy price pass-through has been boosting core inflation.  Inflation also may benefit from an unwinding of the earlier strong pressures on rents.  Finally, as in the discussion we had earlier about the alternative Greenbook scenario, we think inflation may have become less persistent over the past decade, and this is one reason that we’re a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook about the possible degree of disinflation over the next couple of years.  But on balance, I have to admit we don’t have a perfect understanding of why inflation has been so high over the past few years, and so I try to remain humble, as always, in my predictions. My bottom line is this.  I see a non-negligible chance that the downside risks to the economy, emanating especially from housing, could produce a recession in coming quarters, but there’s a very good chance that the spillovers will be sufficiently modest that the economy will avoid a recession.  I also see a significant chance that growth could modestly exceed potential. In that sense, the overall risks to the outlook for real GDP growth could be characterized as balanced.  In addition, I see quite a bit of uncertainty about inflation going forward with the risks to my forecast probably being a bit to the high side."
"271";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20061025meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our view of the national outlook hasn’t changed much since September.  If monetary policy follows the path that’s laid out in the Greenbook, and it’s flat for the next few quarters, then we expect growth to return to a level close to 3 percent in ’07 and for inflation to moderate gradually from current levels. However, we still face the basic tension in the forecast—the combination of relatively high core inflation today and an economy that has slowed significantly below trend—and we still face the same basic questions:  Will inflation moderate enough and soon enough to keep inflation expectations reasonably stable at reasonably low levels?  Will weakness spread beyond housing and cumulate?  Relative to September, we see somewhat less downside risk to growth and somewhat less upside risk to inflation, but as in September, I think inflation risks should remain our predominant concern. Relative to the Greenbook, we expect somewhat faster growth in ’07, but we have a higher estimate of potential.  The difference is really mostly about hours and trend labor force growth.  We expect more moderation in core PCE and expect it to fall just below 2 percent in ’07, but this difference is mostly the result of different assumptions about persistence.  With these exceptions, our basic story about the contour of the expansion is fairly close to the Greenbook, and the implications for monetary policy are similar. The markets do seem relatively positive, a little more optimistic about the near-term outlook.  Equity prices, credit spreads, and market interest rates all reflect somewhat less concern about both recession and inflation risks.  Some of this, however, is probably the result of the exceptional factors supporting what the markets call liquidity.  What is liquidity, and what’s behind it?  I don’t know that we have a good answer to that.  Most people would cite a combination of the facts that real interest rates are fairly low in much of the world still, that reserve accumulation by the countries that shadow the dollar is still quite large, that a big energy-price windfall is producing demand for financial assets, particularly in dollars, and that there is confidence in the willingness and ability of the central bank, particularly this central bank, to save the world from any significant risk of a recession.  I don’t think all of this, therefore, is the result simply of confidence about fundamentals, so we shouldn’t take too much reassurance.  But it still is a somewhat more positive constellation of asset prices, of market views about the outlook. Someone wrote this week that the fog over the outlook has lifted.  I don’t think that’s quite right.  It’s true that the economy still looks pretty good except for housing, and I do think it’s fair to say that core inflation is moderating and that expectations are behaving in ways that should be pretty reassuring to us.  But it is too soon to be confident that inflation is going to moderate sufficiently soon enough with the path of monetary policy priced into markets today, and it is too soon to be confident also that the weakness we see in housing, in particular, won’t spread and won’t cumulate.  So I think that overall the balance of risks hasn’t changed dramatically, and as in September, I still view the inflation risk as the predominant concern of the Committee."
"272";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Are there other questions?  If not, we’re ready for our economic go-round.  As always, two-handed interventions are available.  President Yellen.,   President Yellen, did I understand you to say that the GDI being higher than the GDP increases both actual output and potential output and so should be read as mostly a neutral distinction?,   Thank you.  President Moskow.,   Thank you.  President Fisher.,   On that note, President Minehan.  [Laughter],   Thank you.  President Lacker.,   Thank you.  President Pianalto.,   Thank you.  President Poole.,   Thank you.,   President Lacker.,   President Plosser.,   Thank you.  President Hoenig.,   Thank you.  First Vice President Barron.,   Thank you.  President Stern.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Thank you.  Governor Bies.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Governor Warsh, I’m going to put you on the spot.  You and many others have talked about the liquidity in the market, and I want to understand better what that means.  First, liquidity can refer to the availability of buyers and sellers; clearly, that has increased over the past years as we’ve had hedge funds and other actors increasing their activity.  That simply makes markets more efficient and lowers the costs of trading.  I don’t think that’s a bad thing, if that’s what we’re talking about.  The second possibility refers to monetary aggregates, and we know that hasn’t been a serious concern.  Money growth has generally been pretty slow.  A third possibility, which is the one that I subscribe to, is that the big demand for assets reflects the global saving glut, which means that there’s an awful lot of money out there looking for returns that is coming from abroad and from high rates of saving relative to investment in other parts of the world.  But if the saving glut is, in fact, a source of liquidity, then actually, as President Lacker I believe mentioned, the equilibrium rate should be lower, not higher, to be consistent with the real rate that clears the saving and investment market.  So I was just wondering, what is your view about the meaning of this liquidity issue?,   Thank you.  With apologies to Governors Kroszner and Mishkin, I think it’s time to take coffee break.  [Laughter]  Let’s take a fifteen-minute break, and then we’ll come back. [Coffee break],   Let’s reassemble.  Governor Kroszner, if you’re ready.,   Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you.  Let me just summarize and add a few comments.  As Governor Kroszner mentioned, we had an avalanche of data, and the snowman is still standing in the same place as before.  [Laughter] Most people still see a two-track or bimodal economy.  In the first part of the economy— the goods economy, housing and manufacturing—there seems to be some softening since the last meeting but not a large change.  Housing remains the center of the weakness.  There are some indications that demand for housing may be stabilizing, but a few people noted that there are probably still some downside risks in that sector.  Manufacturing is also becoming a bit softer, partly but not entirely linked to housing.  Automobiles, too, have softened, and a few other areas as well, as I’ll discuss later.  One interesting point was that, where the aggregate data show some decline in growth in commercial real estate and the Greenbook seconds that conclusion, the anecdotes do not seem all that consistent with it.  The second part of the economy, which is focused primarily on services, remains quite strong, particularly in sustaining a robust labor market with good income growth.  Together with lower energy prices, those factors are leading to well-sustained consumption, which is continuing to drive the economy forward.  A few people mentioned balance sheet issues for the consumer, but the references to balance sheets were both negative and positive. Looking forward, again to compliment the staff, I think most people around the table accepted the general contour of the Greenbook forecast—that is, moderate growth perhaps below potential for the next few quarters but returning to potential growth later next year, with risks to the upside as well as to the downside.  So far there is little evidence of spillover into consumption in particular, although obviously we have to keep an eye on that.  There are a number of strong underlying conditions, including supportive financial conditions, strong profits, and a strong international economy, which are providing a cushion to the economy. On inflation, I have to say there wasn’t much change in view.  Most of you still expect a gradual decline in inflation.  Others are concerned that we might get stuck at current levels. Even those who expect a gradual decline remain somewhat concerned about the pace of the decline.  Some of the factors that may return inflation to lower levels are a slowing economy, well-contained inflation expectations, and the downward revisions to the wage data.  Those who are more concerned about inflation cited the weakening dollar, accommodative financial conditions, and the expectation that growth will not be below potential for very long.  So I think that some of these concerns and risk assessments do not seem markedly different from those at our last meeting. Let me add just a few comments.  These are all marginal because I think the broad outlines of the story and the risks are quite reasonable.  First, I think I took a bit more weakness from the data in the first part of the economy than some people around the table.  The Greenbook has single-family housing starts leveling out at current levels.  They did fall 16 percent in October.  We’re not entirely sure that they will, in fact, stabilize.  Multifamily construction permits have been dropping:  They’re off about 30 percent since the first quarter.  That had been a source of stability so far this year.  There might be a bit less strength there.  Then, nonresidential construction is an issue.  The data, in terms of employment and construction put in place, suggest some slowing, and I do think that some slowing from the very strong pace of earlier this year is pretty much inevitable.  But the sense of the Committee must be that we will have to wait a bit longer to judge how much that is going to slow.  In manufacturing, obviously the strongest slowdowns are related to autos and housing.  But if you look at employment and the ISM data, for example, you also see weakness in areas like machinery and electrical machinery, which suggests some possible weakness in equipment and software spending going forward. This remark does not represent a major difference with the Committee; I just saw a bit more weakness in the first area than some did. At the same time, like many members of the Committee, I see a very strong labor market and a very strong services sector plus a very strong nonmanufacturing ISM, which, though it includes construction, was nevertheless still very strong.  One begins to wonder a bit about the measurement of the services sector—whether or not we are understating growth and productivity in that sector.  That’s a question we’ll need to continue to consider.  So like most people around the table, I think that a soft landing with growth a bit below potential in the short run looks like the most likely scenario.  I expect the unemployment rate to increase gradually but income growth and other factors to be sufficient to keep consumption above 2 percent, which is essentially what we need to keep the economy growing.  Again, I see the risks going in both directions. Let me add a couple of extra comments about risks in the housing market.  I talked last time about the dynamics of starts.  Even if final demand stabilizes, starts may take a time to fully work out the inventories.  A couple of other factors are like that, which I just would like to bring to your attention.  One has to do with the very strong presumption we seem to have now that demand for housing has stabilized.  That may be the case, but I would point out that we have seen a very sharp decline in mortgage rates.   People may have a sort of mean-reverting model of mortgage rates in their minds.  It could be they are looking at this as an opportunity to jump in and buy while the financial conditions are favorable.  So even if rates stay low, we face some risk of a decline in demand.  The counter argument to that, which I should bring up, is that if people thought that prices were going to fall much more, then they would be very reluctant to buy.  That’s evidence for stabilization of demand.  Another point to make about housing is that, even when starts stabilize, there are going to be ongoing effects on GDP and employment.  On the GDP side, it takes about six months on average to complete residential structures.  Therefore, even when starts stabilize, we’re going to continue to see declines in the contribution of residential construction to GDP. On the employment side, I asked Bruce Fallick of the staff to run a regression of residential construction employment on residential single-family starts and to project forward what the employment results are going to be.  According to this regression, if starts stabilize at the October level, as projected by the Greenbook, the job losses in that sector will actually continue to rise for the next two or three months and return to the November level of about 15,000 per month only by the middle of next year.  There will be lagged employment effects from the housing sector and presumably from the associated manufacturing sectors, like appliances and furniture, which also tend to lag.  So there will be some employment drag coming forward, and I think it’s reasonable to think that unemployment rates will start to rise.  But, again, this is about 15 percent of the economy as compared with 85 percent of the economy. On inflation, I agree that the latest core PCE number was disappointing.  I think perhaps it overstates the trend a bit, just as the core CPI number understates the trend a bit.  I think there are still indications of a mild deceleration in prices, and most of the factors supporting that are coming into place, including the slowing of rents, the improved energy situation, some increase in slack, and expectations, which include a five-by-five-year expectation which has come down about 20 basis points since we stopped raising rates in August.  So I think there are some bases to expect a gradual decline in inflation.  I would note also that outside forecasters are a bit more optimistic about this than the Greenbook is.  For example, the Blue Chip median forecast of core PCE inflation for next year is 0.2 percentage point lower than the Greenbook on a comparable basis. I’ve talked before about owners’ equivalent rent, which is a somewhat special category, and I’ve indicated that I think its slowing will contribute to slower inflation.  In the interest of being even-handed, let me talk about a category that might go in the other direction, which is medical costs.  Medical costs in the short run depend a great deal on government policy, Medicare reimbursement decisions, and the like.  Therefore, only in the medium term will they respond to monetary policy.  I think that’s a source of risk.  The twelve-month change in medical costs has been declining:  It was 4.3 percent in 2003, 3.5 percent in 2004, 3.3 percent in 2005, and 2.9 percent so far this year.  So that gradual decline in medical costs has been a positive in terms of inflation.  But in the latest month, the number was 0.6 percent on a one-month basis, or more than 7 percent on an annualized basis.  To the extent that we see some bounceback of medical costs, that’s going to be another factor of concern in terms of inflation going forward. Again, however, I think that we have some reason to think that inflation will slow, but I don’t disagree with the very wide sentiment I hear around the table that the slowing is far from certain and that the risks are still to the upside on inflation. Are there any comments on or questions about my summary?  If not, let’s go to Brian, who will introduce the policy discussion."
"273";"MR. BARRON.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the intermeeting period, the Sixth District’s economic activity largely reflected the trends in the nation as a whole.  But the magnitude has been amplified by the region’s relatively large exposure to housing-related activities.  Specifically, while Florida continues to bear the brunt of the housing correction, we have increasingly heard reports of sales declines in other areas, too.  For instance, an announcement at a recent conference of Atlanta homebuilders was that “Atlanta’s ability to outrun the downturn has run out.”  The recent survey of the Beige Book would confirm this, in that contacts indicated that 67 percent of the District builders consider their inventory of unsold new homes to be either high or extremely high. The decline in housing market activity is affecting housing-related sectors such as construction, real estate services, wood products and manufacturing, and carpet production, to which our District is more exposed than are other parts of the country.  For instance, Florida has a concentration of residential construction that is about 50 percent greater than that of the United States as a whole, and Florida’s construction employment has been declining at an annualized pace of 10 percent each month since May.  Georgia is home to the largest concentration of carpet production in the United States, and these firms have reported that they are scaling back production as well as employment.  We expect the negative effect on construction-related sectors to intensify over the next few months as builders complete current projects and significantly curtail future projects.  Lending related to real estate has been a significant source of revenue and growth for District banks in recent years.  Our banking contacts report that the pipeline of real estate lending has all but dried up.  Some also noted concern about the prospective financial strength of smaller builders, although most expect the larger builders to be able to weather the downturn.  On the consumer side, asset quality remained good, but some banks noted concern about the potential negative effects from adjustable rate mortgage resets that will occur in 2007. The good news for the housing outlook is that the continued decline in starts and the leveling-off of sales may have arrested the run-up in the inventories of unsold new housing.  It’s hard to tell if we’re getting close to the bottom of the housing slump.  Several of our builder contacts in Florida say that they expect sales to improve in the second quarter of 2007.  Also, most contacts expect a pickup in the multifamily rental market in 2007. Outside the housing sector, indicators of economic performance in the District were mixed.  Nonresidential construction remains at modest levels, with the pace for October and November being about what it was in 2005.  Builders expect that the overall pace for 2007 will match that of 2006, and signs are that the demand for office and industrial space is picking up, with lower vacancies and rents beginning to firm.  Early reports on holiday retail sales were on the positive side.  However, tourism performance in Florida has disappointed in recent months. Visitors to all areas of Florida are down so far in 2006, which could give the state the first year- over-year drop since the September 11 terrorist attacks.  The shuttering of the Ford auto assembly plant in Atlanta and the weak performance by GM, Saturn, and Nissan have led us to cut District auto production.  However, on net, the strong performance by Mercedes, Honda, and Hyundai has been more than enough to keep overall auto production in the District moving along at a relatively solid clip. Along the Gulf Coast, much uncertainty remains about the long-term economic recovery of New Orleans.  One hope for a signal of recovery was the restarting of the Crescent City’s tourism and convention business.  Unfortunately, indicators such as airport traffic and convention bookings have not strengthened over the year and remain well below pre-storm levels.  In contrast, a key Mississippi Coast economic engine is up and running—the casinos. [Laughter]  All the casinos damaged or destroyed by Katrina have reopened, and gaming revenues have returned to pre-storm levels, in some cases even above those levels.  This signal has generated optimism about the eventual recovery of the Mississippi Coast. Putting aside the problems of accurately calibrating growth in real GDP for the national economy that were discussed in the Greenbook, it seems clear that the slowing of the economy that many of us noted last meeting continues.  At the same time, some of the pressures on the inflation side may be abating as well.  Housing and its potential spillover effects to other segments of the economy remain a question mark, as does the slowing in manufacturing that now appears to be in progress.  However, several factors suggest that the slowdown is transitory and that the risk is relatively small that it will turn into a full-fledged recession.  For example, corporate profits remain healthy.  Business investment has continued to expand, although a bit more slowly.  The most recent labor report is quite positive, with job growth now averaging about 138,000 over the past three months.  Going forward, the decline of the dollar suggests that net exports will be less of a drag on our output.  This conclusion about the likely path of the economy is also consistent with our own District model forecasts that have changed only slightly from October.  They have shifted in almost the same way that the Greenbook forecast has, and the differences are relatively small when all things are considered.   Let me stop and save my other comments for the policy go-round."
"274";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, at the last meeting I provided anecdotal evidence, as I always do after my survey of CEOs and CFOs, of a slowdown for some sectors.  I spoke of housing, which I’ve been a bit more concerned about to date than even our models have indicated.  I referred to slowing trucking activity for the Christmas season, and I reported that the book-to-bill ratio for semiconductors, although that is highly volatile, slipped below 1 for the first time in quite some time.  I also cited the aggressive consumer-product advertising as we approach year-end, which is occurring rather early.  I concluded that, in netting those reports against the activity of the rails, the shipping companies, and other service-sector activity, growth in the third quarter seemed to have proceeded at a pace slightly north of 2 percent, or at least at a run rate about in that region.  Then inflation measured by the trimmed mean, which as you know is how we like to look at things at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, though dipping in September was still hovering in the high 2s as measured over the three-month and twelve-month intervals.  I expressed that, going forward, the balance seemed to be skewed more toward the inflation side than toward substandard growth. I would agree with President Yellen and President Moskow, if I heard them correctly, that basically the tails have gotten a little fatter—that is, we’re concerned that there might be slightly less growth, but at the same time we still have concerns about inflation.  So I’d like to address the two very briefly.  On the inflation front, in October the trimmed mean bounced back to 2.6 percent from the 1.6 percent that we had in September, driven upward, as David mentioned, by accelerating medical care prices and a pickup in owners’ equivalent rent, although that was somewhat slight. The median PCE inflation rate was 4 percent.  Of concern to me is that, although the percentage of goods with rising prices fell, the percentage with more-rapid increases rose and components with a rise of over 5 percent have gone from 16 percent to 30 percent of the components measured overall in October. With regard to economic activity, I think there are some continued negatives and some positives.  I’d like to pick up on the negatives that I mentioned at the last meeting.  The airlines that I discussed are reporting even more aggressive discounting.  One of my contacts, who I think is the longest serving and most successful CEO in the airline industry, said this is the most aggressive discounting that he remembers.  Of course, we’ve all seen Wal-Mart’s numbers.  There is difficulty in sorting through what is of their own making in terms of their branding and what is the overall slowdown in activity.  But the truckers to whom I have been talking are still not noticing the pickup in the Christmas activity that they expected, Mr. Chairman.  Other retailers, too, are reporting some softness.  There is some discussion of whether or not it makes a difference that we have one extra day in the retailing season for Christmas this year.  The Thanksgiving surge that they expected in sales clearly did not occur in almost every category of income except for the very highest.  The semiconductor producers are reporting a “grim” outlook in terms of their book-to-bill ratios and what they’re selling forward.  I have just one other comment on energy.  Perhaps the largest operator for the OPEC countries points out that they have realized 60 percent of their announced cuts—that’s a typical ratio.  Al-Naimi, who is the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Saudi Arabia, is pressing for another million barrel cut, presumably to bring the total cut up to the 1.2 million barrels that were being targeted.  So the negatives seem to still be in place. As far as the positives are concerned, at least at the margin, I’d like to report on a few of them.  One is that convenience store operators are reporting a little turn-up in volume and finally seeing the effect of lower gas prices at the pump, and retailers in the past week have noticed a slight pickup from what they were reporting at the end of the November holiday season.  With regard to housing, as you know, I speak to two of the five largest builders, and I’ve added a third to that sample.  David, they are reporting what they call a sense of a turn, but this may be their perpetual optimism.  But cancellation rates have improved from 40 percent to 32 percent according to the reports, and actually in November there was a gross pickup in unit sales of about 3 percent according to these reports.  So they are feeling that some pent-up demand is building.  The interesting thing about that industry in particular is that they are all walking away from their options. One of the largest said that they expect to end up with only 20 percent of their land options, and yet land prices have not yet fallen.  So I think that’s the next shoe that will likely drop. Other than housing, in surveying the twenty-six CEOs and three CFOs to whom I speak, I hear no report of consumer or client payment problems or lagging payments, which is often an indicator, on a serial basis, that there is weakness ensuing.  Again, going back to one of my favorite indicators, which is a large express shipper, my contact said, “I don’t feel any real changes from what we saw in the last four to five months.”  That large express shipper is looking at GDP growth of about 2 percent or slightly north of 2 percent.  Also, I like to look at restaurants because they employ perhaps up to 14 million people, so it’s not an unimportant sector.  For the twenty-five companies in the casual dining sector, sales have declined.  At the same time, their guest count has gone down even further, which indicates what we expected before—if you’ll forgive the pun—a move down the food chain from restaurants like Chili’s to McDonald’s and so on.  This is what you would expect in terms of continued tightness, and yet they are beginning to sense a slight turn because gas prices at the pump may be kicking in. Finally, I want to touch on some negatives disguised as positives.  The first is the ready availability of capital.  I think Dino was very good in his presentation this morning, as he always is. One CEO of a company in the service sector, largely in the entertainment business, does not see much slowing taking place.  He said that the availability of capital is like “dog droppings in Central Park”—no matter where you step, capital is readily available.  To an old pension fund manager like me that indicates a potential trip wire, which is what Dino said.  So I think risk is certainly there. Another negative disguised as a positive would be the robust activity we’re still seeing in the energy sector, although I would summarize it by saying that the foot has been taken off the accelerator.  We haven’t stopped.  There’s a bit less rig count in the mix, and yet there’s still a great deal of construction activity, as we find that the petrochemicals are improving their refining capacity and meeting modern standards, and there are huge numbers of coal gasification projects, not just in Texas utilities but also elsewhere in the country. Mr. Chairman, the labor shortage in the Gulf—the Golden Coast, as we call it—is significant.  One oil company alone estimates that, for petrochemical purposes, they are at least 20,000 workers short.  The mayor of Texas City, which has the highest concentration of petrochemical plants in the country in his district, called a meeting of all the labor unions last month.  The mayor, who sits on our board, said that the unions report that they cannot find workers. If TXU proceeds with the coal gasification plants, they’re looking at 5 million manhours per project, and they have ten projects on the board, assuming that they’re approved.  The point is that we do still see a significant shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor.  So as you depart for China, Mr. Chairman, having spoken about the two fat tails, I would urge you to be careful of any Fu dogs with two tails.  [Laughter]"
"275";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, the Tenth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Activity has slowed somewhat, but our region is still probably doing a little better than the nation as a whole.  One area in which we may be doing a bit better is housing, even though we have slowed just as everyone else has.  Our surveys show that the inventories of unsold homes, although elevated, are less than they are in other regions of the country and that they have not accelerated much since last summer.  Our real estate contacts have indicated to us that they think inventories will be coming down over the next few months because the slowing in construction is bringing them back into line.  It will take some time, however. On the manufacturing side also, we have a bit more positive information in the region than perhaps nationwide.  While we have had a slowdown in areas related to housing and autos, the areas related to oil and gas, railroads, commercial offices, and high-tech equipment in the District are generally noting strong and even increasing demand, and we’re expecting those businesses to expand their operations accordingly.  Some of our machinists and machine manufacturing organizations have actually seen some fairly strong growth, and their six-month outlook is also strong, especially in the export sector.  Energy activity has remained strong in the District, despite some declines in our mountain region, where costs of drilling are higher, and that has caused some reduction in rig count.  Other areas in the Oklahoma panhandle and so forth are really going quite strong. Consumer spending remains solid, and early holiday returns have generally been quite positive.  Mall managers in the District’s cities reported solid traffic after Thanksgiving, and we’re off to a very good start for the December holidays.  Labor markets also remain fairly good in the region, and as others have reported, our demand for skilled labor is really quite good, and finding individuals to fill positions is difficult right now.  However, a couple of pieces of anecdotal information offset that a bit.  In the past couple of months, the temporary hiring area has had a slowdown in their sales growth, which surprised the chairman of our board of directors to some degree—I don’t know whether he mentioned this last week when he was here.  Also, a couple of major trucking firms, while not saying that business is bad or anything like that, are saying that business is noticeably slower than it has been in other such holiday periods.  Whether or not it’s packaging they’re not willing to say, but they are saying that it sure is slower. On the national outlook, I don’t have any real disagreements with the Greenbook in that we see growth to be below potential.  What potential is may be a question.  However, we do see growth below potential but returning gradually over 2007 into 2008.  Obvious risks to that forecast are, on the downside, housing and, on the upside, perhaps some strength in foreign demand.  We have seen the latter, as I mentioned, in our manufacturing sector, and I think it may bring some strength to the economy as we look ahead. On the inflation front, our outlook is for inflation to come down gradually—we continue to think that monetary policy is slightly restrictive—and, with that, inflation numbers.  For example, core CPI inflation would come down from 2.8 percent to 2.5 percent in ’07 and perhaps to 2.3 percent in ’08; the core PCE would average around 2 percent over 2007 and 2008, falling from 2.1 to 1.9.  Those are obviously rough estimates, but they are showing the trend.  The risks, of course, are in what happens to energy.  On the other side, frankly, is what happens to the dollar because, if that continues to go down, it would create some upside inflationary pressures that we’d have to think about and deal with as we go forward.  So with that, I will stop and wait for the policy discussion for the rest of my comments.  Thank you."
"276";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of you have remarked, the incoming data on spending at least have been consistent with our basic outlook for economic activity. Weakness in housing and autos will hold activity to below the growth rate of potential for a few quarters but with limited spillover to other forms of household spending.  As inventory overhangs in these two sectors are dealt with, growth will return to something like the growth rate of potential.  From some perspectives, the recent data have actually suggested diminished downside risk to the story.  Stabilizing house sales, recovering mortgage applications, and improving consumer attitudes toward home purchases may be the signs of a housing market beginning to find a bottom.  The expected downward path of prices in the Case-Shiller index futures market has actually been revised higher over the intermeeting period; it is still sloping down but not as much.  Auto producers have held production steady in the fourth quarter and announced a small increase in production for the first quarter.  Moreover, consumption outside autos has remained on a healthy track. Now, the downside risks in these areas may be smaller, but they certainly haven’t been eliminated.  The Greenbook projection has starts stabilizing at the current level, but we have yet to see hard evidence of that stability.  The last data point was a substantial decline that was larger than we expected.  Inventory overhangs in the housing sector are large and will be worked down fairly slowly in the staff forecast.  Heads of households may be just coming to the realization that their kids’ tuition and their retirement will not be taken care of by further outsized increases in the value of their homes. A bit more troubling than the housing and consumption data—and perhaps indicative of other sources of downside risk—have been the rise in inventories and the softness in manufacturing production outside the auto and construction-related sectors.  Much of the downward revision to private final demand from the last Greenbook to this one, taking into account both the third and the fourth quarters, was in business fixed investment, and it occurred when profits remained robust and sales—excluding autos and residential housing—strong. Evidence of broader weakness in the manufacturing sector seemed to account for at least a portion of the reaction of the financial markets over the intermeeting period. There are a number of reasons to think that this weakness is limited.  The underlying economy remains in good shape.  Commodity prices have continued to climb, probably partly reflecting the weaker dollar but also indicative of underlying strength in global demand.  Firms are adding to payrolls in a way they wouldn’t if they were sensing the possibility of softness spreading outside manufacturing.  Equity prices and risk spreads suggest expectations of continued good growth, even if in the eyes of investors it might take some easing of policy to produce that outcome.  As President Stern noted, anecdotes—as reflected in the Beige Book and what we’ve heard from visitors, including the Reserve Bank chairs and vice chairs who were here very recently—suggest that businesses are experiencing and expect continued good business conditions.  These anecdotes very markedly contrast to the fall of 2000, when by November the tone of the feedback from businesses had turned decidedly gloomier. The Committee has been focused on housing and consumption, but the recent data and the financial market’s response may suggest the possibility that something else could be going on.  Perhaps the removal of policy accommodation has affected other forms of spending more than we had anticipated.  I think that the basic story of growth strengthening to potential over the next year remains valid and that it will be strong enough to withstand a rise in longer-term interest rates that would accompany a flat fed funds rate as in the Greenbook.  Moreover, the overall downside risks to that forecast probably haven’t increased very much, but they may have changed source or character.  We will need to be alert to possible sources of weakness that we hadn’t anticipated. With regard to the inflation outlook, I, like the staff, have characterized the incoming data as leaving expectations for a very gradual decline in inflation intact, if the economy follows something like the Greenbook path.  To be sure, core PCE inflation did not ease back, but the CPI did quite a bit.  Labor cost pressures appear to be less than we had previously estimated, and various measures of long-term inflation expectations remain within their ranges of the past several years. My presumption, like that of the staff, is that at some point lagging spending growth will be reflected in labor markets and will help to remove inflation pressures.  But for now, the risks around the expected downward trend in inflation remain skewed to the upside.  Unit labor costs are still accelerating, although not as much as we thought they were, and businesses won’t readily absorb higher costs and reduced profit margins.  The unemployment rate remains low. The index of capacity utilization in manufacturing continues to be above its long-term average, suggesting continued pressures in resource markets and, by extension, in markets for goods and services, which will contribute both to higher costs and to the ability of businesses to pass them on.  The forecast path to inflation is sufficiently gradual that upward deviations from it could entail outsized costs in terms of embedding another notch up in underlying inflation and inflation expectations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"277";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Last time several of us noted that there would be an avalanche of data between the last meeting and this one [laughter]—two employment reports, two rounds of ISM, GDP, ECI, compensation revisions, all of that.  But it seems from the discussion here that we’ve actually gotten very little new information, with one exception, and that relates to Dave Stockton.  We heard that not long ago he was on the psychiatrist’s couch dealing with a schizophrenia issue of whether the economy is going up or going down.  But now we know that he is on his death bed.  [Laughter]  I hope this does not bode ill for the economy going forward, but I did want to note that one very important change, Mr. Chairman. We’ve had the same discussion of a two-tiered economy, with housing and autos being slower and the rest of the economy moving forward, and continuing concerns about the risk of spillovers; but the central tendency seems to be that we’ll be moving ahead perhaps a little below potential, with some reasonable chance of getting back to something closer to potential by the end of next year.  Continuing the discussions of labor market tightness and some concerns about shortages in certain areas, I think that we certainly have seen some softness in construction, but that’s an area for which we’ve probably underestimated employment growth and perhaps employment falloff because, as I think many of us know, many of the subcontractors in residential as well as nonresidential housing have a lot of undocumented workers, and they tend to be undercounted both on the upside and on the downside.  So there may be a little more softness in the labor market than we’re seeing, at least in the construction sector; however, in the higher-skilled sectors, we’re seeing continued tightness. Consumer spending continues to be strong.  There has been just an amazing persistence of consumer spending, no matter what has happened over the past five years.  Whether the stock market has crashed, whether the housing market has boomed, whether we’ve had September 11, or whether we’ve had concerns about spillover effects, the consumer seems to have been very, very persistent, and it seems as though that’s the case now.  We’ve talked about challenges in the energy markets, and we did see a little slowing.  Energy prices were higher, and energy prices are lower, but these aspects of the macroeconomy seem still to have little effect on consumer spending. We continue to have concerns about some upside risks to inflation.  So I’ll just mention quickly a few issues and then talk about some international issues that Dino and Tim touched on earlier.  Regarding housing, we know we have terrible price data, but it seems as though there’s a little more flexibility and nimbleness in the housing market than there was in the past.  So the past data on housing may not be too useful.  Although we know we don’t get good data on effective prices, we do seem to be seeing more evidence that people, rather than just holding things on the market longer, are providing the marble bathroom, the Lexus, the Hyundai, the Kia, the Yugo, or whatever they’re providing.  In New Jersey, where I grew up, it would be a Yugo. [Laughter]  So I think there’s more flexibility on that side.  Also, because of the way the housing market has developed, a lot of residential construction is no longer at just the local level.  The large national builders are better diversified and, as has been discussed, have options on land, and then, if they see the market turning down, they give up those options.  So they have a much greater ability to shift both down and up in production much more quickly.  Prices, too, are a little more flexible, which is one reason that we’ve seen a sharper correction in the housing market.  But that flexibility, with the recent data indicating that certain things may be flattening out, may mean that, though the correction may have been sharper, it won’t necessarily persist— that the correction has occurred in a shorter time, rather than being dragged out longer and having more potential for negative spillover, confidence effects, and so forth. Well, what has changed?  As Governor Kohn mentioned, inventory accumulation is a bit of concern:  It seems to be ticking up.  It always seems a bit odd when a positive effect on GDP results from businesses being unable to sell the things that they’ve purchased.  That doesn’t strike me as necessarily a positive thing for a GDP report.  We’ve gotten some more, probably confusing, numbers on productivity.  Is productivity slowing or not?  We are getting some data that may be suggesting that it is, although I would agree with Dave and the staff that it’s much too early to say.  I think the evidence both anecdotally, as a number of people have mentioned, and more broadly is that productivity is likely to continue to go forward.  Another thing that changed, as Dino and others discussed, was the yield curve.  But this phenomenon is very much an international one.  Long rates have come down more—since the last meeting, they have fallen a fair amount and not just in the United States.  The three-month versus the ten-year in Europe has fallen about 40 basis points, so the spread is about 7 basis points now.  On average, since the euro has been around, it has been about 40 to 50 basis points.  In the United Kingdom, which tends on average to have very flat yield curves, the inversion has steepened about 25 basis points to 65 basis points.  Japan is little changed, but Japan is sui generis.  Emerging markets have also seen this.  In Mexico, for example, the ten-year versus the three-month has dropped about 60 basis points.  Clearly, this is not just a U.S. phenomenon, and I think it’s telling us not just about U.S. growth, unless you think that U.S. growth is driving world growth and so it’s really all about the United States.  I think that’s a bit extreme, even though, as was mentioned, some correlations suggest that when the United States goes down, there is a lagged effect and the rest of the world tends to go down.  But I think it’s suggesting that some other factor is occurring and that we shouldn’t read too much into it.  Also, interestingly, if you look at the real short and long rates around the world—at least for the industrial countries—real rates tend to be about 1½ to 2½ percent, which is very much where we are.  Thus there has been a convergence of real rates around the world.  So I would be wary of taking too much information from the bond market as referring to something that’s specific to the United States rather than to some factors that are common worldwide. Just quickly on inflation—we’ve talked about how energy prices have gone up and down but core inflation hasn’t been affected that much.  Labor market tightness doesn’t seem to have had much of an effect.  As for output gaps—if you like output gaps—when you look at the data, it’s hard to find much evidence of an effect of output gaps on core inflation.  Also, given the discussion that we’ve had, it doesn’t seem that the gap will be too wide or, even if you believe it will be wide, that you’d be getting much effect from it in the near term.  We talked about some temporary factors like owners’ equivalent rent that may have boosted measured inflation for a while and is now coming down.  I don’t think there will be much effect on inflation from the dollar.  The United States still is just not that open an economy.  Even to the extent that it is open, the pass-through of exchange rate changes to domestic prices is very slow and very partial—typically, over a three-year to five-year period, barely 50 percent.  The evidence suggests that the pass-through is decreasing.  Even if the dollar went down further, I don’t see much of an effect there.  That said, it’s hard to see exactly what forces are moving inflation in one way or another right now.  A reasonable scenario is that it could drift down slowly, but it’s hard to point to clear evidence of where it’s going to go.  To the extent that there is information in the yield curve, the markets clearly do not expect inflation to take off, and it’s likely that inflation will be moving lower or at least staying contained where it is.  So we have much data and relatively little information.  I see risks on both the upside and the downside to growth and have continuing concern about upside risks to inflation precisely because I don’t see an easy path to lower core inflation going forward.  I think that lower core inflation in the future is reasonable but uncertain, particularly given that it’s hard to see a lot of systematic evidence of factors that are occurring now that would be correlated with that result.  Thanks."
"278";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity continued to expand moderately in our District in November.  Manufacturing shipments and new orders bucked the national trend and rebounded last month following an October dip.  Revenues and hiring slowed a bit in the service sector but continued to expand moderately.  Retail was a bright spot:  Stores reported an uptick in sales and customer traffic for November, including the Thanksgiving weekend.  Our store contacts were generally optimistic about sales prospects for the coming holiday season.  Fifth District housing activity continues to soften on the whole, although there are areas that have seen much less, if any, of a slowdown.  We’re not hearing any reports of cutbacks in capital expenditures, and commercial real estate markets appear to remain fairly strong in our District. Reports on price pressures were mixed in November but remained at elevated levels. At the national level, an essential question seems to be how long the current weakness will persist.  To a large extent this question centers on the housing market, and it’s still hard to pin down the outlook with much certainty.  The special survey on homebuilders paints a picture that varies widely across the country.  Construction activity is falling at a rapid clip in many regions, but many housing markets are still fairly stable.  Nationally, there are some indicators suggesting that housing demand has stabilized at a low level.  Sales of new homes have been fluctuating around an annual rate of 1 million since July, and purchase mortgage applications have been fairly flat since then as well.  But the national data also show a sizable overhang of housing inventory that will continue to depress new building activity going forward.  If—and, like David, I recognize this is a big “if”—the demand for housing holds up at current levels—and favorable fundamentals such as moderate mortgage rates and continued real income gains should help—then the adjustment process is simply a matter of working inventories down.  This is consistent with the Greenbook’s estimate that residential investment will no longer subtract from real GDP growth after the first half of next year. The strength in nonresidential construction has until recently offset the decline in residential. Most recent reports show nonresidential construction spending and employment falling in recent months, although I’m struck by the fact that there are hardly any references in the Beige Book to deterioration in commercial construction and we aren’t hearing such reports from our contacts either.  So I’m not sure how much to mark down the nonresidential outlook just now. As David said, consumer spending keeps chugging along at about 3 percent despite weakening auto sales.  This is notable because one way the housing downturn could spread to the remainder of the economy is through a wealth effect.  So far I’m not persuaded by this gloomy view, and I think there are good reasons to doubt it.  Household net worth looks pretty strong, and equities continue to advance.  The other leading candidate for a spillover channel is the labor market, but so far the weakness in construction and real-estate-related employment has not been large enough to offset the broader strength in employment.  I remain skeptical of a housing-induced step-down in consumption growth.  Business investment continues to be a source of strength.  The Greenbook notes the possibility of negative accelerator effects, but the other fundamentals still look good.  Profitability is high, and cost of capital is low.  Moreover, financial markets are not showing signs of impending business weakness or investment slowdown.  In sum, it looks as though the current weakness is likely to be relatively transitory, and after the housing market correction plays out, we should return to near-trend growth.  There are risks to this outlook, to be sure, but this is what looks most likely to me right now. The recent news on inflation has been disappointing yet again.  It is now quite difficult to discern any moderating trend in core PCE inflation over the past several months.  You have to be really careful in selecting how many periods you average over, and I have serious doubts about the forces that are described as slowing inflation over the forecast period.  First, the recent fall in energy prices is now behind us by a couple of months, and prices are beginning to rise again.  If the Greenbook forecast is correct and in 2007 crude oil prices rise somewhat above their current level of $62 per barrel, then we have seen all we are going to see of the abatement of the effects of higher energy prices on core inflation, speaking to President Plosser’s point.  Second, since the odds seem to favor a further depreciation of the dollar, I think import prices are unlikely to help ease inflation much.  Third, as we’ve discussed at previous meetings, the projected increase in unemployment is not likely to have much of an effect on inflation, over the forecast period at least.  On top of all this, inflation expectations appear to be anchored between 2 and 2¼ percent right now, and they’re likely to exert a gravitational pull counteracting any moderation of inflation.  Thank you.,   Mr. Chairman.,   Bill, you talked about reconciling bond and equity markets based on a view that inflation pressures will ease and growth will be good.  When you say “inflation pressures will ease,” do you mean that inflation will come down or that we will not be motivated to raise real rates?"
"279";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I see the economy evolving very much along the lines of the past couple of Greenbooks, particularly the ones since I’ve been here.  The staff is to be very highly commended:  They pointed out that outcomes were going to be weaker than other forecasters thought, and they really did get it right.  Now, I have promised Dave that I wouldn’t jump on him when they get it wrong, and today I’ll be nice in the other direction.  I think their forecast has been very useful in terms of the numbers. In fact, I think we’re seeing the economy evolve very much along the lines that we discussed at the past couple of meetings.  There really is not all that much new.  I think there’s a smidgen more weakness on the real side, but it doesn’t alter my basic view that the economy is evolving along the lines of having slightly below potential GDP growth.  I don’t see any indications that we will have big spillovers into other sectors from weak housing and motor vehicles.  In that sense, there’s a slight concern about a little weakness, but the right word is I guess a “smidgen,” not a whole lot. I see that inflation pressures are also very similar to what they were at the time of our last meeting.  Inflation is likely to decelerate to somewhere around 2½ percent in the core CPI and 2 percent in the core PCE.  Part of the reason I believe those numbers is that the nature of the output paths we’ve talked about is consistent with them, but I also think that we have anchored inflation expectations around those levels.  I don’t like to use the word “persistence” the way other people do.  I think of mean reversion to expected inflation—and very likely that’s where inflation will be heading, given the paths that we see in terms of the economy and the forecast from the Greenbook.  I see the risks to forecast inflation as fairly balanced.  The good news is that compensation is not as scary as it was.  But the bad news is that the labor markets are very tight, and we’re just not quite sure what the implications of that are going to be.  So my view is that we have a bit greater uncertainty, not a whole lot, so that we need to be very vigilant on inflation because it is too high, labor markets are tight, and there is still some question about how quick the mean reversion to expected inflation will be.  We also need to be vigilant about real output.  There is a bit more certain information coming in, so I think we have to watch both inflation and output. The last thing to mention is the yield curve.  I did some of the research on yield curves in recessions, and I do not think that the yield curve is providing much information at this time, exactly for the reasons that Governor Kroszner and others have discussed.  I think there are special reasons that the term premium is extremely low.  There is always that nice little table of the yield curve and recession probabilities, but you notice that I haven’t mentioned it, and I’m not going to mention it in the future.  [Laughter]  Thank you very much."
"280";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Business activity in the Seventh District appears to be expanding at a slightly slower pace than the last time we met.  But most of my contacts were still positive about the outlook, and when we put together our forecast for the national economy, we did not make any large changes to the projections of either growth or inflation.  We see output recovering as we move into ’07 and core PCE staying near its current rate through the forecast period. As Janet discussed, we’ve talked about the bimodal nature of the national economy. Housing is weak, and the auto sector is struggling, but the rest of the economy is performing well. We see these sectoral differences, particularly with regard to autos, in our District economy. Michigan’s unemployment rate is about 7 percent, and it was the only state to show a year-over- year decline in the OFHEO house price measure.  In contrast, Illinois and Wisconsin have a more diversified manufacturing base, and they’re doing well.  Furthermore, we continue to hear reports of growth in demand for manufactured goods outside of autos and residential construction.  One example of this is Caterpillar.  They expect revenues from highway construction and mining equipment to remain strong with some easing in the U.S. market being offset by increased demand from abroad.  Manufacturers of machine tools continue to report solid orders.  Of course, such reports contrast sharply with our conversations with the Big Three automobile makers.  General Motors indicates that they expect ’07 to be another challenging year.  Incentives are one issue.  GM thinks that their own incentives are now about the right level, including the Classic, [laughter] whereas others are still high.  Another issue is that the UAW contract will be coming up for renewal next year in September, and the negotiations are expected to be difficult. Turning to labor markets more generally, Kelly and Manpower said that the overall nationwide placements of temporary workers were unchanged year over year, but placements of light industrial production workers continue to increase, and conversions from temporary to permanent remain strong.  Moreover, their clients, while cautious, generally do not expect any prolonged period of weakness.  These temp firms said that wage pressures were steady to down a bit, but a major national specialty retailer indicated that he was having difficulty hiring holiday workers and permanent workers and that he was planning for an increase of 10 to 12 percent in wages for entry-level full-time hires.  Retailers also told us that they believed strong labor markets were supporting spending, and they were looking forward to good results for the holiday season. With regard to inflation, even though energy prices have moved off their peaks, there were few signs of rollbacks in fuel surcharges.  Indeed, we even heard of further cost pass-throughs from petroleum-based inputs.  However, we did not get the sense that general cost pressures were intensifying. Finally, we held our annual economic outlook symposium ten days ago in the midst of the first major snowstorm of the year.  The three dozen hardy forecasters predicted real GDP growth of 2.8 percent in ’07 and the employment rate to drift up to 4.9 percent by the second half of the year. They also forecast that total CPI would increase 2½ percent and that sales of light vehicles would be 16.4 million units. Turning to the national outlook, the data have come in somewhat softer than I expected at our last meeting.  Our uncertainty about the outlook has increased somewhat, but I still think that there are significant forces supporting activity and that the economy will return to a better growth path as we move into next year.  To be sure, residential construction is quite weak, auto sales are softer, and the businesses supplying these industries are experiencing some sizable reductions in demand.  However, I do not get the sense of a secondary spillover to other sectors of the economy. Importantly, the labor market has remained robust, supporting household spending—as we’ve talked about.  Business confidence appears to be holding up fairly well.  Indeed, I’m impressed by the lack of pessimism among my contacts, even those who are experiencing flattening sales or sluggish sales.  Finally, real interest rates are low across the maturity spectrum, and risk spreads remain narrow.  Given the liquidity in the system, it’s still hard to see current financial conditions as being that restrictive. In the end, we did not make any large changes to the overall contours of our GDP forecast. We still see the economy growing moderately below potential in ’07 and increasing at a pace moderately above potential in 2008.  Now, we condition our baseline forecast on market expectations for interest rates.  Accordingly, this outlook is boosted by the expected decline in the funds rate that’s in the market.  If, like the Greenbook, we had assumed a flat federal funds rate path, we would project a recovery only to potential in ’08. Turning to inflation, the recent data have not clarified the trends.  The six-month change in the core PCE price index is down, but the three-month numbers have moved up.  In Chicago, we like to use indicator models, like the ones that Stock and Watson developed, as a way to assess the implications of incoming data for future inflation.  These are time series models, and they forecast inflation based on more than 80 economic indicators linked to inflationary pressures.  The projections of these models have changed little since our last meeting.  Our forecasts continue to show inflation running too high for my taste.  Even our most optimistic models, which are estimated using data only since 1984, have core PCE inflation flat at 2.4 percent through 2008.  In sum, I am still concerned that inflation will be too high for too long; and even though the downside risks to growth have increased, I continue to see inflation as the predominant risk."
"281";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic picture in our region has changed little since our last meeting.  The coincident indicators in our Business Outlook Survey suggested that economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace in each of our three states, and the business contacts expect that pace to continue.  I’m beginning to feel as though I’m reading the same chapter of the book again.  It’s like Yogi Berra—it’s déjà vu all over again. The weakest sector in our region, as in the nation, is of course housing, which continues to decline.  Sales and permits continue on a downward trend, and cancellations rose significantly in November; but builders have been able to resell, albeit at lower prices, homes whose initial purchasers have reneged.  However, our survey of smaller homebuilders suggests that conditions on average in the housing market in our District seem somewhat better than in the nation as a whole. None of the builders we polled reported low inventories of unsold homes.  Interestingly enough, 86 percent of them said their inventories were about right; only 14 percent said inventories were high; and no one reported that they were extremely high.  In comparison, across the nation, 51 percent of builders reported that inventories were either low or about right, and 49 percent reported either high or extremely high inventories.  Certainly some areas in our District have had a sharp drop in housing activity.  The most notable is the Jersey Shore.  But generally, based on what I’m hearing from firms in our District, I would continue to characterize the decline in housing in our region as an orderly one. Commercial real estate continues to perform very well.  We’ve had some downturn in the value of nonresidential building contracts in the last month, but these data are very volatile, and the revisions tend to be upward as new contracts are reported over time.  Our contacts in that sector continue to be among the most optimistic in our region.  Office vacancy rates continued to decline in the past few months both in Center City Philadelphia and in the suburbs, and the net absorption of office space continues to be positive.  Rents have risen, and the increase in occupancy has led to a scarcity of large blocks of available space, which bodes well for construction. Manufacturing activity in our region has been softening this fall, and we haven’t seen much of an increase since then.  After two negative readings in September and October, the general index of economic activity in our business outlook survey turned positive in November, but its level of slightly above 5 suggests that that’s really not much change in the outlook.  New orders and shipments were modestly weak.  Shipments were actually strong.  Orders were a little weaker, but the recent weakness is consistent with softness in national manufacturing and, as we’ve seen, in the purchasing managers’ index.  Optimism for future capital spending actually rebounded last month— so the picture there is very mixed.  Consumer spending continues to hold up well.  Auto dealers and retailers reported strong sales in November and are optimistic about the holiday season. Labor market conditions in the District have changed little.  Payroll employment growth in our three states is up at an annual rate of about 0.7 percent, which is slower than the national rate, but that’s just a fact of the population growth in our District.  Unemployment rates remain low, near or below the national rates.  Business contacts continue to cite difficulty in finding qualified workers, especially for skilled and professional positions.  Area employers indicate that, over the past few months, wages have been steadily rising at a pace higher than earlier this year. I also want to mention some anecdotal information that I find interesting.  Last week I met with a number of mostly manufacturing CEOs from my District.  An observation that one of them made, which many agreed with, was that from their perspective money was almost free.  This observation is consistent with what some others have been saying around the table.  They thought that there was plenty of liquidity and that interest rates were not limiting them particularly in any way.  This observation is also consistent with the views that mortgages rates are still relatively low and that credit spreads show less stress on businesses at this point.  I take these observations to indicate that monetary policy is not particularly restrictive at this point. Also on the anecdotal side, the several manufacturers who participate as suppliers to both homebuilding and commercial real estate lamented their housing-related business, whether plumbing, cabinetry, or flooring, which were the three industries represented.  On the residential side, the markets were terrible.  Business was very bad.  However, they all said that the commercial side was booming so much that it more than made up for their weakness on the residential side so that business tended to still be pretty good. In contrast to President Poole’s comment about trucking, I had one trucking CEO who said actually that business was good.  It was weak in the Northeast—shipments were down there—but in the South and West their business was picking up and doing pretty well.  He also made an interesting comment that I had not really thought about.  He said that part of the change in trucking is that, while volumes may be down and they are having trouble finding drivers, there has also been a revolution in packaging.  In fact, even though trucking volumes are down, the value of products and goods being shipped is actually up.  As an example, they used to ship the big boom boxes that people listened to music on; now they’re shipping iPods.  So as packaging has become more efficient and more protective, the truck volume is less, but the value is actually higher.  He said that this was an ongoing trend in the trucking industry and that one had to be careful about interpreting volumes. On the inflation front, manufacturers continue to report higher production costs, but these cost increases have been less widespread than recent surveys indicated.  Indexes of prices paid and prices received have continued to climb, and they’re still above where we’d like to see them. On the national side, my outlook has changed very little since our last meeting.  Compared with earlier this year, growth has weakened, as we all know and have discussed.  Housing slowed a little faster than perhaps we anticipated but—I agree with President Lacker—the prospects of spillovers remain relatively low.  Again, as Bill applauded Janet’s wonderful one-handed/two- handed presentation, the labor markets are sending a completely different signal.  As I said earlier, manufacturers and employers in our region continue to find scarcity in the labor market, both skilled and unskilled.  If we thought that the economy were weakening and we expected growth to remain appreciably below potential and weak for a number of additional quarters, it might be important to allow short-term interest rates to move down—but not because I think the Fed can do much to prop up growth in those circumstances, that is, to ride some kind of Phillips curve.  After all, businesses say there’s ample liquidity, and mortgage rates remain relatively low.  But because equilibrium market rates may be lower over a sustained period, we might want to see a fed funds rate that’s consistent with that.  This would be particularly relevant if we were sanguine about inflation. However, in my view, we’re not in that situation yet. As has been alluded to, many market commentators have pointed to the inversion of the yield curve as an indicator that recession is probable, but as suggested by the Chairman and the research that has been done, some of it by the Board staff, the predictive power of changes in the slope of the yield curve depends on why the slope of the yield curve changes.  The change in the slope of the yield curve suggested by the research that was alluded to earlier has been about 100 basis points, but about half of that has been in the risk premium associated with long-term rates.  At the same time, the predictive content of that risk premium change for recession or GDP growth is much less than absolute changes in real rates.  So I take that research to say that the inversion of the yield curve may be forecasting slower growth but not a recession to date. Thus, inflation remains a significant concern to me.  Recent readings on headline inflation have shown some encouraging downward movement, and inflation expectations have remained stable.  But the level of core inflation continues to be higher than what I consider to be consistent with price stability.  Moreover, the forecast does not show us reestablishing price stability in the near future.  That’s a reasonable, although unwelcome, forecast to the extent that very accommodative monetary policy over the past five years helped fuel the acceleration of inflation and that monetary policy and financial markets have not tightened much and aren’t expected to tighten much over the coming period.  The Bluebook indicates that the current real fed funds rate is within the range of model-based estimates of the equilibrium rate—that is, policy is not terribly tight—and, as I suggested earlier, long rates including mortgage rates are at relatively low levels, suggesting ample liquidity in the market. I’m not convinced that price stability will be achieved without further action on the part of the Fed, and I’d feel more comfortable after seeing a few more months or even another quarter or two of deceleration.  The slight deceleration in core inflation that we have seen, coupled with the slower economic growth, has meant that implicit firming of policy even without a change in the nominal funds rate might be in the cards, and that would be a welcome change.  I’m not convinced that the recent decline in energy prices will provide the relief we would like to see in core inflation. As suggested by Jeff and my question earlier, I’m concerned that, if oil prices stabilize around $60 a barrel, we will see core inflation begin to creep back up once the temporary benefits of the decline have disappeared.  Indeed, gasoline prices have already risen somewhat in the past few weeks from the lows that we saw in late September and early October.  As has been mentioned, the sharpest increases in the components of inflation that we’ve looked at over the past few months seem to be in those elements that are least likely to be influenced by energy prices.  In addition, as Jeff said, I’m very dubious that the gap measures that we allude to periodically are going to act as much of a constraint on price increases going forward.  The bottom line is that I’m not hopeful that energy prices or the output gap will provide us with much of the inflationary relief that we’re looking for. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"282";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have to begin by saying that Janet Yellen, without doubt, has provided the most brilliant exposition of “on the one hand and on the other hand.”  [Laughter],   I think I may be able to clarify the Wal-Mart outlook a bit.  There’s been a lot of publicity that Wal-Mart reported November year-over-year same store sales to be, I think, 0.1 percentage point down.  The Wal-Mart take on the situation is that the problem is about 75 percent in the forecast that they had and about 25 percent that sales are actually coming in a little weaker than forecast.  The big miss is that, in the year-over-year comparisons, there’s an enduring effect that was larger than they had earlier realized of the sales in the hurricane-affected regions.  People whose homes were destroyed went out and bought toasters, apparel, and all sorts of other things to replace the stuff that they lost, and that pumped up year-ago sales.  They’re expecting that effect to continue to affect year-over-year comparisons through March, obviously tapering off.  The other thing that they note—and this I think is perhaps a little more problematic—is that they continue to open lots of stores.  They know that the store locations in some cases cannibalize sales from existing stores.  So when they try to make allowance for those things, they say that October and probably also in November, although they haven’t completed that analysis, would have been about 3.8 percent above, year over year.  They would have expected on this basis 4.5 percent to 5 percent.  So they are running below the expectation.  The overall impression of the holiday season is that it’s going to be good but not great.  On the average shopping basket, the prices for goods sold are up about 1.1 percent year over year.  Wal-Mart does not see much inflation pressure.  They expect to be seeking price cuts from suppliers.  Apparently consumer product companies generally adjust prices in the first quarter of the year, and they end up negotiating with Wal-Mart, and Wal-Mart is expecting to ask for some price reductions.  A contact with a major money center bank indicates that their analysis of their credit card activity suggests that year-over-year retail sales have decelerated a little.  They expect the holiday retail season to be okay but not great. My contact at UPS said in a conversation last week that the Christmas season has been somewhat slow to materialize in terms of volume since Thanksgiving.  When I talked with him yesterday afternoon, he said that probably most of that was a consequence of weather, which delayed their volume.  Perhaps more interesting, UPS is expecting international volume to be up 11 percent in 2007 compared with 2006.  Their ’06 over ’05 output was 19.4 percent; 19 to 11 is a significant decline in growth.  For domestic express, they’re expecting ’07—I guess the annual average—to be up 1.2 percent over ’06; the ’06 over ’05 comparison was 4.8 percent.  So the deceleration in ’07 is significant.  On the labor front, they don’t have any particular issue, and they’re not having labor availability issues.  My FedEx contact had a similar outlook.  FedEx has somewhat downgraded its expectation for next year.  Again, he said that the company is starting to see momentum softening “as many others are.” The most downbeat contact was a large trucking firm.  He started off by saying that “things are pretty slow.”  He said that the trucking business never had a third-quarter or fourth-quarter peak. They just didn’t have a shipping peak.  He said their customers are not too concerned.  Shipping rates are down 4 to 5 percent year over year, and they’ve actually cut pay for new drivers.  They had increased it back in July.  They put the new driver pay back where it had been before, and they have also been laying off some drivers.  I guess that’s the main thing.  The company is not buying any new trucks next year. I have a couple of comments on the outlook.  To me the only way to reconcile what we see going on in the equity and the bond markets is that the markets together are anticipating declining inflation pressure and continued good economic growth.  One market or the other may be making a mistake, but if you want to assume that they’re well-informed people making good estimates, then it seems to me that’s the way to reconcile those observations.  My view of the Greenbook forecast is that it’s very sensible.  My own assessment is that outcomes above or below the forecast on both output and inflation have roughly equal probabilities; they’ve cut it right down the middle.  It makes good sense.  Both the Greenbook and the Blue Chip and other forecasters have been reducing their forecasts for ’07.  If you look at the Greenbook, Part 1, page 23, there’s a nice chart of how the forecast has come down over this year.  That’s all for me right now.  Thank you.,   One possibility would be to say that the markets might believe that we will be perfectly okay with inflation continuing to run 2¼, 2½, or something like that.  That is a possibility.  But the way I would look at it is that the market would probably believe that we would be just holding the fed funds rate target constant in that situation.  To have a market forecast of a declining fed funds rate, which is what’s in the bond market, it seems to me that you have to be anticipating that rates will come down.  Now, I think that can’t be a recession outlook because otherwise the equity market wouldn’t be as strong as it is.  So that’s why I came to that conclusion. One market or the other may be making a mistake, but I was saying that’s what I think is the best explanation of what the market sees."
"283";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Two or three developments in the District economy are worth noting, and they seem consistent, by the way, with what’s happening at the national level.  First, overall, the labor markets, excluding construction, appear to be continuing to improve.  Hiring is expanding, and the availability of jobs appears to be growing.  Some of that growth is no doubt seasonal, but my impression is that it goes beyond the typical seasonal increase of this time of year.  Second, housing sales of both new and existing homes appear to be stabilizing in year-over-year comparisons.  That is clearly a favorable development.  However, I think the adjustment in residential construction activity likely still has some considerable distance to go.  Numerous projects are under way; many of them are in midstream.  So the inventory of unsold homes, particularly of condominiums, is likely to remain high for the foreseeable future, and I think the implication is that no sizable new projects will be getting under way any time soon. As far as the national economy is concerned, I agree with the pattern in the Greenbook of gradually improving growth in economic activity after the current and perhaps the next quarter. But I continue to expect such growth to be a bit higher than expressed in the Greenbook for the reasons I’ve cited recently—sustained gains in employment, rising equity values, lower energy prices, moderate interest rates, and overall generally sound financial conditions.  Similarly, I wouldn’t quarrel very much with the Greenbook trajectory as far as it pertains to core inflation.  I think that, if this outlook is achieved, the outcome would not be at all bad, particularly if inflation diminishes a bit more quickly than it does in the forecast.  Unfortunately it’s hard at the moment to see the precursors of such a development, and the lower dollar is not likely to help. However, I’m not alarmed by the unemployment rate at 4½ percent, and I wonder if we’re getting another test of the ex-ante value of the NAIRU in forecasting inflation.  [Laughter] As to the risks to economic growth, some of the recent data, although not those pertaining to the labor market, have been on the soft side relative to my expectation.  The persistent inversion of the Treasury yield curve has my attention as well, perhaps belatedly.  But it’s hard to know with any confidence what to make of the latter factor, given hypotheses about saving gluts, asset shortages, and so forth.  Moreover, other approaches beyond analysis of the yield curve to estimate the probability of recessions generally provide figures that are quite low.  The underlying resilience of the economy adds to my confidence that business activity is likely to improve rather than deteriorate from here.  I would add that I am not hearing any of the negative anecdotes that I heard in late 2000 before the onset of the 2001 recession.  Thank you."
"284";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me confine my remarks to a couple of discussions of the economy that bolster the themes that several of you have noted.  At the outset, I’ll say that I continue to be more concerned with the level of inflation and our progress regarding it than I am with growth.  The economy appears to be on track, and I think, unlike the Greenbook projections, that there’s a prospect for some upside surprises on growth.  So let me spend a few moments looking at the labor markets, the corporate profit markets, household balance sheets, and consumer spending before coming back to the capital markets a little more broadly. First, on the labor market side, as has been noted previously, we continue to have surprisingly strong job gains, particularly at this point in the cycle.  The trend on revisions, regardless of the data series, tends to be continuing upward.  The labor markets continue to accept new workers into the labor force more smoothly, with the participation rate the highest since 2003, which suggests a dynamism in that market.  Hiring plans of small businesses have moved to their highest level in nearly two years and tend to be a pretty good forward-looking indicator, perhaps a better indicator than large companies.  In light of all that, I think the Greenbook rightly acknowledges that the household survey may imply even greater strength than the payroll data suggest. Second, turning to the profits picture, there continue to be remarkable profits for the S&P, the Dow, and the broader markets, predicated on strong cash flows and record profit margins.  Broad-based NIPA profits are up 30 percent pre-tax for the third quarter.  S&P delivered 20 percent profit gains in the third quarter.  I think the trend there is particularly telling. That is, estimates by earnings analysts continue to surprise on the upside.  As we move through the quarter, those bottom-up estimates continue to track very, very positively.  I think that’s probably a good indication of why we’ve seen equity prices increase.  When we look at where estimates are for the fourth quarter, bottom-up estimates for the S&P 500 are at about 9.1 percent.  For 2007, year-over-year increases of about 9.3 percent are expected.  These numbers are very strong, but they are significantly down from the high double-digit numbers that we’ve seen over the past couple of quarters.  My own sense is that continues to suggest good news for the equity markets and good news for corporate profits.  I expect that equity prices will outperform over the next couple of months if the numbers move up from 9 percent into the double digits.  If that trend is reversed and we see disappointing corporate earnings, we could see a pretty rapid pullback in the equity markets, with some implications for the broader economy.  I mention this discussion of profits and recognize that, though there is some correlation between corporate profits and the broader economy, we are continuing to see a disproportionate share of total income coming from this sector.  So it’s a sector that we need to continue to evaluate. Third, turning to household balance sheets, net worth grew $3½ trillion over the past four quarters, as the Fed’s flow of funds data suggest.  Assets are growing faster than liabilities, whether we include or exclude housing, if we look at just the past four quarters.  Continuing remarkable levels of household and corporate liquidity continue to suggest very good news. Although in these data we do see growth of household debt relative to income, this is a trend over the past twenty-five years, and I don’t really note anything overly disturbing there.  So when we look at those three measures—labor, profits, and balance sheets—I come to a pretty encouraging conclusion in terms of an underlying sturdiness to the economy, particularly in regard to individual consumption. Let me turn to consumption, with a bit of a short-term focus here on the fourth quarter.  I think the Greenbook suggested anecdotally that November might turn out to be a little softer than October and a little softer than expectations.  My own sense is that some real upside surprises are there.  I had discussions with contacts and reviewed data from two large credit card companies, which in total represent about 35 percent of all of consumer buying over this period.  This real- time information ends in November and looks across demographics.  It excludes subprime lenders:  The only subprime folks in these two portfolios are those who began in the primary market and found their way into the subprime market.  So I recognize that we are missing an important piece.  However, when you look at consumer spending for November, you see little to no deterioration in credit quality—credit is still incredibly strong across regions and income groups.  I pushed each of the two companies to find areas of weakness, and they found this exercise to be pretty tough.  Their own internal credit measures have not shifted.  They had built in some softening in November and December Christmas spending, which they have not seen. They continue to see a huge reservoir of untapped credit, and they do see some de-leveraging by folks in key consumer groups, which they think suggests that consumers are in very good shape. The consumer spending trend from these two contacts continues to be very positive.  They expected to see growth in November on the order of 4 percent; they saw growth of 5½ and 6 percent.  Though it’s too early to call this Christmas season a success, they are much more positive than they were before November began, in terms of both dollar purchases and transaction swipes.  So my own sense is that the consumer appears to be quite strong. Having now listed four areas that I think have rather remarkable strength, I want to spend a moment on another topic that has been discussed around this table, which is manufacturing.  As we look at the manufacturing base and we try to evaluate how we will know which inflection point the economy turns on, the manufacturing data are likely to be quite telling.  I’ve been surprised and disappointed by poor manufacturing ISM (Institute for Supply Management) data and other weak data, and I’ve asked myself whether the weakness shows some spreading beyond autos and housing, which we’ve all discussed for some time.  When I look behind those data, I am comfortable that much of the weakness that we see in manufacturing really is consistent with that theme—that is, second-order and third-order suppliers into the auto and housing sectors. Other weakness does appear to be related to certain machinery and equipment, but I have seen that weakness more in the data than in the anecdotes.  As President Minehan suggested, I think that these data end up being somewhat weak, but the weakness is transitory.  The share prices of most of these large multinational manufacturing companies continue to outperform.  The tone that these companies have when they’re meeting with their analysts continues to be quite positive, so this signal may well be false, but we have to focus a bit more on it.  By the time we meet in the first quarter we’ll have a better sense of whether the manufacturing base, in terms of volume and productivity, is giving us any indication of what’s happening in the broader economy. Let me turn, finally, to the capital markets.  Capital markets, as has been mentioned around this table, continue to function well.  The Board staff has rightly observed that long-term forward corporate credit spreads are widening somewhat, showing that these markets, while awash in liquidity, are responding to price signals and are starting to focus increasingly on credit. In a couple of instances, issuers that tried to come to market, both in Europe and in the United States, were beaten back, which was, frankly, good news from the perspective of market discipline.  The securities that they were trying to issue were PIK notes.  These are paid-in-kind securities by which the company can pay off the investors either in cash or through additional paper, and the pool of liquidity for such notes is not so deep.  That kind of discipline in the markets should encourage us.  Having said that, I consider the debt capital markets to be incredibly robust.  I talked previously about remarkable pipelines that were at record levels. They have all now priced at significantly beneficial terms.  In November, as I think Dino noted, high-yield corporate issuances were at a record.  The leveraged-loan market was also at a record, and we found instances in which issuers obtained better terms by issuing in larger volumes.  That tells us that some people in the investor base really want to get their full allocations.  If they can get their allocations, they’re willing to pay a premium for doing so.  The backlogs priced remarkably well, and I think those markets are functioning well. Let me enter the discussion about trying to reconcile the bond markets and the equity markets by making four points.  First, the leveraged buyout data that Dino discussed are one explanation.  That is, you don’t need to have a leveraged buyout of a vast majority or of even a significant number of companies in the S&P for those values to find their way into the markets. My view is that an LBO floor valuation now exists across more sectors than we could have anticipated before—into technology, for example—and companies that, because of their size, were previously out of reach for the private equity players.  Part of the growth that we’ve seen in the equity markets has occurred because the LBO prices that could theoretically be paid, with balance sheets that are probably much less conservative, have raised the prices that are paid in the capital markets for these same companies.  Second, the difference between the equity and the bond markets is about earnings growth and not multiples growth.  On a price-to-earnings basis, the suggestion is that earnings in 2007 will be up something like 9 percent over this year, and the price-earnings multiples don’t look out of whack.  You end up with earnings that, if they are delivered for another year or two, don’t make these companies look all that expensive.  Third, in reconciling these markets, I’d suggest that the difference is really about us.  The markets think that, if the trajectory for the economy softens significantly, the Fed will be responsive to it, notwithstanding what we’re saying currently—that dependence on the data means that we will be agile and we won’t be stuck in our words of yesterday in judging the economy that’s forthcoming.  So they believe that we will effectively lower rates to achieve a very soft but successful landing.  Finally, expectations are built into the bond markets that rate cuts are ahead. The discount rate in evaluating cash flows for these companies obviously comes down as well, further bolstering their value.  So I suspect that these markets are perhaps a bit more consistent than some market prognosticators would say.  But we must continue to evaluate them over the next several weeks and months.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   It’s a tough question, and I’ll try to take it in turn, which is that most of the liquidity phenomenon that I describe here and that we see in the U.S. markets, we describe in the FOMC as a U.S. phenomenon, but it’s really a global phenomenon.   So as we think about what this liquidity tells us about interest rates, it’s hard to draw a certain conclusion.  That is, these markets are increasingly global.  The U.S. multinational financial companies that are successful in having access to capital in worldwide markets can take companies public in worldwide markets.  So even if you believe that the Fed was too loose or overly accommodative, we’re somewhat limited in what we can do to stem that worldwide liquidity for the reasons that you mentioned. When I talk about liquidity, moreover, I’m suggesting partly the first explanation that you gave, which is that there is access to capital, which has been described around this table as free money, by more people in more investments that might not otherwise be satisfying a strict return on investment or return on equity basis.  So we’re seeing not only smart capital from folks with long track records who have entered this market and can deploy their investment dollars but also folks with less experience who can finance themselves particularly in the debt markets in a way that was unimaginable in previous cycles.  So I think liquidity really means a couple of the things you’ve noted.  Obviously, I, like you, think that these monetary aggregates are not providing us with much insight.  Moreover, regarding your initial point, we would have a hard time drying up this liquidity, if that’s what we attempted to do, given the global nature of the sources and the uses of funds."
"285";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d start today talking a bit about housing markets and the condition of banks right now.  As many of you have noticed, some of us are optimistic that we may be approaching a bottom in the housing market.  I think we’ll see that bottom in housing sales long before we see it on the construction side because there’s a large amount of inventory still to work through.  But as we’ve noted, the applications for purchasing mortgages have been level since midyear.  The growth in mortgage credit has slowed significantly from where it was in the past two years, dropping to only 10 percent growth this past quarter, a growth rate that is significantly above the growth of personal income and that most of us in the past would have considered to be alarming. Part of what’s amazing in all of this is that in 2004 and 2006, particularly toward the end of that period, purchase money seconds, by which people borrowed the downpayments for homes, were a big part of mortgage financing.  Banks are still getting some of this business and putting it on their balance sheets, and it is part of the growth of what you’re seeing the banks funding.  But it is at a pace that I think needs to be adjusted.  I’m saying that, although the number of applications may have bottomed out, the amount of leverage in each housing deal may still need some correction going forward, and so we may see some slowdown in the volume of dollars that are funded through mortgage lending. Delinquency rates are really, really low by historical standards.  The one sector that has had a jump in delinquencies is subprime ARMs, and clearly the jump is related to rates that have already reset.  We’ve got more to come.  Even though these have jumped, they’re still not at alarming levels.  But it’s something that I think the banks are watching very, very carefully. One thing I’m hearing more from some folks who have been investing in mortgage- backed securities and maybe in some CDOs (collateralized debt obligations), where they’ve been tranched into riskier positions through economic leverage, is the realization that a lot of the private mortgages that have been securitized during the past few years really do have much more risk than the investors have been focusing on.  I’m hearing this from folks who understand that the quality of what goes into those pools varies tremendously when you don’t have the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac framework for the underwriting.  When a mortgage is originated through a bank, we do a lot through safety and soundness supervision to make sure, if a bank is buying loans from brokers, that the loans are underwritten in a sound manner and are therefore affordable to the borrower when they’re undertaken.  We’re seeing that some of the private-label mortgage-backed securities are having very high early default rates or delinquencies in the mortgages, which usually means that the originator has to buy them back out of the pools.  There isn’t a whole lot of transparency in the disclosures around some of these bonds, and some of the brokers are underwriting products that have very high early default rates, which is something that investors are starting to focus on.  As more products are generated outside the banking sector, they get funneled to pools through broker-dealers as opposed to the banks.  I think that we’re missing a level of due diligence regarding brokers, who may not be doing a good job.  As you all know, the fraud rate on mortgages has tripled in the past two years.  So I think we could see noise in some of the mortgage-backed private deals and some of the riskier CDO economic leverage positions. Bank earnings are really, really strong overall, especially by historical standards.  Banks are making a lot of layoffs connected with the mortgage business.  They are taking steps to get costs—whether related to originations, post-loan closings, or payoff administration—under control.  Net interest margins, however, continue to be under significant pressure.  I’m hearing more from banks that, since we’ve stopped raising rates, they’ve lost the nice little lag effect— the ability to wait for us to move before lagging along.  In other words, they have lost that lagniappe in their liability cost that has helped them with their margin pressures.  So those pressures are going to be more of a challenge for them, especially with a flat or inverted yield curve, depending on where they’re funding and lending.  Loan-loss provision continues to be the best in many, many years.  No one really expects it to jump, but clearly it can’t get a whole lot better than it is, and so that will also present challenges going forward. As for the economy as a whole, I, too, want to compliment President Yellen because I think she did a fantastic job of helping us think about the different signals we’re getting.  When I looked again at the graph that I love in the Greenbook that shows where our forecast has been, I was struck that we’ve seen the forecast of GDP growth continuing to moderate in the past several months but our expectations of inflation are actually flat to up a bit.  To me that raises questions about the tradeoff that we really have when we are running below capacity and below potential growth rates.  The bit of softness that I’m hearing about from some of my contacts in sectors outside housing and mortgages warns me that we need to be a little more vigilant than I had been expecting about growth maybe softening in a broader sense.  But the fact that inflation continues to be above 2 percent in the forecast period is something that does concern me, and I think part of my concern relates to the tremendous amount of liquidity that sits out there in the banking sector, in the U.S. financial markets, and clearly globally.  The presence of this liquidity is something that we really need to think about.  It’s not back to where it was in my money supply days, when I started my career at the St. Louis Fed; but I do worry that liquidity is, as some of you have said, causing a lot of transactions to occur that economically perhaps wouldn’t otherwise occur.  That is also something we need to watch very carefully."
"286";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  It’s not fair.  [Laughter]  Well, to the extent that this sounds like North Dakota, let me just proceed.  Despite data from the housing markets that suggest that New England is suffering the real estate slowdown perhaps more than the rest of the nation—at least in terms of falling house prices—the overall regional economy appears to be doing fairly well.  This is the bimodal model that a couple of people have talked about.  Moderate employment growth continues. Layoffs are down, and electronic job postings, as opposed to newspaper want ads, are rising. Retailers are cautious about the fallout from the housing market, but except for those in the hardware or furniture businesses, sales were reportedly buoyed by the drop in gasoline prices. Indeed, October saw the first year-over-year decline in gas prices in the Boston area in four years. Manufacturing overall has been running ahead of last year, with aircraft, energy, and scientific equipment particularly robust.  Growth in high-tech and biotech service companies remains strong; and while wage growth overall is slightly below national levels, salaries for higher-skilled staff with professional degrees are being bid up, reflecting strong demand.  Consumer confidence is solid, especially regarding future conditions, and I’ve seen the same thing that President Moskow commented on—the optimism of business contacts.  Business confidence as measured by local organizations has been on a steady upward trend since June, with employers significantly more positive about national economic conditions, the rising stock market, falling energy prices, and favorable interest rates.  The mild fall weather, although a major problem for the early ski season, boosted tourism, which is reportedly going gangbusters—that’s a technical term—in Boston and other areas.  Convention sites are booked ahead, and hotel rates are rising. The regional housing market continues on the downside.  Sales of existing homes declined 20 percent from their year-earlier peaks, and inventories and time on the market continue to rise. Prices of existing homes were down in New England overall for the first six months of the year and down again from Q2 to Q3 for three of the six states, according to the OFHEO index.  Moreover, new housing permits were down 13 percent, and the dollar value of construction contracts was off sharply.  However, New England’s market for new construction is small, and as near as we can see, not much speculative building occurred during the boom.  Thus, homebuilder finances remain in relatively reasonable shape.  There will likely be write-offs for suppliers this winter and perhaps some consolidation in the local industry, but we don’t see many major local economic effects from this.  On the positive side, price-level declines have the welcome effect of making regional housing stock, particularly housing in the Boston area, more affordable.  Suppliers and bankers noted that they saw signs of a modest pickup in sales in September and October, and they look forward to a brighter spring season if mortgage rates stay at their current lows. Commercial real estate remains a very different world, however.  In fact, comments regarding commercial real estate investment in a number of cities around New England have served to highlight the liquidity that continues to characterize debt and asset markets, driving the yields lower, keeping spreads tight, and moving prices of even unlikely assets higher.  In the notes from our Beige Book contacts was a very interesting conversation with a commercial real estate firm in Hartford, Connecticut, which has long been a depressed area.  The contact reported that Hartford was attracting institutional investment interest for the first time since the 1980s and that commercial real estate deals were being done with cap rates of 7 to 8 percent.  Providence reported similar commercial real estate strength; and in Boston, cap rates were said to be a bit below 6 percent. Pricing action in Boston remained above replacement cost with inflows of funds for deals reportedly from Middle Eastern and Irish sources.  Vacancy rates in Boston are down.  Rental rates are up, and pressure to serve the growth of new biotech firms is reportedly creating hot commercial real estate markets in Cambridge and in suburban areas just west of the city.  While hot commercial real estate markets in eastern Massachusetts and even Providence are not particularly new news, such interest in Hartford really is.  On the one hand, investor interest in places like Hartford may be a sign of real overheating.  On the other hand, if the lid stays on, areas like Hartford stand to benefit from a rise in investment and, one hopes, related job growth. Turning to the nation, the recent tone of the incoming data, especially on the manufacturing side, has been subdued, as declines in the housing market and in motor vehicle spending and production have taken their toll.  But I think this tone may well result from the ebb and flow of high-frequency observations.  At the time of our last meeting, incoming data seemed more positive overall, and many of the factors present then—including solid employment growth, low unemployment, healthy debt and equity markets, solid corporate profits, good foreign growth, and a less negative or even a neutral-to-positive effect of net exports—remain.  Fourth-quarter GDP data may well be disappointing to the markets, but given both what the staff believes is a calculation error on the part of the BEA and the fact that so many supportive factors remain, I am hopeful about prospects for ’07 and ’08. Our forecast in Boston retains the same trajectory as the Greenbook’s—a slow fourth quarter and a growing rebound over the next couple of years as residential investment recovers combined with a gradual small uptick in unemployment and an ebb in core inflation to the low 2s. Thus, despite the sense in markets that momentum has shifted downward, I don’t think that the baseline outlook has changed much since our last meeting, and the Greenbook forecast reflects that pretty well.  Similarly, although risks exist both that growth will be slower and that inflation will be faster, I believe those risks to be fairly balanced at this point, though they are certainly not minor. Of concern, however, is the cost of being wrong on the inflation side.  This is certainly not the time to let down our guard on this front with labor markets fairly tight, the unemployment rate at 4½ percent, and most of the downward effect of declining energy prices behind us.  We could see inflation move sideways rather than down, and that could well be an issue.  Markets see us beginning to ease as soon as the late first quarter, early second.  Perhaps they’re right, but I remain to be convinced by the incoming data.  Thank you."
"287";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for the economy hasn’t changed much since our last meeting, but I have become more concerned about the risk to the outlook for real growth.  So in my comments this morning, I’ll explain why my risk assessment has changed. The homebuilders with whom I spoke over the past several weeks told me that the low interest rates and the new financial products created an environment in which they did five years’ worth of business in the space of three years.  They said that most homebuilders recognized that this pace of activity was unsustainable and so they planned accordingly.  A few small builders have declared bankruptcy, and others still may do so; but for the most part, builders feel that they are financially prepared to make it through the next one or two years of poor business.  So the financial condition of homebuilders is not my chief concern. However, I have become more worried about the potential spillover of housing conditions into consumer spending from wealth effects, income constraints, and creditworthiness.  I think I’m going to give the counterpoint to President Lacker on these issues.  The Greenbook points out that the OFHEO price index is still increasing a bit, but the builders I met with convinced me that the published prices for new homes don’t accurately reflect market conditions.  Sellers are offering nonprice concessions, such as upgrades for appliances, carpets, fixtures, and so forth.  Some builders are going to great lengths to keep published prices up.  I’ve been told stories of builders in Arizona who have been giving buyers new Lexuses as part of the overall deal so that they don’t have to bring down the prices in their subdivision.  Also, it seems as though owners of existing homes are not yet willing to reduce their asking prices by very much.  With potential buyers still waiting for prices to fall further, traffic levels and transactions are low.  It seems as though markets are not yet close to functioning smoothly, and homebuilders are telling me that it could take another year before buyers and sellers exhibit more confidence.  I am concerned that we don’t yet have a good handle on where house prices are headed and how the uncertainties surrounding house prices might affect consumer spending.  Second, the support to consumption provided by cash-out refinancing is not likely to be available going forward to the same degree that we’ve had during the past several years.  Finally, the financial condition of some households has become pretty fragile, and we all know that rates on adjustable mortgages, including some subprime mortgage loans, continue to reset at higher rates.  The adjustable rate mortgages are already causing some well- publicized problems for some households. Builders in my region report that the ability of potential homebuyers to qualify for home mortgages is becoming an issue.  One homebuilder from Columbus told me that he is giving away new cars as well, but his motivation provides a twist on the Lexus story.  Some of his customers are struggling to qualify for mortgage loans.  So he’s giving them new cars so that they can get rid of their current cars and the payment obligations that go along with them.  [Laughter]  He’s not giving them a Lexus; he’s giving them a Kia.  [Laughter]  Now, if we could get these homebuilders to adopt a Buy American strategy, we might also be able to solve our domestic auto problem. As I said at the outset, I don’t have a major disagreement with the Greenbook baseline.  I think that the outlook for near-term growth has deteriorated a little since October, and the Greenbook reflects that.  I just think that there’s greater likelihood that the real economy could prove to be weaker than the baseline in the Greenbook in 2007, and the key risk in my view is the degree of spillover from the housing market into the rest of the economy.  The Greenbook’s extended house decline alternative scenario represents this risk, although I have not yet heard stories that are quite as dramatic as the 20 percent decline in home prices in that scenario. Not much has changed, as many others have already commented, in the inflation outlook. The inflation trend continues to be hard to interpret, but I still expect core inflation to drift down gradually over the forecast period.  Although there is still a risk that inflation will remain higher than I desire, I think that favorable compensation developments and declines in shelter costs could speed that rate of decline.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"288";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have to admit that this time around I found it pretty challenging to read the tea leaves on economic activity.  The data are providing distinctly contradictory signals.  For example, several key indicators of aggregate spending have come in below expectations, and the Greenbook now sees real GDP growth this quarter and the next averaging a mere 1½ percent.  At the same time, the labor market continues to be strong and shows no clear signs of weakening, as evidenced by the November employment report.  The latest information on inflation has been fairly favorable; but even with some signs of easing, the underlying trend in core consumer price inflation remains above my comfort zone. The last time we met I described the situation as a bimodal economy with strength in most sectors and weakness limited to just two sectors, housing and domestic auto production.  This description by and large remains apt.  The correction in the housing sector has continued, even sharpening somewhat compared with our expectations.  Still, there are some encouraging signs that the demand for housing may be stabilizing, probably assisted by recent declines in mortgage rates. After a precipitous fall, home sales appear to have leveled off.  In addition, equity valuations for homebuilders have continued to rise in the past couple of months, suggesting that the outlook for these businesses may be improving.  Finally, the gap between housing prices and fundamentals may not be as large as some calculations suggest because real long-term interest rates have fallen quite a bit recently, raising the fundamental value of housing.  That said, the housing sector on balance is a source of downside risk, and the risk could be magnified if mortgage rates were to rise again as foreseen by the Greenbook. Outside residential investment, GDP growth has remained solid.  Consumption has continued to be strong; indeed, I think there are upside risks to consumer spending, given the Greenbook’s forecast of a significant rise in the saving rate.  But recent indicators of nonresidential investment and activity in the manufacturing sector have come in below expectations.  The key question is whether these data hint at a crack in the economy’s armor that could widen.  It’s obviously too early to tell, but these weaknesses bear careful monitoring. Overall, the data on spending paint a clear picture of an economy growing well below trend, but it seems as though the BEA hasn’t delivered this message to the BLS.  [Laughter]  The very latest data show payroll employment growing steadily.  The household data are even more alarming. The unemployment rate has declined ½ percentage point over the past year and now stands at 4½ percent, ½ percentage point below our estimate of the NAIRU.  My business contacts tell me the same thing.  Labor markets are tight, and jobs are hard to fill, especially for skilled positions.  But some other indicators suggest that labor markets may have softened a bit.  In particular, the Conference Board index of job market perceptions, based on a survey of households, declined in both October and November.  This index is historically very highly correlated with the unemployment rate, but now it’s sending a different signal, suggesting that labor markets are roughly in balance.  Similarly, in November fewer firms reported openings that are hard to fill. The fall in the unemployment rate this year is hard to square with Okun’s law.  Over the past four quarters, GDP growth has averaged 3 percent, just 0.3 above the Board’s estimate of potential GDP growth.  A standard Okun’s law calculation suggests that this should have led to a decline in the unemployment rate of only about 0.1 percentage point.  In fact, however, it declined 0.5 percentage point.  Of course, labor markets do adjust with a lag, so we may just need to be patient and wait for Okun’s law to reassert itself as assumed in the Greenbook forecast.  An alternative possibility is that the output gap is more positive than assumed in the Greenbook because of lower growth in potential output or more-rapid growth in actual output.  In his presentation, David noted the possibility that the growth rate of potential output may be lower than even the downwardly revised estimate in the Greenbook.  It is also possible—and, in fact, there are indications—that actual output growth may have been faster than the pace reflected in measured GDP.  Growth in domestic income has outpaced GDP growth by ¾ percentage point over the past year.  Now I know that when someone mentions the statistical discrepancy, eyes start to glaze over. But I raise this issue because it could have important implications for the outlook.  If the gross domestic income measure ends up being more accurate, then the decline in the unemployment rate this year would not be surprising.  Going forward, more-rapid output growth would imply a lower path for unemployment, potentially adding to inflation pressures. Turning to inflation itself, the news has been pretty good on balance since our last meeting. We expect core PCE price inflation to edge down from just under 2½ percent this year to about 2 percent in 2008.  We came to this forecast balancing two main pieces of news.  On the one hand, recent labor market data point to a lower path for the unemployment rate than before, and all else being equal, this boosts our inflation forecast a bit.  Offsetting this effect, on the other hand, is the huge downward revision in compensation per hour.  When these data came out, I let out a big sigh of relief.  The revised data are more consistent with the indications we were getting from the employment cost index and suggest that wage growth has remained contained.  In contrast, my contacts report intensifying wage pressures, resulting in part from more-frequent employee quits and outside offers.  Even so, my contacts do not report that these developments are exerting significant pressure on their profit margins or prices, suggesting continued strong productivity growth.  But that, in turn, conflicts with the data on productivity growth in the nonfarm business sector, which have been weak, not strong.  Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased only about 1½ percent over the past year, well below its trend.  But there is reason to believe that this decline may overstate the slowing in productivity growth, given continued strong growth in productivity in the nonfinancial corporate sector.  At least part of this discrepancy between nonfinancial corporate and nonfarm productivity growth reflects the gap I mentioned before between gross domestic income and gross domestic product.  If the GDI numbers are, in fact, more accurate, that alone could add nearly 1 percentage point to nonfarm business productivity growth, perhaps reconciling the reports by my contacts of intensifying wage pressure along with an absence of pressure on prices and margins. In summary, I continue to view a soft landing with moderating inflation as my best-guess forecast, conditional on maintaining the current stance of policy.  But there are sizable risks on both sides to the outlook for growth, and the downside risks are now more palpable.  There is, likewise, a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward; in this case, the risks remain biased to the high side.,   I read that as suggesting that the growth of actual output might be understated.  I suppose one could also contemplate the possibility that potential might be understated but I was hypothesizing that actual output is understated, and hence the gap between actual and potential may be larger than the Greenbook assumes.,   Thank you.  [Laughter]"
"289";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20061212meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our forecast hasn’t changed much since the last meeting.  We still expect growth to move back to potential in the first half of next year and to stay in the vicinity of potential, which we think is around 3 percent, over the forecast period.  We expect inflation, as measured by the core PCE index, to fall to just under 2 percent by the end of ’08. Our view of the outlook differs from the Greenbook in two respects, as it has over the past few cycles.  We have a higher estimate of potential growth, with the difference due to higher estimates of labor force growth, and we expect more moderation in inflation than the Greenbook does, principally because we believe there is less inertia, less persistence in inflation in the United States than does the staff.  Both these issues, of course, deserve continued analysis and attention by the Committee.  These differences in our forecast relative to the Greenbook don’t extend to the policy assumption.  Both outlooks are predicated on a likely path of the fed funds rate that’s nearly flat over the next several quarters.  This path, of course, is above the one currently reflected in financial markets.  Of course, although some disagreement between our view and the market’s view is not unusual, the size of this gap is significant enough to warrant some attention.  It’s hard to know, however, what the source of the difference is and, therefore, what the implications are for what we do in terms of policy. The risks to the forecast may have shifted somewhat in the direction of less upside risk to inflation and more downside risk to growth.  But to us, the current weakness in the economy still seems principally to stem from the direct effects of the slowdown in housing on construction activity and related parts of the manufacturing sector as well as from the reduction in automobile and auto-related production.  As things now stand, the softer-than-expected recent numbers don’t argue, in our view, for a substantial reassessment of the risks in the outlook.  Surveys of business sentiment outside the manufacturing sector still seem consistent with reasonable growth going forward.  A slowdown of investment in equipment and software doesn’t seem to be particularly troubling to us at this point.  Consumer spending seems to be growing at a fairly good pace. Employment growth, of course, is still quite solid, and growth outside the United States still looks pretty good. We think the fundamentals of the expansion going forward still look good, with strong household income growth even after the lagged effects of the recent downward revisions, productivity growth in the range of 2½ percent for the nonfinancial corporate sector, and strong corporate balance sheets in the United States, and prospects for continued expansion outside the United States.  Our recent financial market data don’t, in my view, provide a convincing case for a substantial increase in the probability of a much weaker path for growth going forward. Although the yield curve is inverted and long rates continue to drift down, staff research and other indicators suggest that part of that is due to a decline in term premiums, and forward rates seem to be coming down around the world still.  This gradual reduction in term premiums and forward real rates globally suggests that what we’re seeing in the long-term interest rates in the United States may not be principally a sign that confidence in the U.S. growth outlook has deteriorated. It’s not clear even 18 months after the conundrum first emerged whether equilibrium rates globally have really moved substantially lower.  The Bluebook estimate suggests we’re still within most estimates of equilibrium real rates in the United States.  Equity prices and credit spreads are consistent with the view of sustained expansion going forward.  All this seems to reinforce the case for the judgment that we have not yet induced overly restrictive financial conditions. We still face considerable uncertainty about the outlook for growth and the familiar sources of downside risk, but to us these still seem to rest mainly with the possibility that a more-acute and protracted fall in housing activity and prices will cause a significant deceleration in housing and household spending and ultimately business spending.  The nature of these risks, however, hasn’t changed in our view, and the probability that the risks will materialize may have risen a bit but not much.  On balance, this situation should reduce the probability that we’ll have to tighten further, but it doesn’t seem to suggest that today we need to induce a further easing in overall financial conditions. On the inflation front, we confront the familiar mix of underlying inflation still at uncomfortably high levels and considerable uncertainty about whether we’ll see enough moderation soon enough to keep expectations stable at reasonable levels.  The remaining inflation risks, in other words, are about whether we get enough moderation.  In the absence of a dramatically different outcome for the dollar and energy prices than what’s in the forecast, we don’t see much risk of inflation accelerating from current levels or remaining stuck at current levels.  We haven’t had much evidence to justify a significant change in the expected path of inflation or in the risks of that forecast.  The news on unit labor costs may be a bit reassuring. Surveys seem to suggest some evidence of diminishing pricing power, which might imply that margins will adjust downward to absorb future rises in labor compensation.  The odds of an early return to above-trend growth seem to have receded a bit.  Most of the alternative measures of underlying inflation that many of us look at seem to have moderated a bit after the sustained earlier period of acceleration.  Inflation expectations derived from TIPS have eased a bit.  These pieces of information are somewhat comforting, but they don’t change the fact that our expectation that we’ll achieve the desired moderation in inflation without further tightening of monetary policy remains just that.  It is an expectation or a hope; it is not yet reality.  Thank you."
"290";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Seeing that there are no further questions, I propose that we start the economic go-round.  Remember, we do have the two-handed option if anyone cares to exercise it.  President Yellen.,   Thank you.  President Moskow.,   I notice that they’re not playing in the Seventh Federal Reserve District, though.  [Laughter],   Thank you.  President Stern.,   Thank you.  President Minehan.,   Thank you.  President Minehan, just to clarify, I think that the forecast of consumption is not based on the idea that the saving rate has to rise.  Rather, consumption is modeled using underlying determinants, like income and wealth, and an endogenous indication of that is that saving rises.,   Anyway, you gave the impression that higher saving was itself something that was going to happen naturally.,   But the saving rate is not driving the consumption forecast. Rather, the consumption forecast is driving the saving rate.,   President Fisher.,   President Fisher, just a quick question.  I couldn’t quite gather whether you were saying that commercial construction is overall slowing.  You mentioned that once, but then you talked about a variety of projects.,   Thank you.

Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you.  This was an exceptionally interesting, useful discussion.  I thought I would try to summarize what I heard around the table.  If you have comments on that, please give them to me, and then I’ll add a few comments of my own. Members noted considerable economic strength during the intermeeting period.  Labor markets remain taut, with continuing wage pressures in some occupations.  Consumption grew strongly in the fourth quarter, with some momentum into the first quarter, reflecting a strong job market, lower energy prices, and higher profits.  Overall, investment seems likely to grow at a moderate pace given good fundamentals.  Business people seem generally optimistic, and financial markets are robust. We still have what people have been characterizing as a two-track economy.  Housing, although a drag for now, does show some tentative evidence of stabilization.  However, some warned about drawing too strong a conclusion about housing during the winter months.  Some also noted issues of credit quality.  The general view was that housing would cease to subtract from growth later this year.  Some softness in parts of manufacturing, especially in industries related to housing and automobiles, still exists.  But in part this weakness may be an inventory correction that may be reasonably far advanced at this point.  Despite the weakness in housing and some parts of manufacturing, there are yet no signs of spillover into employment or consumption, although some raised the possibility that we may see those later on.  Some, but not all, members agree with the contour of the Greenbook that has economic growth somewhat slower in the near term, strengthening later this year, with a modest increase in unemployment. The Committee is generally more optimistic about potential growth than the Greenbook, mostly because the members assume that labor force growth will be greater than the Greenbook assumes.  Overall, downside risks to output appear to have moderated, while an upside risk has emerged that growth will not moderate as expected. On the inflation side, people noted that recent readings have been favorable, although there was disagreement about the cause, whether it was energy prices, well-anchored inflation expectations, less structural inertia, or perhaps just statistical noise.  Most still expect gradually slowing inflation but are cautious and consider upside risk significant, perhaps even greater than late last year.  The primary upside risk to inflation is economic growth above potential in tight labor markets, which may lead to inflation in the future if not in the near term.  Others noted that inflation expectations may be too high to allow continued progress against inflation.  So overall, the general tone was for a somewhat stronger economy, perhaps a slightly improved outlook on inflation, but, in any case, a clear view that the upside risks to inflation are predominant.  Are there any comments? Let me add just a few points.  Everything has really been said, but not everyone has said it, as they say.  [Laughter]  Our goal has been, in some sense, to achieve a soft landing, and the question is whether we have missed the airport.  [Laughter]  We have seen a good bit of strength in the intermeeting period, and I think the real crux of the issue is what’s going to happen to the labor market.  If the labor market continues where it is or strengthens further, we will see both stronger growth, because of the income effects and job effects, and continued pressure on inflation.  Again, the central issue will be whether we will see enough cooling in the economy to have a bit of easing in the labor situation.  This is, obviously, difficult to say.  I do believe that the most likely outcome for the first half of this year is for some moderation in growth, perhaps to modestly below potential.   If you look at the various components of spending and production, you note, for example, that personal consumption expenditures are likely to slow from the very high levels we have just seen recently.  In particular, a lot of the spending recently was for durable goods, which tend to be more negatively auto-correlated—that is, they tend to drop more quickly when they are high in the short run.   We have seen some moderation in investment, in both equipment and structures.  Net exports were a major contributor to growth at the end of the year; that should probably reverse, as the Greenbook notes.  A special factor there is that the good weather reduced oil imports, which led people to spend on domestic production rather than on foreign production.  If that situation reverses and we go back to normal net exports, that will subtract from GDP.  Also, the staff noted some likely reversals in government spending.  So my sense is that we’re likely to see something a little less hectic in the first half of this current year. I think it also remains reasonable that growth will return close to potential later this year. There is certainly uncertainty about that.  Clearly, we have seen some signs of stabilization in the housing market.  I was going to note the effects of the winter months and the weather.  I think that we should acknowledge that stabilization but not ignore the possibility that we may see further deterioration there. Against the view that growth may moderate this quarter, or next quarter perhaps, there is opposing evidence that consumption and employment are awfully strong.  Economists tend to think of consumption, in particular, as being a very forward-looking variable, and it’s consistent with views that we see, for example, in consumer sentiment that people do feel reasonably optimistic about the labor market and about the state of the economy.  So I agree that there is certainly some risk that the economy will be stronger going forward than we have been projecting.  I don’t have an answer other than to say that we obviously have to monitor the situation very carefully and continue to be willing to reassess our views as the data arrive. Let me say a bit about inflation.  Recent readings have been favorable.  A couple of aspects of inflation I do find encouraging.  First is that the moderation we’ve seen in inflation the past few months has happened despite the lack of any substantial moderation in shelter costs. Owners’ equivalent rents are actually a constructed, imputed variable.  They are not seen by anybody.  Nevertheless, they are essentially the entire reason that inflation is remaining above our target zone at this point.  I know it’s a bit of a joke that I always refer to the short-term inflation numbers, but I’ll do it again anyway.  [Laughter]  Just to illustrate, over the past three months, core CPI inflation excluding just owners’ equivalent rent was 0.2 percent at an annual rate.  Over the past six months, it was 1.20 percent at an annual rate.  Over the past twelve months, it was 1.82.  We also get numbers for PCE core inflation excluding owners’ equivalent rents that are all below 2 percent.  Obviously that is just carving the data, and there are lots of problems with doing that.  But to the extent we think that rents will continue to moderate, and I think there is scope for them to do that, that’s one factor that should make us a little more comfortable.  Another factor is that there is a fairly broad-based slowing.  I won’t take a lot of time to go through the evidence, but particularly in the CPI there are some encouraging developments on the services side in terms of inflation to go along with the slowing in goods prices. Now, I am the first to acknowledge that lots of interpretations of the recent developments are possible.  We hope that favorable structural factors are at work.  One possibility certainly is that the wage increases are a catch-up for previous productivity gains and that we’re seeing a normal restoration of capital-income/labor-income relationships.  In that case, this may be in some sense a transitory adjustment that will restore those relationships and not necessarily contribute to inflation going forward.  Another possibility is that energy price effects are somewhat larger than we thought.  There seems to be some evidence that they are.  A third possibility is that what we saw earlier last year was, as Governor Kohn mentioned, a transitory upside, some of which has simply passed, and we are going back to the more fundamental rate of inflation.  So there are some structural reasons that inflation might be moderating. My having said that, we should certainly acknowledge the statistical noise that is inherent in these measures.  The monthly standard deviation of core inflation in 2006 was about 8 basis points.  If the true underlying inflation is 0.2 percent, then you have a very good chance of getting either 0.3 or 0.1.  Therefore, we and the financial markets ought to be braced for the possibility that we will get 0.3—I hope not worse—in the next few months.  I agree with the view that has been expressed that the trend has not yet been established, and we’ll have to follow its development.  Another very important point that has been raised—President Moskow, I think, was the first to raise it—is that, given the lags from economic activity to inflation that we see in standard impulse-response functions and so on, these improvements may be real but nevertheless temporary and the underlying labor market pressures and so on may lead to inflation problems a year or eighteen months from now.  I agree that it is a concern, and it goes back to my point earlier that we need to be very alert to changes in the pattern of aggregate demand going forward. As President Poole mentioned, one element that will help us is the endogeneity of financial conditions.  We haven’t done anything since the last meeting, but long-term real interest rates rose about 30 basis points.  The yield curve is still inverted by about 30 basis points.  So I think even the markets themselves have the ability to raise real rates quite significantly, enough certainly to make a difference in the mortgage market if the data continue to be strong and if inflation does not continue to subside.  Then we would have a bit more latitude as we try to determine whether the fourth quarter was a blip or a trend.  I think that’s still an open question. So let me just say that I broadly agree with what I heard.  The economy does look stronger.  That is an upside risk to which we need to be paying close attention.  Inflation looks a bit better, at least in the short term, but there are some long-term considerations that we need to keep in mind.  Finally, the basic contours of the outlook are not sharply changed, but I agree with the sentiment around the table that upside risk to inflation remains the predominant concern that the Committee should have.  Are there comments?  Yes, President Poole.,   We’ll start the meeting with the data.  Anything else? There’s a reception and dinner in Dining Room E.  It’s for those who wish to attend.  If you have other plans, please feel free to pursue them, and we’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00. [Meeting recessed] January 31, 2007—Morning Session,   Good morning, everyone.  Let’s start with asking Dave Stockton to report on this morning’s data.,   Thank you.  Are there any questions?  If not, Vincent."
"291";"MR. BARRON.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d focus a little more today in my comments on the State of Florida as it relates to the housing sector.  We’ve heard a lot more positive comments in just the past few minutes about housing.  So let me offer a contrarian view, if you will. Florida accounts for about 41 percent of our District employment and 6 percent of overall U.S. employment.  As for housing, Florida represented 8 percent of U.S. home sales in 2005 and 6 percent in 2006 as sales and construction continued to decline.  To put these numbers in perspective, single-family existing home sales in Florida have dropped 40 percent since January 2005 versus an 11 percent decline in the United States as a whole.  Anecdotal reports are that builders are continuing to work down existing inventory and are not starting new projects.  In most areas of the state, starts have fallen even more than sales, which should lessen the run-up in housing inventory over the immediate future.  Permit issuance for single-family homes is down 54 percent in Florida since January 2005 compared with 28 percent in the nation as a whole.  There are certain encouraging signs from reports noting, as mentioned earlier, that buyer traffic is better in some areas, and several of the building contacts that we spoke with expect or, perhaps I would note more accurately, are hopeful that new home sales will improve by the second quarter of 2007. Home prices have declined modestly but remain well above the levels implied by the pre- 2003 trends in most areas.  This places housing affordability at a relatively low level by historical standards.  As I noted at previous meetings, the demand in coastal markets is being constrained by the steep rise in homeownership insurance that has caused monthly housing costs to rise sharply, even as house prices moderate.  We’ve heard reports that in markets where prices accelerated the most in recent years, such as south Florida, employers are struggling to recruit staff because of the high housing costs, with some firms electing to leave south Florida and others beginning to convert corporate owned land to corporate housing just so that they can recruit employees.  As I reported at our last meeting, the decline in housing activity continues to have a negative effect on housing- related sectors specifically in the South because of our concentration in the carpet and other related industries.  Housing-related employment is no longer a net contributor to year-over-year employment growth in the United States, even though overall job growth has remained very firm. District banks reported that credit quality has softened but remains at very strong levels. However, banks are beginning to be a bit more vocal in expressing concern with regard to the possibility that builders will face financial problems in the coming months.  In addition, banks express concern about the number of speculative condominium projects in south Florida.  District banks have lower earnings targets for 2007, and the expectation is that bank merger and acquisition activity and layoffs will increase in the coming year.  Some banks are even putting out the “for sale” sign in the hope of cashing out now, noting that things could get ugly over the next two years in some areas. Outside the housing sector, indicators of economic performance in the District were mixed. Reports on holiday-related sales were on the positive side, whereas tourism remains relatively mixed across the District.  Reports from the manufacturing sector were also mixed, with a weakness in the housing-related industries offset to some extent by the expanding activity in industries related to defense and energy. For the U.S. economy as a whole, the drag from housing that we experienced over the second half of 2006 does not appear at this time to pose a serious threat to the overall economy, although some forecasters anticipate below-trend real GDP growth for the end of 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.  Most would say that this situation is temporary and would anticipate that real GDP growth will rebound and be close to the trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007.  Our staff projections of real GDP growth have had about the same tone as those of the external forecasters. Our staff believes real GDP growth will be sustained in 2007 by job creation that should match the experience that we’ve seen in 2006. Measured core inflation was well in excess of 2 percent at the end of 2006.  The staff forecast is that core inflation will continue to hover just above 2 percent for all of 2007.  The expectation is that price growth in services will continue to dominate core inflation going forward. In my comments I’ve focused a bit more on housing.  I would just close by noting that my continued concern would be the lack of impetus to drive down inflation over the long term.  Thank you."
"292";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Well, Mr. Chairman, first on our cheaper, more affordable, and perhaps luckier Eleventh District economy, we estimate that employment growth ran at a rate slightly greater than 3.2 percent last year and our output growth exceeded 4 percent.  We do see some possible slowing, but there is still very strong momentum in the Texas economy and to an extent in the New Mexican economy, despite a lower rig count. What I’m about to talk about is not based on the buoyancy of the Eleventh District economy but on my talking with CEOs as well as the economic projections of our own staff.  I’ve talked with twenty-five CEOs for today’s discussion.  I’ve added two, and just for the record they are the CEO of Disney and the CEO of MasterCard. First, my retail contacts, with one exception, report a pickup in dollar volume and foot traffic that began with the second half of December and has continued.  As a result, the Wal-Mart CEO for the United States is much more optimistic and is now forecasting volume expansion of about 2 to 3 percent.  My contact from JCPenney, which is in an income range that is double that of Wal-Mart, reports a similar pattern of behavior that started the Friday before Christmas and has carried forward and says that the consumers “feel good about the economy.”  The one exception, incidentally, is 7-Eleven, and I would be upset, too.  Tobacco constitutes 30 percent of their sales, and Texas just levied a $10 tax on a $30 carton of cigarettes.  Otherwise, the retailers seem to be much more optimistic than they were when I last reported.  A not unimportant factor in this report has to do with the phenomenon of gift cards.  In the public release of Safeway is an interesting piece of data:  Their gift card business, which is called Blackhawk, grew 100 percent last year and dropped $100 million to the pretax bottom line.  Wal-Mart reports—and this is not yet public information—a peak gift-card balance for this season of $1.2 billion.  Now, mind you, 70 percent of the card use occurs before February 1.  So this business has extended the retail season, and it may well have affected the buoyancy that I’m hearing from retailers in terms of their current activity. MasterCard confirms the pickup in consumer activity, particularly that it began late in the Christmas season, and its CEO reports from his contacts certainly much less “noise” about a possible recession and sees that risk abating.  Just to jump forward, we forecast, based on economic research, economic growth in our District of 2.7 percent for 2007, which is what MasterCard happens to be projecting—so I found that CEO to be instantly credible.  Disney reports extremely strong advertising growth.  They expect the year-over-year growth to be 20 percent in terms of their first- quarter network advertising, with strength in every sector except for autos, according to the CEO. They also report record foot traffic at their parks over the holidays.  In contrast, UPS reports a weak start to December but a strong finish in the last seven days of the year, with year-over-year numbers for January not as robust as expected—running around 1 percent.  The rails also report a bit slower volume, as the CEO of one of the large rail companies said.  There are clearly shifts taking place. For example, lumber shipments of Union Pacific and Burlington Northern are down 25 percent year over year, reflecting the falloff in the construction of homes.  Both CEOs caution that company year-over-year numbers are like comparing apples and oranges, given the robust growth in the first quarter of 2006.  I did talk to two of the top five housing CEOs and a third one, a smaller company. They seem to confirm the sense of the staff in that they feel that the housing situation is bottoming out, but they continue to caution that any reading of the housing industry between Thanksgiving and the Super Bowl is of questionable value.,   Yes.  But here are some data to put this statement in perspective.  The contact from the largest company reports that cancellation rates, which were running at 50 percent in their most stressed markets, particularly in California and Florida, have come back to 20 to 25 percent—relatively good news.  One aspect worth noting is that they are getting relief from their subcontractors—they estimate, on average across the industry, about 10 percent cost relief.  Another predictable behavior pattern becoming manifest is that the large contractors with very strong balance sheets are looking to buy the distressed smaller contractors.  David, I agree with you that we haven’t seen all the downturn in housing yet in terms of its effect on the economy, but we may well come out of it with an even more tightly consolidated industry.  The bottom line on growth from the Eleventh District perspective is a Wagnerian summation—that is, the economy’s growth dynamic is not as bad as we thought it was sounding when we last read the score.  I would summarize it by saying that the tail in terms of the risk of recession has become much slimmer. However, my conclusion is the opposite with regard to inflation—that is, on reflection and working with our staff and listening to CEOs, I think the tail in terms of risk of higher inflation has fattened, and this is reflected in several reports.  Just very quickly—because of my Australian DNA—Anheuser-Busch decided to raise beer prices 2 to 3 percent at year-end.  That doesn’t bother me.  What bothers me is the price of skilled workers who drink that good beer in terms of what’s happening for wages and total compensation of skilled and unskilled labor.  You know that I have talked about the massive projects that Texas Utility plans for coal to gas conversion and whether they get the so-called Dirty Dozen that they’re planning or just a handful.  I did go over with the CEO the studies that McKinsey, BCG, and Bechtel have provided for them, and some interesting data points came out that I want to summarize.  In the summer of ’05, they estimated that all-in labor costs for these plants, which they estimated per plant, would take 4.6 million worker hours at $36.25 an hour.  Today they don’t believe they can get the job done for less than $44 an hour; and because of worker quality issues, they now believe it will take 5.2 million worker hours for each plant.  So if you have a 21 percent per hour increase and a 13 percent increase in hours, one wonders about the ability to see a short-term reduction in skilled and unskilled labor costs.  These numbers, by the way, take into account the recent slippage in oil rig activity, which is down for the fifth straight week, and also the slowdown in housing and some initial slowdown in commercial construction.  It dovetails with reports like that of BP’s to us that they decided to pay all their salaried operators, to whom only two years ago they were offering incentive packages to leave, $25,000 bonuses per year for the next two years to stay.  Fluor’s CEO reports that they are having the largest year in their history of hiring college graduates, and the 900 mechanics who work for a large truck dealer with which I regularly talk are now fetching $35 an hour. Another piece of data comes from a study by McKinsey and BCG, and I want to talk about it very briefly in terms of the intermodal transportation system of our country.  The shippers tell me that port congestion is very high.  The fleet utilization rate is running at about 95 percent.  You know that I like to talk about Panamax ship rates because of their size and liquidity.  Prices have not eased since we last met, and the interesting factoid is that the ten-year-old fleet is available for purchase at the same price as the fleet expected to be delivered two and a half years from now. These ships run $39 million apiece before their add-ons, which tells you that there’s a short-term tightness.  If you talk to the rails and the effective two operators—there’s really a duopoly in this country between Burlington Northern and Union Pacific—their pricing is based on opportunity costs because they do not foresee the ability to expand their networks.  This may well facilitate an upward price spiral as all the infrastructure projects currently on the drawing boards begin, whether TXU’s or some other liquefied natural gas companies’ projects that we have heard about. A couple of other points with regard to inflation that I think bear watching:  These inputs are anecdotal, but I think we have a pretty good survey in terms of the oil and gas operators.  Most of the major oil and gas operators would not be surprised to see $40 oil and to see a range between $40 and $60 oil—that fits with the Brown-Yücel model that we developed in Dallas—and for natural gas prices to ease to a level of about $5 in the spring.  That’s the good news. I want to mention two other negative news items.  One was referred to earlier, and that regards corn prices.  The price for corn was $2.30 a bushel last year, if you looked on the graph that Bill, I think, presented earlier.  Corn is now running $4.00 a bushel, and the food production companies we talked to project the price to be $5.00 by the end of the year.  Now, this is good for farmers.  It’s good for John Deere.  It’s not good if you raise a chicken, a cow, or a pig, and it’s certainly not good if you’re a human who eats at Whataburger, one of my other new contacts.  I won’t use the language that the CEO used, but he reports that his margins are coming under pressure. The second development may be a bit more disturbing; it concerns the cost of imported goods from China into Wal-Mart’s network.  According to Wal-Mart’s CEO for international operations and their vice chairman, Chinese import prices into Wal-Mart’s network were depreciating at an annual rate of between 2 and 5 percent.  Recently, however, the rise in China’s labor costs for their suppliers net of the increase in productivity is leading to import price costs that are increasing at a rate of approximately 1 percent.  To me this development raises an issue that I think President Moskow touched on regarding our views on inflation and perhaps rates going forward, which we’ll talk about tomorrow.  At home, we’re seeing unacceptably high and sustained wage developments for certain critical components of labor, which I mentioned earlier.  Abroad from Germany to China, we’re seeing economic growth rates that are well above sustainable trends, which is why I asked the question about your gap analysis earlier.  My own staff calculates that, if you do a gap analysis—that is, if you compare current growth to what they estimate trend growth to be—there is no significant inflationary pressure.  However, if you analyze capacity utilization rates in the G7 countries and in the BRICs, we are getting closer, given the economic growth that has been experienced, to more heavily used capacity and to igniting inflationary pressures.   The bottom line for inflation from our perspective is that what was once a tailwind generated by globalization may be closer to becoming a headwind than our models indicate and our limited understanding of the effect of globalization otherwise leads us to understand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   It appears to be slowing in certain areas and in our District but is nonetheless running at a stout rate.  It seems to have come off somewhat but, given the large projects that are planned, the numbers work out to show increasing pressure on the labor that’s available to construct those projects."
"293";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, now that I have everyone’s attention, [laughter] I’m going to start with some information on the District and then talk briefly about the national economy from my perspective.  Let me begin by saying that the District’s activity did slow over the second half of 2006 in line with the national economy itself.  The slowdown was most apparent in housing and manufacturing.  However, the most recent data that we have from November and December indicate a pickup in some of the activity.  Moreover, reports from our directors and our business contacts suggest a considerable degree of optimism among them going forward, more than we expected actually.  One area in which we are seeing signs of improvement is housing itself. While new construction activity does remain subdued in our region, sales activity has picked up, and the inventory situation appears to be improving in our major markets.  Nonresidential construction remains strong and is offsetting some of the weakness on the residential side.  District employment growth has risen in recent months, and labor markets remain tight for us.  In addition to continuing shortages of skilled workers in a large number of technical and professional areas, we have recently received reports that the hospitality and recreational sectors are experiencing difficulty in finding lower-skilled workers as well.  We have also received numerous reports from directors in District businesses indicating higher year-end wage and salary increases. The situation in agriculture is somewhat mixed.  The sharp increases in crop prices, especially corn, driven by exports of ethanol and exports of corn itself, have caused the USDA to boost estimates of 2007 farm income rather significantly.  However, higher crop prices are also eroding profitability of livestock producers and processors in our region, which is a fairly important sector. One important sector in which activity appears likely to slow in 2007 is energy.  The District economy has benefited tremendously over the past few years from the rise in energy prices, which has spurred increased production of traditional products—and that includes oil, gas, and coal—as well as alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel.  According to reports from a couple of our directors, however, the recent decline in energy prices has already led to a reduction in drilling activity and is likely to cause some cutbacks in new investment in alternative fuels as well. Turning to the national outlook, I, like others, have noted the recent strength in the economy and have raised my estimates of growth for the fourth quarter and somewhat raised them for the first quarter.  I continue to expect growth to rise over 2007 modestly toward what I think is potential, in the neighborhood of 3 percent.  However, now I expect it to occur a little more quickly than I did at the December meeting.  Accordingly, recent economic information has led me to reassess the balance of risks to the outlook.  I believe the downside risks from the further slowing of housing have diminished somewhat.  Moreover, I share the view that the recent weakness in manufacturing activity reflects a better balancing of production and inventories rather than a fundamental weakness.  Going forward, the improved outlook for energy prices should support consumer spending by improving consumers’ disposable income, and we may see additional fiscal stimulus resulting from the more-favorable budget positions of the state and local governments. Finally, in terms of the inflation outlook, my views have not changed materially since the last meeting.  I’ve been encouraged by the recent inflation data, and I continue to expect inflation to decline over the forecast period.  I expect the core CPI to be in the 2.3 percent range and core PCE inflation to be about 2 percent for 2007.  However, as others have noted, core inflation is too high, and considerable uncertainty remains about whether the recent progress will be sustained. Particularly, it is not clear how the opposing trends of lower energy prices and greater resource pressures may play out over the next few quarters.  Consequently, it seems to me that there is upside risk to the inflation outlook.  Thank you."
"294";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In preparation for submitting my forecast, I looked at my previous forecasts—a humbling but instructive experience usually.  [Laughter] Going back a year, I found that, based on the staff’s estimate for 2006, inflation and growth had each turned out within a quarter point of my projections.  I’m quite certain that this is not a consequence of any particular expertise on my part.  Rather, it is indicative that, in a broad sense, the economy is performing remarkably close to our expectations.  President Poole was making this point.  Even going back a few years to when we started to remove accommodation, despite large fluctuations in energy prices in recent years, huge geopolitical uncertainties, and a housing boom and bust the dimensions of which we really didn’t anticipate three years ago, the economy is in the neighborhood of full employment, and core inflation is at a fairly low rate by historical standards. Now, the surprises last year were the surge of inflation in the spring and early summer. That has not been entirely reversed.  The extent of the slowdown in productivity growth, both in terms of trend and of actual relative to the lower estimated trend, and the related decline in the unemployment rate suggest that we are entering 2007 with a higher risk of inflation than I had anticipated a year ago.  Given this risk, it is especially important that economic growth be no greater and perhaps a little less than the growth rate of potential, and that is my forecast—a small uptrend in the unemployment rate.  The issue I wrestled with was how fast the economy will be growing when the drag from housing abates.  In early December, the debate might have been about whether demand would be sufficient to support growth as high as potential.  But given the stabilization of housing demand, the strength of consumption, and ongoing increases in employment, I asked myself whether we might not find the economy growing faster than its potential beginning in the second half of 2007 and in 2008, thereby adding to inflation pressures. A couple of forces, however, gave me a little comfort in supporting my projection of only moderate growth.  One is the modest restraint on demand from the recent rise in interest rates, especially the restraint on the housing market, and the dollar exchange rate.  Another is the likelihood that consumption will grow more slowly relative to income and will lag the response to housing as housing prices level out and as energy prices begin to edge higher.  Consumption late last year was probably still being boosted substantially by the past increases in housing wealth and by the declines in energy prices, which combined with warm weather to give a considerable lift to disposable income.  On the housing wealth factor, I think our model suggests that it takes several quarters for a leveling out in housing wealth to build into consumption.  In fact, the data through the third quarter suggest that prices were really just about leveling out in the third quarter.  So it may be a little early to conclude that, just because we’re not seeing a spillover from the housing market to consumption, there isn’t going to be any.  I expect some, though modest, spillover.  Moreover, some of the impulse in the fourth quarter was from net exports.  These were spurred in part by a temporary decline in petroleum imports and an unexpected strength in exports.  Those conditions are unlikely to be sustained.  In addition, business investment spending has been weaker than we anticipated.  Now, I suspect this is, like the inventory situation, just an aspect of adapting to a slower pace of growth, and investment will strengthen going forward.  But it does suggest that businesses are cautious.  They are not anticipating ebullient demand and a pressing need to expand facilities to meet increases in sales, and their sense of their market seems worth factoring into our calculations.  Finally, the fact that I would have been asking just the opposite question seven weeks ago suggests that we’re also putting a lot of weight on a few observations, [laughter] whether regarding the weakness then or the strength more recently. I do continue to believe that growth close to the growth rate of potential will be consistent with gradually ebbing inflation.  For this I would round up the usual suspects, reflecting the ebbing of some temporary factors that increased inflation in 2006.   One factor is energy prices. Empirical evidence since the early 1980s to the contrary notwithstanding, the coincidence that President Lacker remarked between the rise and fall in energy prices in 2006 and the rise and fall in core inflation suggests some cause and effect.  The increase in energy prices into the summer has probably not yet been completely reversed in twelve-month core inflation rates, so I expect some of that to be dying out as we go into the future.  Increases in rents are likely to moderate as units are shifted from ownership to rental markets.  The slowdown in growth relative to earlier last year seems to have made businesses more aware of competitive pressures, restraining pricing power.  When we met last spring, we had a lot of discussion about businesses feeling that they had pricing power—that they could pass through increases in costs.  I haven’t heard any of that discussion around the table today. The recent slowdown in inflation is encouraging but not definitive evidence that the moderation is in train.  The slowdown could have been helped by the decline in energy prices, and that decline won’t be repeated.  Goods prices might have been held back by efforts to run off inventories, and that phenomenon, too, would be temporary.  As I already noted, the initial conditions—the recent behavior of productivity and the relatively low level of the unemployment rate—suggest upward inflation risks relative to this gentle downward tilt.  To an extent, the staff has placed a relatively favorable interpretation on these developments.  They haven’t revised trend productivity down any further.  They expect a pickup in realized productivity growth over this year.  They see a portion of the strength in labor markets as simply lagging the slowdown in growth—a little more labor hoarding than usual as the economy cools, along with some statistical anomalies.  Thus, in the Greenbook, the unemployment rate rises, and inflation pressures remain contained as activity expands at close to the growth rate of potential. President Yellen at the last meeting and Bill Wascher today pointed out two less benign possibilities.  One is that demand really has been stronger, as indicated by the income-side data, and that the labor and product markets really are as tight as the unemployment rate suggests.  In this case, the unemployment rate wouldn’t drift higher with moderate growth.  Businesses might find themselves facing higher labor costs and being able to pass them on unless we take steps to firm financial conditions.  The second possibility is that trend productivity is lower.  In this case, actual productivity growth might not recover much this year.  Unit labor costs would rise more quickly.  Given the apparent momentum in demand, we might be looking at an even further decline in the unemployment rate in the near term.  Now, my outlook is predicated on something like the staff interpretation, but I think these other possibilities underline the inflation risks in an economy in which growth has been well maintained.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"295";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  Well, the data have come in so far according to plan, and you can thank Chairman Bernanke for doing that.  I think he has some special relations with the BEA and others.  [Laughter]  Exactly as we had hoped they would and said they would, the data show moderation in growth with a prospect for accelerating growth through 2007 and moderation in inflation—again, according to plan.  I think my views are similar to those that President Stern put forward:  The economy has shown an enormous amount of resilience. I want to talk about a few possible puzzles in the way the data have evolved and could perhaps deviate from plan as we go forward.  One puzzle is the great strength of the consumer. The consumer has been very, very strong for the past five years, and it seems that no matter what has happened—whether a housing downturn, an equity-market downturn, or a September 11— the consumer has come through rather strongly and continues to be strong.  We certainly have had a slowdown in the housing market, and maybe we’re waiting to see its effect on the consumer, as Don Kohn mentioned.  But it may just be that some special factors have come in; for example, we have had very strong international economic growth, and perhaps that will persist.  When you talk to officials and business people outside the United States, whether in emerging market economies, in the Gulf region, or in industrial economies, they are extremely optimistic, much more so than I have ever before seen, and that may continue.  Obviously, there is a risk factor here.  The recent strengthening in equity markets perhaps offsets some of the reduction in the asset values of homes.  Lower consumer energy prices, of course, have been an offsetting factor, and labor market strength and increases in compensation have been very important.  But there’s an upside risk that we will continue to have very, very strong consumption instead of having our error correction go back toward more saving. Second, with respect to investment, we have had orders above shipments for quite some time, but we have had investment actually declining, or at least not growing as we would expect. Overall in this recovery we have had weaker investment growth, and we have had very high profitability.  That raises another puzzle for me:  Why have we seen somewhat weak investment over the long run and especially more recently, given that most measures of consumer confidence and business confidence have been positive, equity markets seem to be positive, spreads seem to be low, and so forth.  Why are we not seeing more investment?  Investment may turn around in the next quarter or so, and then we’ll be out of the woods.  But I think the conditions that we predict will lead to an investment turnaround have been there for quite some time, and we haven’t seen the investment turnaround; and that is a puzzle to me. Third, with respect to inflation, obviously we are all pleased that the numbers have been coming out with greater moderation.  But I have a discomfort about exactly what is driving that moderation.  We have good short-term stories about how the slowdown in energy prices in the second and third quarters and some other temporary factors with respect to owners’ equivalent rent could be bringing down inflation.  But when we consider a longer period and try to look at the systematic data, we don’t see those kinds of relationships.  Are we just in some sort of regime shift?  Are those correlations not very good because we just haven’t had a lot of variation in the data over the past ten to twenty years, and so those forces are actually there, but we just find it very difficult to pull them out econometrically?  For me that is a puzzle, to be able to tell a short- term story with each of these pieces, but when I go to the staff and ask, “Well, what is the systematic evidence on it?” they say, “Well, it really isn’t there.”  That is a bit disturbing for me in trying to figure out where things are likely to go. Things have moved in a benign way.  I don’t think there’s a strong expectation that they would move in a nonbenign way.  But I don’t have a lot of confidence that I understand why they have moved as they have.  So my concern is that various shocks or other factors could come in to move them in a way that is not nearly so benign.  Broadly, however, I share the views that most people have expressed around the table that we have good growth prospects going forward and so far reasonable moderation of inflation.  But precisely because we have those good growth prospects and because we may have had some temporary factors that have kept down inflation, we have to be ever mindful of the upside risk to inflation."
"296";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in our District lost a bit of momentum in January.  Retail sales contracted in recent weeks as automobile dealers noted waning interest and buyers of big-ticket electronic goods stayed home, perhaps to watch the big screens they purchased during the holidays.  [Laughter]  Another source of slowing was a further pullback in the factory sector.  I should mention new orders in our District slipped in recent weeks, on top of December’s modest contraction, and factory hiring edged lower for the second straight month.  On the plus side, services firms continued to report moderate growth in revenues and employment. Despite this mixed picture, however, a wide variety of firms remained optimistic about their prospects six months out.  District labor market conditions remained tight, and skilled workers continued to be in strong demand in large metropolitan areas.  Businesses tell us that they are pushing up wages as a result. Real estate activity is, on balance, hanging in there.  Anecdotal reports indicate fairly firm home sales across many areas in December, and we’re hearing more reports of pockets of strength in some suburban housing markets around D.C., though assessments from other areas continue to be somewhat downbeat.  We have also heard that homebuilding activity rose somewhat in a number of District metropolitan areas in recent weeks.  Commercial real estate prospects remained relatively bright, with leasing activity firm and a solid number of projects on the books for ’07.  Price pressures at District firms seem to have moderated somewhat, confirming the national trends. The national data flow since our last meeting has been encouraging.  The Greenbook now predicts a higher trajectory for real GDP.  I agree with the Greenbook’s short-term outlook. Declining housing construction is still depressing the real growth rate now, but demand has stabilized, I think, and inventories may be topping out.  Each batch of housing data has bolstered my confidence in the trajectory we sketched out last fall—namely, that the drag from housing will mostly disappear by midyear with spillover having been relatively limited. Consumer spending has been quite resilient.  Evidently, favorable income prospects have trumped weakening housing prices.  The fundamentals for business investment remain favorable with the cost of capital low and profitability high; and the latest news—that unfilled orders for capital goods are continuing to increase—fits in well with the view that equipment investment is likely to be a source of strength going forward.  The Greenbook has real growth later this year and into next year returning to trend, driven by strength in business investment and solid consumer spending.  I agree with that outlook with the caveat that my estimate of trend growth is higher than the Greenbook’s. The inflation news since the last meeting has been encouraging as well.  Core CPI inflation was 1.8 in the fourth quarter, and core PCE inflation was estimated to have been 2.1 percent.  It’s tempting to extrapolate this favorable news forward as the Greenbook does and forecast a gradual downward drift without further overt action by the Committee.  That outcome is certainly plausible, especially if oil prices cooperate and remain contained within recent trading ranges.  But I remain apprehensive.  First, core inflation has exhibited fairly substantial high-frequency swings over the past couple of years.  So it will take many more months for me to be very confident that inflation is trending down.  Second, and related, over the past three years large swings in energy prices have been followed by swings in core inflation with a short lag.  Indeed, the cross-correlation between core and energy components of the PCE price index seems to have increased in the past few years. The recent dip in core inflation may therefore be the transitory effect of last summer’s decline in energy prices, and the December uptick in core CPI may signal that it’s behind us now.  A downward drift in inflation thus is likely to depend critically on the absence of upward movements in energy prices.  Note that the staff follows the futures market in assuming, as I calculated it, a 13 percent rise in oil prices by the end of 2008, which suggests continuing upward pressure on core inflation.  Third, expectations could well exert a gravitational pull in an upward direction rather than the downward direction as claimed recently in a popular newsletter and also as the staff indicated underlies their forecast.  Personally, I place the center of gravity a little higher, above 2 percent. The twelve-month change in core PCE inflation has been above 2 percent, as we all know, since March 2004, and none of the usual measures of expectations either from surveys or TIPS markets are much below 2½ percent for the CPI.  So even though the recent inflation news has been comforting, I think there’s a good reason to continue to worry about it.,   Mr. Chairman?,   Do you think that’s because they have changed their minds about our reaction function or about how the shocks are likely to come in between now and then?,   So what about our statement in October?  Did they miss that?,   I think he’s right.  He is suggesting that his belief is that the reaction function they hold to hasn’t changed much in the past month or two but that the shocks have come in more consistent with our assessment of how they were going to come in.  Is that fair?"
"297";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I’m last in this line, and I’ll try to be brief so that we can get to dinner soon.  I do see signs of stabilization in the housing market, and the way to think of it in terms of spillovers is that we do expect some spillovers through the natural effect of weaker housing on aggregate demand and on wealth.  But we’re not seeing anything out of the ordinary or a persistent pattern, and that gives me more confidence that nothing really bad is going to happen here.  My view is that the risks to the downside have decreased substantially.  Also, the tone of the recent data actually indicates that what is happening concerning aggregate demand is stronger than we would have expected.  As a result, I’m a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook in terms of what is going to happen next year with aggregate demand.  Actually, I see, if anything, a little more risk to the upside, so I slant a bit in that direction. The inflation numbers have been very good recently, and one view is that they are just temporary blips in the data.  I tend to be a little more sanguine here because I think that there are good reasons for inflation to gravitate toward what are solidly anchored inflation expectations. That has been very important in terms of the cycle and is one reason that I’m a little more optimistic than the Greenbook on inflation.  I do think that inflation expectations are strongly grounded around 2 percent on the PCE deflator.  As a result, I expect us to go to 2 percent inflation over the next year and then stay there but not go below there.  I don’t actually like to think of this in terms of “persistence.”  It is one reason that I’m unwilling to think that things will get better than that.  But I do think that we will likely have a more benign path of inflation than we might have thought earlier. Even if you think that there’s a more benign path to inflation, which I’m willing to consider though we’re not sure about it, it is still true that aggregate demand has blipped up recently.  That is an indication that the neutral real interest rate has moved up, which is very much reflected in the Greenbook assessment.  That’s important because, even if you’re happy about what’s happening with inflation, you have to be more worried about the fact that the economy is going to be stronger.  That does have some implications for the way we think about policy going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"298";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, some of my colleagues have told me they expected me to brag today because both teams in the Super Bowl are from the Seventh Federal Reserve District, but I assured them I would not do that.  [Laughter],    Some day we’ll have the Super Bowl at the Seventh Federal Reserve District.  But turning to the business at hand, business activity in our District continues to expand at a somewhat modest pace, but the tone of my business contacts was more positive than at our last meeting.  Manufacturing activity in the District is currently a bit soft.  The Chicago purchasing managers’ index fell from 51.6 in December to 48.8 in January, and this number will be released tomorrow morning. Many of my contacts are expecting a significant pickup in activity in the second half of the year.  We heard this from manufacturers of building materials, agricultural equipment, construction machinery, autos and steel, temporary-help firms, and even from several retailers.  Though a number of manufacturers thought that the recent softness was temporary and reflected the need to work off some modest inventory buildups, they said the final demand for their products remains solid.  The steel industry is a good example of this kind of dynamic.  Industry production has fallen sharply since the summer; but when I recently talked to the head of a major steel company, he noted that demand from end users had remained quite stable, and he expected it to stay that way.  The production cutbacks were mainly the result of inventory fluctuations at the service centers, which buy bulk quantities of steel to process and distribute to final customers.  The analysts in the industry are divided on when this inventory correction will be complete, but even the pessimists think that it will be done by late spring.  With the steady demand from end-use customers, my contact thought that production and prices would definitely be rising by the second half of the year.  There was an article in the paper today that mentioned that Nucor is trying to raise prices by $20 a ton in March. My auto contacts had mixed views about 2007.  Last year was especially tough for the Big Three. High gas prices shifted sales from SUVs to cars, and then the mix of sales shifted from retail toward fleet sales, where their margins are lower.  GM thought that gas prices probably have fallen enough to stabilize the market share of light trucks and that retail sales were now down near their long-term trend levels.  Ford was not as sanguine about either of these developments.  Finally, the strength of foreign demand and the weaker dollar seem to be showing through to increased export demand for a number of our District’s manufacturers, and this situation supports the comments in the chart show. The national economy is clearly showing more underlying strength than we thought in December.  Moreover, the downside-risk scenarios now seem less likely.  The housing markets look to be nearing the bottom, and the spillover to other sectors now seems likely to be minor or is being offset by other positive factors.  Importantly, tight labor markets and lower energy prices are boosting consumer spending.  We continue to expect that growth will be modestly below potential in the first half of the year, but like my business contacts, we expect activity to pick up in the second half and growth to be a touch above potential by 2008.  Unlike the Greenbook, this projection is conditioned on market expectations for interest rates, which impart some degree of accommodation next year.  So currently I see the risks to the growth forecast as being fairly well balanced.  On the downside, we could be wrong about the stabilization in housing, and on the upside, consumer spending could remain robust or demand from abroad could accelerate. Overall, the recent data on inflation have been positive.  As a result, the forecasts from our inflation models are lower by a tenth or two.  The models estimated using data only since 1984 predict that core PCE inflation will be flat at 2.3 percent through 2008.  So I’m less optimistic about inflation than the Greenbook.  In my mind, there are two key questions concerning the inflation outlook.  First, what happens in 2009 and beyond?  As we were discussing before, in chart 6 in the Bluebook, for whatever reason, inflation is moving up, and I think that’s a concern.  Second, there’s the issue of longer-run inflation expectations.  In the Greenbook forecast, by the end of ’07, inflation would have been at or above 2¼ percent for a year and a half with no change in the fed funds rate and a reasonably strong economic environment.  I think markets might interpret this inaction as a signal that we’re satisfied with 2¼ percent inflation, not the 1 percent to 2 percent comfort zone that many of us have said we prefer.  This view was shared by the participants at our recent gathering of academic and business economists—we have an advisory committee that meets a few times a year. Indeed, several academics thought we were already at this point.  In their minds, the current policy stance and inflation picture revealed that we were satisfied with inflation stabilizing at or a bit above 2 percent.  The business economists also were predicting that we would find ourselves in the position of needing to increase rates some time this year in order to put inflation on a pronounced downward path.,   The one with two teams from the Seventh District. [Laughter]"
"299";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Third District have continued to evolve much as they have for most of the past several months.  Economic activity is still expanding.  I think I can use the word “moderate”—I don’t think anybody else has used that yet, and our contacts expect the pace to be maintained in the coming months.  There has been little change in the pattern of activity over the sectors.  Retailers in our region indicated that their holiday sales were about as they expected or somewhat better.  Housing continues to weaken at a somewhat orderly pace, but there are signs of stabilization of demand.  Inventory has remained elevated, and construction continues to decline.  However, the weakness in residential construction is being offset by continued strength in nonresidential construction.  Office vacancy rates continue to decline in Philadelphia and in the near suburbs as well.  The net absorption of office space has increased for the past twelve quarters.  Manufacturing activity in the region hit a soft spot in the fall, as I indicated in previous meetings, but our most recent Business Outlook Survey, in January, presented somewhat positive but also somewhat mixed signals.  The general activity index returned to positive territory with a reading of plus 8, indicating a slight increase in manufacturing activity, and there was a significant rebound in shipments.  New orders, however, remained close to zero.  That’s somewhat of an aberration because new orders and shipments tend to move very much together, and so there are some inconsistencies there, which is why I said the situation is a bit mixed.  According to our survey, however, the firms expect a rebound of general manufacturing activity and orders over the coming six months.  Indeed, most of our business contacts see moderate growth in the region continuing for the foreseeable future.  Their positive attitudes are consistent with the recent positive news we’ve had about conditions in the nation.  Firms remain concerned about their ability to hire both skilled and unskilled labor.  Labor markets are tight for many of the reasons that President Minehan described in New England; we have some of the same things going on in the Third District. Regarding national conditions, the unusually warm weather in December may have temporarily buoyed some of our numbers; but based on incoming information, I’ve become increasingly confident that the national economy has a positive underlying momentum.  At the time of our last meeting, there was a contrast between the mixed data on consumption and production and the relatively strong indications from the labor market.  The picture that appears to be emerging from the latest economic information is one of stronger underlying growth that has been temporarily weakened by housing and autos.  There is little, if any, evidence that the housing and auto corrections are spilling over into the other sectors of the economy.  We’ve been looking for those spillovers for the past six months and have yet to see any significant evidence that they are occurring or are about to occur.  Of course, spillovers may yet materialize with a long lag, but that likelihood to my mind is diminishing as we have begun to see some hopeful signs of stabilization in housing.  Labor market conditions remain firm, and manufacturing indicators improved in December as did capital goods orders.  Although I didn’t talk to the chairman of Disney, I did talk to a small manufacturing firm with total revenues that come to $2 million.  He has been very positive about the outlook.  His sales depend a lot on construction, and he said that, after the most miserable August and September he had ever seen in his twenty years of running the business, the pickup began in late November, continued through December, and has continued into January as well.  Other contacts from banks, particularly credit card issuers to whom I’ve talked, suggest that banks are seeing numbers coming across their books on credit card purchases continuing to be strong even after Christmas.  So that also is good news. All of this suggests that the downside risks to growth have receded since our last meeting.  I believe this is the market’s assessment as well, as expectations of future policy firm.  My outlook is that the economy will return to trend growth, which I put at about 3 percent this year, and will continue at that pace into 2008.  Of course, as everybody has indicated, that’s a little stronger than the Greenbook’s outlook, and it is, again, based on my view that potential growth or trend growth is somewhat higher than the Greenbook has stated.  I expect the unemployment rate to rise slightly, maybe to 4.8 percent by the fourth quarter of this year, and then to stabilize into next year.  I think this is going to be accompanied by employment growth of nearly 1 percent, and again, that’s what accounts for the difference in the trend growth. I anticipate a decline in core PCE inflation of about 0.4 percent by 2008.  I would like to underscore that this forecast is not driven by a lower pass-through of oil prices, which have declined.  My reading of the empirical evidence, including work done by some people on the Philadelphia staff, is that it’s very difficult to attribute movements in core inflation of six months to twelve months or longer periods to changes in oil prices.  In fact, there’s growing empirical evidence that neither movements in oil prices nor Phillips curve type factors significantly improve our root mean square error forecasts of core inflation two or more quarters ahead.  I note that this refers to forecasts of six months or longer and not to short-run high-frequency movements.  This suggests that we should be careful in the language we use describing the reasons for our projections of future inflation to avoid perpetuating views of inflation processes that we can’t empirically substantiate. In my view, core inflation will not come back down until monetary conditions, which I believe have been very accommodative over the past few years, have tightened sufficiently.  The Greenbook forecast has a slightly smaller decline in core PCE inflation to about 2 percent in 2008, but incorporates a less restrictive monetary policy than I believe is likely to be appropriate given my view of the strength of the underlying economy and of the fundamentals that we are seeing.  Indeed, over the past two meetings, my feeling was that the slowdown in economic activity that we might be seeing, combined with a constant fed funds rate, might have been enough to bring inflation back to a more acceptable level.  Now I’m less convinced that price stability will be achieved without further action on our part some time later this year.  But I will leave that discussion to the policy go- round.  Thank you.,   That’s right, somewhat tighter, somewhat more aggressive than what’s in the Greenbook.,   The path I was thinking about as I was doing the forecast and trying to determine the appropriate policy here—my desire is to get inflation down lower, and that’s reflected in my forecast—is one in which the fed funds rate goes up somewhat from where it is today, perhaps to 5½ or 5¾ percent.  But then by the end of ’07 and into ’08, it’s coming back down again to more of a steady-state level, and then we can talk about what the real neutral rate is.,   Well, there’s some uncertainty about that.  I think it would get to between 1.5 and 2 percent."
"300";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have to start by saying that it’s hard to compete with my colleague Richard Fisher, with his stable of contacts.  I have perhaps just a slight amendment on Wal-Mart.  My contact there said that he has observed in recent years a changing pattern of holiday shopping, with shoppers procrastinating and putting their shopping closer to Christmas, and that might have moved some sales from November to December; also the growth of the gift card business moved some of those sales into January.  Those circumstances might explain a bit of what we’re seeing.  He said that it looks as though the January same-store sales growth will come in at 2½ to 2¾ percent.  I’m sure that’s consistent with Richard’s information.  My contact points out that, although those numbers are a little better than what they had anticipated a month or two ago, they are still 200 basis points below the original plan, which was set about a year ago.  For February their plan is 4½ percent, but he believes that anything north of 3 would be good performance.  His view is that he doesn’t see a lot of momentum one way or another, that things are pretty steady, and that there’s been no particularly significant change in the situation. My FedEx contact sees business as very steady.  There was a very strong peak season, pretty much on projection.  The one negative he sees is in the less-than-truckload business, and that confirms information coming directly from a trucking industry source as well.  Basically, the outlook is good, steady, and very confident.  As for capital expenditures, FedEx is expecting to have 15 percent above this fiscal year in the next fiscal year, which starts June 1.  My contact does not see any particular labor market pressures.  My UPS contact said that the company is cutting its cap-ex, and they are actually cutting capacity.  He said that they are cutting out twelve flights, I think it was, that they had just added in June.  The cuts are basically a consequence of a careful analysis of their express business, which showed that a lot of it is just unprofitable, particularly the shipping of packages to individual homes.  They are renegotiating contracts with online retailers and mail order retailers, and they’re trying to shed some of that business. My trucking industry contact says that things just don’t look very sound.  Freight volume, which would be full truckloads, is actually off 4 percent year over year in January.  Shipping rates are flat, but there are intense pressures from their clients to cut rates.  Driver turnover is up because the drivers are not getting enough business to eat well, and so they are shopping around for other companies.  So they are losing some drivers, but they’re not too worried because they have plenty of drivers at the moment.  The intermodal business is holding up well, my contact said. I’d like to just make one brief comment on the national outlook.  I think it’s pretty clear, and it’s reflected around the table, that the outlook for real GDP is a bit stronger than it was at our December meeting, and depending on your perspective in reading the data, maybe the inflation picture is a bit better, too.  But I would emphasize that, compared with past revisions of the outlook, these are really marginal and not material revisions.  There hasn’t been any really big news here.  We don’t want to get carried away with a flow of data that is only slightly stronger. Let me also comment, along the same lines, about what has been going on with longer- term interest rates.  At the time of our December meeting, the constant-maturity ten-year rate was 4.49.  At least that’s what I have in my spreadsheet.  On Friday, it was 4.88.  There has been a lot of comment to that effect.  I think that change is due partly to the string of marginally stronger news and partly to a change in the market’s assessment about our likely future behavior. The market has simply taken out the expectation of a rate cut in the near term.  The market has looked again at where we are to a much greater extent than we ourselves have.  Thank you.,   I suspect that it’s a combination.  But I also think that a number of us in our speeches have been saying things such as that we think policy is at about the right place.  If we repeat that often enough, the markets begin to think that we’re not about to cut rates.,   I guess that it’s a consequence of the interaction between what we’ve been saying and the flow of data.  You have to be careful about double-counting here, but the flow of data has perhaps convinced the market that what we were saying is right because the market, I think, had developed a somewhat different sense of where the economy was going than they had thought that we held.,   Yes.,   We have two important pieces of information coming in at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  I hope the staff can give us a quick first read to start our meeting.  I know that instant analysis is risky, but I ask for it anyway.  [Laughter]"
"301";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Trends evident in the District economy for some time fundamentally are continuing.  Specifically, employment is increasing moderately and steadily. Most components of aggregate demand are expanding, and I would note, in particular, strength in nonresidential construction.  There has been no significant acceleration of inflationary pressures or of wage pressures.  The housing sector is subdued, but the District data on sales and starts suggest stabilization, as do the national data.  The data on the inventory of unsold homes perhaps are contradictory to that statement because there are still a lot of unsold properties; at least those data suggest that it will be some time before there is any pickup in housing activity.  In any event, as Bill Dudley mentioned, mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are rising, albeit starting from a fairly low level, and though that probably won’t have a significant effect on economic performance, it could be a political issue in Minnesota and elsewhere in the District. As far as the national economy is concerned, it seems to me that the incoming data over the past several months underscore a couple of things.  First, the data demonstrate, again, the underlying resilience of the economy.  Second, they bolster the case for sustained growth over the next year or more, accompanied by steady to diminishing core inflation.  Let me elaborate briefly on those observations.  The economy apparently grew better than 3 percent in real terms again last year, despite the significant run-up in energy prices, the appreciable decline in housing activity, and problems in the domestic auto industry.  As I think about the prospects for ’07, I see little in the broad scheme of things to suggest that overall real growth over the next year will be much different from that over the past year or, for that matter, much different from that experience from ’03 through ’05.  It also seems to me that our earlier concerns about the possibility of a further acceleration of core inflation have diminished, largely on the basis of the incoming information on inflation, thereby through the process of elimination heightening the outlook for steady to declining core inflation.  I actually think that case is pretty good, partly because some of the factors that boosted core inflation were transitory and partly because inflation expectations, as best I can judge, have remained well anchored.  That’s the message I get, at least from financial markets, from labor markets, and from conversations with our directors, other business people, and so forth.  So for me, overall the near-term to medium-term outlook both for real growth and for inflation is constructive. I’ll stop there."
"302";"MR. STOCKTON.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  And I will provide it.  [Laughter].  Whether it’s worth anything or not, I don’t know.  [Laughter],   So, Mr. Chairman, this was sort of done on the fly.  Unlike the BEA, I won’t be able to go back and revise these remarks.  [Laughter]  Total GDP this morning came in at 3½ percent.  That was 0.9 percentage point stronger than we had forecast in the Greenbook. There were really two sources of our miss in the fourth quarter.  Of that miss, 0.5 was the net export component, which Karen will speak about in a second, and 0.4 was nonfarm inventory investment.  So perhaps Karen will give the quick story on the net export side, and then I’ll complete the report.,   That’s basically half of our GDP miss.  The other half is on the inventory investment side.  Just like with Karen, about half of our miss on inventory investment has to do with a difference of opinion about what the December book value figures will turn out to be.  So it’s just a difference between the BEA’s estimate for December and our estimate for December.  I don’t think we’d be inclined to alter our December estimate, so we’d write off roughly half of that miss on nonfarm inventory investment.  We don’t do that great a job of forecasting those book value inventory figures either.  It is not as though we have lots of information or a good reason for staking ourselves to our forecast versus the BEA’s, but I don’t think they have any more information than we do.  As for private domestic final purchases, which we have been emphasizing, even given some of the recent noise in net exports and government, there we were, in fact, almost exactly right; we were off by 4 basis points in terms of its contribution to overall GDP.  In terms of the composition, consumption was a bit weaker, and equipment spending a bit stronger, probably because of BEA’s estimate of the share of autos being sold to businesses versus households.  So we don’t really see very much information there. On net, government was a bit weaker:  The federal side was weaker by more than the state and local side was stronger.,   I actually don’t know what the domestic final purchases were, but if you include the government, which they do, they were a little weaker than the number we had written down.,   Yes, I don’t know what the overall number is; I know only what the contributions are.  We’ll be able to get the overall number by break time.  Taking on board our differences of opinion about the December figures, we’d probably be writing down, with the release in hand today, a GDP estimate for the fourth quarter of about 3 percent rather than the 3½ percent that is being currently published—and in contrast to the 2½ percent we wrote down in the Greenbook. So then the question is, What does this imply about the overall momentum of activity going into the first quarter?  My answer has to be “not much,” and I don’t think this is just blind stubbornness, although I’m glad my wife is not here to dispute that particular characterization. [Laughter]  But about the two surprises—as Karen already indicated, they would be inclined to actually mark down their contribution of net exports to GDP growth in the first quarter on the basis of the net export side.  We would probably be inclined to do the same thing with respect to the higher inventory investment, and so we’re coming into the first quarter with somewhat higher inventory-sales ratios and maybe some indications that we’re not as far along in working down inventories as we had thought.  I’m glad that I don’t actually have to write down that first-quarter number today because we will have an employment report on Friday and some first real readings on the pace of activity in the first quarter by the end of the week and in the next week or two.  So basically I’d argue that there isn’t a lot of signal in that 3½ percent figure that we’re moving into the first quarter with much thrust.  Another reason for not necessarily marking up activity as we move into the first half of this year, even though GDP came in 1 percentage point above our estimates, is that real disposable income actually came in 1 percentage point weaker than our Greenbook estimate.  So it isn’t as though, with the higher growth rate of activity, we have more underlying growth in labor income that is likely to be spent going forward.  We have an even lower saving rate now in the fourth quarter than we have written down.  Thus I think there are several reasons for not necessarily reading this as a sign of greater strength moving into the first part of the year. On the inflation side, things were actually spot on.  Total PCE inflation was minus 0.8 percent.  That’s what we had written down in the Greenbook.  Core PCE was 2.1—also exactly what we had written down in the Greenbook.  Market-based core was 1.7; that was actually 0.1 percentage point better than what we had written down in the Greenbook.  The other major release this morning was the employment cost index, which showed a year-over-year increase of 3.2 percent.  That number also is exactly what we had written down in the Greenbook, so I don’t think we really see any difference.  Obviously, the number has continued to be very subdued.  So in the totality, on the inflation side, things are looking very close to our expectations and I think still pretty good.  Mr. Chairman, that’s all I have to say."
"303";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d provide just a couple of perspectives, first on the 2006 economy and then, by extrapolation, on the trends in ’07.  With respect to 2006, I think the economy outperformed market expectations and Greenbook expectations, for probably at least four reasons.  The first is the underlying strength of the employment market, which has been much discussed today.  Second, the strength and durability of household finance, which, as Vice Chairman Geithner said, turned out to be far more determined by W-2 income than some of the household balance sheet items like home equity and stock market effects.  But we need to take another look at that trend in 2007.  Third, the economic outperformance in ’06 had much to do with the resilience of the U.S. capital markets as evidenced in credit spreads and other financial instruments, particularly in the face of some rather seismic events—one-time, potentially systemic events like the Amaranth Advisors collapse; cyclical price spikes with respect to commodity prices that may well have been somewhat demand-driven; a series of supply shocks driven by oil; and a seeming transition to slower growth in the middle of the year.  Fourth were the continued powerful sources of liquidity that smoothed the transition over the several bumps in the road. I also looked at what the most reliable and the least reliable indicators of the state of the economy in ’06 were to see whether those signposts might hold for ’07.  I think the tax receipt information that we saw in ’06 was telling us that incomes were likely ahead of trend—tax receipts for ’06 were up a total of 11.6 percent.  Corporate profits, which were up 92 percent in the past four years, had another remarkable year, up in the mid-teens.  Stock prices, obviously closely related to corporate profits, were up 84 percent in the past four years and up about 15 percent in 2006.  Credit spreads continued to trend tighter; high-yield spreads were down about 100 basis points from September.  Another couple of reasonably reliable indicators for ’06 were the household survey of employment, which suggested early and often that employment growth was likely to be ahead of expectations, and merger and acquisition pipelines, which suggested a degree of confidence in the markets by business leaders and other folks involved in finance. A less reliable indicator for 2006 growth was the shape of the yield curve, and the suggestion from most of us around the table to the markets was that the yield curve wasn’t predicting much by way of recession in the short term.  Another less reliable indicator was the consumer confidence and business confidence surveys, which seemed to snap all over the place, perhaps more because of geopolitical events and some short-term data than any really driving profile.  With respect to inflation, it is hard to find any indicators that were very good at telling us its path, but I do think that the TIPS spread, even when there was much talk in the spring and the summer about rising inflation, seemed to stay relatively well anchored and not to move too much based on some of that noise in the data.  So that indicator seems to have been reasonably good.  As was mentioned earlier, monthly CPI and PCE core measures seemed to be moving around rather significantly, so it was hard for us to determine too much from them as 2006 went forward. Taking all of that into account, as I think about 2007, I find that analyzing those indicators is not without significant peril, but let me attempt doing so.  The trends appeared supportive of strong, balanced economic growth for 2007, and although inflation expectations are well anchored and recent high-frequency data appear promising, I remain much more concerned about inflation prospects than about growth.  Having said that, I do think that as an institution we go into 2007 with probably even heightened credibility on the inflation front and in terms of our perspectives on the economy, which should help us over the next twelve months. Two key themes summarize my views on 2007.  First, strong employment trends should continue to support consumer spending.  Second, strong corporate balance sheets and balanced global growth should support capital expenditures.  Now, of those two themes, I would note that I have considerably more confidence in the former than in the latter.  I’ll spend another moment on that shortly.  The tone of the markets appears to be exceptionally strong.  Spreads have tightened, even as yields have trended back to 5 percent.  Over November and December, we had three weeks, each with more than $11 billion being priced in the high-yield market.  Just to give some perspective on that fact, for the year 2000 there was a total of $50 billion in the high-yield market.  But what has happened in the past six weeks that might be able to inform our judgments?  Double B spreads have tightened about 25 basis points, single Bs have tightened 50 basis points, and triple C spreads have tightened 70 basis points in the past six weeks, all of which continues to signal to me that the economy maintains a relative strength and that investors feel confident about the bets that they’re making.  In summary, I would say there are significant tails on both sides of this rather strong base case for the economy, but the economy is more likely to track above the expectations of the Greenbook. Let me spend a couple of moments on the consumer.  Contacts from two large credit card companies to whom I spoke last week expect and have seen in January the same kind of strength that they saw in December.  The first three weeks of January look to be a continuation of the late but positive trend in the fourth quarter.  For what it’s worth, the contacts’ own projections are that the first quarter will be rather strong, much like the fourth quarter ended up being.  Today, we’ve all tried to wrestle with what the Greenbook referred to as the “unexplained strength” of household spending during 2006 to determine its effect on ’07.  Let me spend a couple of moments on a hypothesis that the contacts proffered regarding that strength, which the Greenbook references in its “buoyant consumer” simulation. What that strength may well prove is that employees worked more, earned more, and had more savings from their household balance sheets to fund consumption than the data to this point are suggesting.  I think that could turn out to be the case in 2007.  First, people worked more. The benchmark payroll survey on total job creation may well be revised upward again significantly, like the revision of last year.  Gains in service jobs may well be less counted than some of the losses in other kinds of jobs—another bias for upward revisions.  The JOLTS data to which President Pianalto referred continue to be very positive, suggesting a real dynamism in the economy that may well be accelerating.  Participation rates may continue their recent spike as new workers selectively choose to enter this marketplace.  Average hours worked moved up in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 2.2 percent, and that trend could continue.  So monthly employment gains have not proved much harder to achieve as we approach what we thought was full employment, and the NAIRU may be lower than estimated.  Second, people certainly may well have earned more.  Average hourly earnings were up 4.2 percent for ’06, an acceleration that was rather widespread from ’05 measures.  Though the data on compensation continue to be mixed, they do seem to be trending in that direction.  The divergence between profits and compensation suggests to me at least that there is large upside potential for unemployment to stay low and for wages to accelerate, perhaps in a catch-up for wage gains that we didn’t see earlier in the cycle.  Third, as a result of working more and earning more, I suspect that workers may continue to spend more, particularly with the gift of what seems to be relatively low oil prices, in the mid-fifties.  The oil price seems to me to have less of a risk premium and now appears to reflect some elevated supply and at least modestly lower demand.  In sum, with respect to the consumer side, I am reasonably well confident. I’ll spend just a moment on the business side of the equation.  Fourth-quarter profits appear to be quite good, with two-thirds of companies beating estimates.  As many of these companies are challenged to have double-digit earnings in 2007, they may look for other avenues in which to buy those earnings—in the M&A world—or increase cash outlays through share repurchases from their excess cash on the balance sheet to maintain earnings per share growth in the double digits.  Another alternative is that they might choose to increase cap-ex as many of us, including myself, would have expected them to do earlier in this cycle.  Doing so could have a negative effect on short-term earnings but would show some real confidence in their long-term investment and growth plans.  As already mentioned, shipments and orders fell in the fourth quarter, and our working explanation is that much of that fall is really an inventory adjustment. We’ve had that discussion for a while.  I would expect business investment and industrial production to pick up.  If it doesn’t do so in the first quarter, my confidence about this side of the economy, about this leg of the stool, will be significantly reduced.  Between now and the next time we meet, we will have a better sense of whether that turn on the business side of the economy is real or whether we just saw a false start in December.  So I think we’ll be able to come to a much firmer view when we meet in six weeks.  All in all, I remain reasonably confident and optimistic about the forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"304";"MS. BIES.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like several of you, I’m going to focus on housing and what we’re seeing in the banking sector and in mortgage performance.  Since the last meeting, I am feeling better about the housing market in the aggregate.  It looks as though home sales are stabilizing for the fourth quarter.  On the whole, home sales actually did go up a bit.  The inventory of new homes for sale has now fallen for five months through December, and mortgage applications for home purchases continue to move above the levels of last summer, when they hit bottom.  The National Association of Realtors is estimating that existing home sales have already bottomed out, and homebuilder sentiment improved in three of the four past months.  But even if sales really have stabilized, the inventory of homes for sale still must be worked down before construction and growth resume in this market.  Given that some existing homes have likely been pulled off the market in light of slower sales and moderating housing prices, this inventory correction period will probably continue into 2008.  I think this is particularly true in markets such as Florida, as First Vice President Barron mentioned, where a large amount of speculative investment occurred during the boom period—with three to five years of excess construction from the investor side.  So those homes still have to be worked through. Asset quality in the consumer sector as a whole is very good.  We have come through one of the most benign periods.  The exception, as Bill mentioned in his presentation earlier today, is the subprime market.  When you dissect it, you see that prime mortgage delinquencies are flat and subprime mortgages at a fixed rate are flat.  The whole problem is in subprime ARMs, which are running into difficulties.  The four federal regulatory agencies are looking harder at some of these subprime products.  We started reviewing 2/28 mortgages, and now we’re looking at and testing some other products.  We’re finding that the issues are getting more troublesome the further we dig into these products.  To put the situation in perspective, subprime ARMs are a very small part of the whole mortgage market.  As Vincent mentioned, subprime is about 13 percent, and the ARM piece of the subprime is about half to two-thirds, so we’re talking perhaps around 8 percent of the aggregate mortgages outstanding.  We’re seeing that the borrowers who got into these during the teaser periods now are seeing tremendous payment shocks.  For example, 2/28s that are going from the fixed two-year period to the adjustment period basically had their interest rates double, so they’re going from a 5 percent handle to a 10 percent handle, and the borrowers don’t have the discretionary income to absorb that.  This type of mortgage was sold to a lot of subprime borrowers on the idea that they are lending vehicles to repair credit scores.  You will show that you are going to pay during the early period, and then you can refinance and get a lower long-term rate, so you’ll never pay the jump.  But we’re finding that some of these mortgages have significant prepayment penalties, and so to refinance and get the better terms, some borrowers are getting into difficulty.  Because of the moderation in housing prices, these borrowers haven’t built up enough equity to absorb the prepayment penalty.  So the problem stems from a combination of factors.  There are a lot of spins on these products, but we’re trying to take an approach based on principles in looking at what’s really happening. I also want to mention that, although the ownership of the mortgages is very diffuse and so we’re not seeing any real concentrated risk, particularly in banking, we do need to pay more attention to where the mortgage-servicing exposures are.  The servicing of these mortgages that are securitized is concentrated in certain institutions.  Clearly, when you have such a high level of delinquencies and potential defaults, all profitability in servicing is gone.  So there could be some charge-offs in these securitized mortgages.  Also, I think all of you have noticed the number of mortgage brokers that have closed up shop in the past six months because they couldn’t get enough liquidity or capital to repurchase the early defaults of these recent pools. That is really shrinking the origination pocket.  I should also say that, with the exception of the subprime ARM mortgages, we feel very good about overall credit quality. When I look at the economy as a whole, I also see that except for housing construction and autos, the rest of the economy is sound.  The recent growth in employment and the strong wage growth give me comfort that the income growth of consumers is there to mitigate some of the wealth effects that we may have with moderating housing prices.  But I also share the concerns that some of you mentioned here, and that President Yellen spoke of in a speech, about the issue regarding productivity trends and wage growth, and determining how fast the economy is growing.  Productivity is going to have to grow faster to absorb the higher wage growth, particularly as employment growth continues strong, and I think the slack in the skilled labor force is getting very, very limited. When I think, in aggregate, about the data since our last meeting, I feel a little better about inflation because it appears to be moderating, but I’m not jumping for joy because we need a few more months.  However, the growth information has been, instead of mixed as at the last meeting, generally stronger, and that does make me feel better.  In net, then, based on the recent information, I’m even a bit further along on the side that the risks have moved higher for inflation than on the side of the risk of a slowdown in the economy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"305";"MS. JOHNSON.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  The net export numbers are based on trade data only for October- November, and we each make an estimate of what December is going to be.  Perhaps half of our miss, or not quite half, was due to differences of opinion about December.  Looking at what they’ve done for December, we will take some information from that.  Some of what they’ve put in December is information that we didn’t otherwise have.  To some degree, it’s statistical and not really about trade.  It’s something called a territorial adjustment.  Maybe a quarter is differences about things in December for which we are not prepared to change our minds at this point.  So we would not go to as strong a positive contribution from net exports as they go because we retain some difference of views about what the December numbers will turn out to be.  The other bit of news we received was very strong exports of services.  We’ll take that, and we’ll probably give most of the adjustment, but not quite all of it, in the number we write down next for Q4.  We will actually want to reverse that thing called territorial adjustment in Q1.  So we’re actually going to make imports stronger and the net export contribution slightly more negative in Q1 as a result."
"306";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  The New England regional economy continues to grow at a moderate pace with relatively slow job growth, low unemployment, and moderating measured price trends.  Consumer and business confidence is solid, and while retail contacts reported an uneven holiday season, manufacturers were generally upbeat about business prospects.  Skilled labor continues to be in short supply and expensive.  In every one of the New England states, there is concern over the long-run prospects for labor force growth, given their mutual low rates of natural increase, out-migration of 25 to 34 year olds, and dependence on immigration for labor force growth.  New England is an expensive place in which to live, and concerns abound about how to attract and retain the highly skilled workers that are needed for its high preponderance of high value added industries.  Obviously, there’s nothing new or particularly cyclical about the foregoing comments.  But I’ve been to quite a few beginning of the year “let’s take stock of things” conferences in all the states recently, so perhaps I’ve become more impressed than usual by the medium-term to long-term challenges facing the region.  In the short run, however, the positive overall trend of the regional economy does seem to be a powerful offset to the continuing decline in real estate markets.  At our last meeting it seemed as though New England’s real estate problem was more significant than that in the rest of the country.  But now it appears that both are similarly affected whether one looks at prices, sale volumes, inventory growth, or declining construction.  As with the nation as a whole, there are signs of stabilization; but at least in New England, making any judgment about the imminent revival of real estate markets in midwinter is foolhardy at best. On the national scene, the data have been more upbeat since our last meeting.  Apparently the holiday season was a bright one, with consumption likely growing at a pace of more than 4 percent in the last quarter.  That’s remarkably strong given the continuing decline in residential real estate and proof—to reiterate what President Stern said—that the U.S. economy continues to be unusually resilient.  Supporting consumption are tight labor markets, lower energy prices, tighter though still reasonably accommodative financial conditions, strong corporate profits and some signs of revival in business spending after declines related to housing and motor vehicle expenditures, and continuing strong foreign growth.  Even inflation has moderated a bit, with three-month core price increases in both the PCE and the CPI trending down.  Our forecast in Boston and that of the Greenbook are virtually indistinguishable.  The last quarter of ’06 was stronger than expected.  The first quarter of this year will be slightly better as well, but after that, the trajectory remains the same as it has been for the past two or three meetings.  An increasing pace of growth in ’07 and ’08 as the housing and motor vehicle situations unwind, a slight rise in unemployment, and a fall in core PCE inflation to nearly 2 percent by the end of the forecast period.  In many ways, this is the definition of perfection, a forecast that is seemingly getting better each time we make it, with growth a bit higher, unemployment a bit lower, and inflation ebbing slightly more.  The underlying mechanics that produce this outcome are relatively straightforward, but I wonder whether we should have a heightened sense of skepticism about such a halcyon outlook.  Let me focus on two reasons for such skepticism. First, all other things being equal, inflation could be less than well behaved.  One reason that inflation ebbed in earlier forecasts was that slower growth brought about a small output gap and rising unemployment.  Now, the output gap is virtually eliminated, and unemployment remains below 5 percent.  Ebbing inflation is solely the product of recent favorable inflation readings, which are assumed to persist:  lower energy prices, declining import prices, and falling shelter prices.  It’s hard to tell at this point whether the recent readings on core inflation are the result of fundamentally lower inflation pressures or just luck or maybe a combination of the two.  I think a similar range of uncertainty applies to oil prices and the strength of the dollar.  With virtually no output gap, it seems to me that, while the baseline best guess might be lower inflation, for all of the reasons discussed in the Greenbook one should approach that analysis with some caution. Second, demand could well be stronger.  The baseline forecast assumes that consumers somehow get the message some of us have been trying to deliver about the need for an increase in private saving.  The saving rate moves from a negative 1 percent to a positive 1 percent, the highest saving rate in several years.  As I noted before, I have to ask myself why this is likely to happen over the next coming months when it hasn’t in the wake of the housing situation in 2006.  Clearly, the downturn in residential real estate, an important political issue in all our Districts and certainly devastating for subprime borrowers in particular, hasn’t affected consumer spending in general.  In fact, household net worth as a share of disposable income remains quite high, buoyed in part by a likely overestimate of real housing values but also by rising equity markets.  The timing of the needed increase in the personal saving rate could well be further out in the future, creating some version of the buoyant consumer alternative scenario instead of the baseline.  Again, with no output gap, the potential for increased inflationary pressure is obvious. In sum, the Greenbook forecast remains in my view the most likely baseline.  There are downside risks, as I mentioned before, for the seven alternative scenarios do anticipate some downside risks; but if the housing situation is beginning to stabilize, I find it hard to believe that broader anxiety about it will affect business spending or the consumer as some of these scenarios contemplate.  The bigger risk may well be that business spending picks up in light of consumer strength, unemployment stays low, growth exceeds our current projections, and resource pressures become more intense.  I am concerned that risks to inflation have grown somewhat since our last meeting.  I think I’m still in a “wait and see” mode, as I do believe there are downside risks to the evolution of housing markets.  But if the Greenbook growth forecast is right, the best risk management on our part may have to be to seek tighter policy sooner rather than later.,   Right.,   As I look at the forecast in the Greenbook, the higher saving rate—money out of income that’s expected to be there going into savings—is one element that makes consumption lower than it would otherwise be.,   In the forecast, yes.,   What was the number for domestic final purchases, Dave?,   No, the overall number."
"307";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have the sense that since our last meeting we’ve received a wealth of data but not necessarily a wealth of information.  Between the data that have come in and the conversations that I’ve had with my District contacts in the past six weeks, I’m a little more confident about the outlook for real growth, and I view the inflation outlook as unchanged.  Housing is an example of having more data, but not necessarily more information. Though some aspects of the residential housing data have been encouraging, neither futures on housing prices nor reports that I have received from people in the business suggest that the slowdown in that sector will end any time soon.  Despite that, it still looks as though the spillovers to consumer spending and financial markets have been limited.  At our last meeting, there was also some uncertainty regarding the health of the manufacturing sector.  For the most part, the intermeeting data have been favorable for the manufacturing sector.  The industrial production numbers, for example, have been strong, but manufacturing employment remains flat. The usual story that makes sense of these disparate trends is the continuing strength in manufacturing productivity.  But I’d like to mention another element in the picture—others have mentioned it this morning—and that’s the skills mismatches.  My directors and business contacts in the manufacturing sector tell me that they have jobs available but that they face great difficulty in filling those jobs because they can’t find people with the right skills.  Interestingly, as was mentioned in the staff presentation earlier, the JOLTS data show openings as rising, and that’s also true in the manufacturing sector.  Openings have been rising over the past two years.  This news really isn’t so good per se, but it does suggest that at least some of the sluggishness in manufacturing job growth is coming out of the structural elements in the labor markets and is not purely a cyclical decline in aggregate demand.  In a somewhat related vein, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, college placements are up 17 percent this year, the strongest showing since 2001.  The story is that relatively high profits and good business prospects are driving up demand.  We also understand from the Ohio governor’s office that last year, although sales tax receipts were lower, income tax receipts were stronger than expected. These bits and pieces combined with some of the positive news in the aggregate data reports in the past couple of months make me somewhat less worried about the downside risks to economic growth than I was at the last meeting.  I don’t want to go overboard on this.  I had that feeling several times last year only to be subsequently moved in the other direction.  It is hard to tell whether some of this good news has been related to weather—that is, some spring activity might have shifted into the fourth quarter. On the inflation front, both the official data and the anecdotal stories from my contacts continue to provide some encouragement that core inflation will moderate over the next year, but the data are not yet entirely convincing.  My staff has noted that for most of 2006, especially in the later half of the year, the growth rates of individual CPI components exhibited a bimodal distribution.  On an expenditure-weighted basis, most components were either falling in price or rising at a troubling rate.  Very few CPI components were rising at a pace that the CPI tells us is about average.  This pattern is highly unusual, and I don’t know what to make of it, except to say that it does make it more difficult to tell which way the inflation trend is leaning. My only material difference of opinion with the staff baseline projection concerns the assumption about labor supply.  Economywide, there is some reason to think that aggregate labor supply is more abundant than the Greenbook baseline contemplates.  Labor force participation rates for most demographic groups have been running stronger than the staff has been expecting, indicating that the growth of potential output could lie somewhat above the Greenbook estimate. That’s what I am assuming, and therefore I get a slightly better combination of output and inflation . In the end, my outlook for the economy hasn’t changed.  The general contours of the forecast for a modest slowdown in growth coupled with a very gradual decline in core inflation make sense to me.  However, I have lowered just slightly my assessment of the risk that real growth will fall short of my projection, and I have not changed my risk assessment of inflation.  There’s still a notable risk that year-over-year changes in inflation might remain stuck where they are today as opposed to drifting down half a point or so over time as I would prefer.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"308";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data on economic activity have been loaded with upside surprises for most spending categories and also for labor markets.  Our response, like the Greenbook, has been to boost our estimate of growth last quarter and our forecast for growth this quarter.  For 2007 as a whole, we have revised up our projection for real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point, to about 2¾ percent, which is just a bit below our estimate of the trend, which is a bit higher than the Greenbook.  This performance continues to reflect the so-called bimodal economy with weakness in housing and autos coupled with strength almost everywhere else. Looking beyond the first quarter, we interpret recent data as suggesting that the drag from both weak sectors is likely to diminish, providing impetus for an acceleration of activity later this year.  Even so, the Greenbook forecasts, and we agree, that other factors will likely offset this acceleration so that GDP will grow slightly below trend in 2007.  In particular, the Greenbook hypothesizes that the growth of consumer spending will slow, with the saving rate rising from minus ¾ percent at the end of last year to plus 1 percent at the end of next year.  This forecast strikes us as quite reasonable.  House-price appreciation has slowed dramatically, and the impetus it has given consumption should diminish over time.  In addition, the Greenbook notes, and Larry emphasized, that consumer spending has grown more rapidly than fundamentals can explain, and it’s sensible to predict some unwinding of this pattern.  Such an outcome, however, would represent a noticeable change in the trend of the saving rate.  So to me the possibility that the saving rate will not, in fact, rebound to the extent anticipated in the Greenbook constitutes a serious upside risk to the outlook.  Of course, the staff has emphasized this. An alternative simulation in the Greenbook illustrates that if spending instead advances in line with income, the unemployment rate would decline noticeably further from a level that is already low.  It is precisely because we are starting from a situation in which labor markets are already arguably tight that the upward revisions to growth during the intermeeting period particularly concern me.  Some period of below-trend growth may ultimately be necessary to address inflationary pressures emanating from the labor market. In December, I emphasized the puzzle presented by the combination of an apparently sluggish economy and a robust job market.  Upward revisions to estimated growth in the fourth and first quarters resolve a portion of that discrepancy.  Even so, Okun’s law still suggests that the excess demand in labor markets as reflected in the low unemployment rate is abnormally large relative to that in goods markets as reflected in estimates of the output gap.  The current low unemployment rate may turn out to have benign implications for inflation.  For example, labor market tightness may well diminish somewhat over time, given that the lags between output growth and labor market adjustments can be quite variable.  Another benign possibility is that the unemployment rate may be overstating the tightness of labor markets.  For example, some indicators of labor market conditions, like the Conference Board index for job market perceptions, suggest a bit of softening.  Indeed, available indexes of labor compensation do not provide compelling evidence of cost pressures emanating from the labor market.  However, compensation data are mixed, and I must admit that the signal from them is somewhat confusing. While I remain concerned about the risk that labor market pressures could boost inflation over time, I’m still fairly optimistic about the outlook for inflation overall.  Core inflation has come down in recent months, which is welcome, although we must be careful not to overreact.  Recent favorable data could reflect the dissipation of pressures from energy prices and owners’ equivalent rent; these sources of disinflation are inherently transitory, and once they are fully worked through the system, we will be left with the influence of more-enduring factors, such as the extent of excess demand or supply in labor and product markets.  If these markets are, in fact, unduly tight, we could eventually see rising inflation.  Inflation expectations also matter for the inflation outlook, and I see the stability of inflation expectations as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis.  As I previously mentioned, my staff and other researchers find some evidence that inflation has become less persistent over the past decade, a period during which inflation and inflation expectations have been low and stable.  Both survey and market-based estimates suggest that longer-term inflation expectations remain stable and well anchored. So to sum up, I continue to view a soft landing with moderating inflation as my best-guess forecast, conditional on maintaining the current stance of policy.  We expect core PCE price inflation to edge down from 2¼ percent last year to about 2 percent in 2007.  While there are risks on both sides of the outlook for growth, I’m a little more focused on the upside risks after the recent spate of strong data.  It’s encouraging that the recent inflation news has been good.  However, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about inflation going forward, and to me these risks remain biased to the high side."
"309";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070131meeting.csv";"  Charlie, I’m not sure I understand your thinking.  You said that you expect what sounded like a pretty significant moderation in core PCE, but that’s on a monetary policy assumption that implies further tightening.,   Though I don’t want to pin you down, that sounds sort of modest.  You are saying that with another 25 basis points you’d get what core PCE inflation over the forecast period?,   Just in orders of magnitude—if we did another 25 or 50 basis points and there were some sort of associated changes in overall financial conditions so that that was reinforced, you’d get a core PCE inflation forecast that would go how far down?  Would it go to 1.5?,   Does Mr. Lacker have an alternative explanation?,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a few quick points. We feel somewhat better about the outlook for growth and inflation, but we haven’t really changed our forecasts for ’07 and ’08.  So just as we expected over the past few cycles, we currently expect GDP to grow roughly at the rate of potential over the forecast period, which we believe is still around 3 percent, and we expect the rate of increase in the core PCE to moderate a bit more to just below 2 percent over the forecast period.  We see somewhat less downside risk to growth and somewhat less upside risk to inflation than we did, but the overall balance of risks in our view is still weighted toward inflation—the risk that it fails to moderate enough or soon enough.  The basic nature of the risks to both those elements of our forecast hasn’t really changed. As this implies, our forecast still has somewhat stronger growth and somewhat less inflation than the Greenbook does.  The differences, however, are smaller than they have been. We see the same basic story that the Greenbook does in support of continuing expansion going forward.  We have similar assumptions for the appropriate path of monetary policy—at least two, perhaps several, quarters of a nominal fed funds rate at current levels.  The main differences between our view about the economy and the Greenbook’s relate first, as they have for some time, to the likely growth in hours; we’re still not inclined to build in a substantial reduction in trend labor force growth.  Second, our view is that inflation has less inertia, less persistence, than it has exhibited over the past half-century.  Third, we tend to think that changes in wealth have less effect on consumer behavior than does the staff. We have seen a general convergence in views in the market, as we just discussed, toward a forecast close to this view, close to the center of gravity in this room, and a very significant change in policy expectations as well.  We can take some comfort from this, but I don’t think we should take too much.  Markets still seem to display less uncertainty about monetary policy and asset prices and quite low probabilities to even modest increases in risk premiums than I think is probably justified. Let me just go through the principal questions briefly.  Is the worst behind us in both housing and autos?  Probably, but we can’t be sure yet.  If we get some negative shock to income—to demand growth—we’re still vulnerable to a more adverse adjustment in housing prices with potentially substantially negative effects on growth, in part because of the greater leverage now on household balance sheets.  How strong does the economy look outside autos and housing?  Pretty strong, it seems.  We see no troubling signs of weakness, despite the disappointment on some aspects of investment spending.  What does the labor market strength tell us about the risk to the forecast?  It seems obvious that on balance it justifies some caution about upside risk to growth and more than the usual humility about what we know about slack and trend labor force growth.  But I don’t think it fundamentally offers a compelling case on its own for a substantial change to the inflation forecast or the risks to that forecast. Is there any new information on structural productivity growth?  Not in our view.  We’re still fairly comfortable with the staff view of around 2 percent or 2½ percent for the nonfarm business sector.  I’m not a great fan of the anecdote, but I’ll cite just one.  If you ask people who make stuff for a living on a substantial scale, it’s hard to find any concern that they are seeing diminished capacity to extract greater productivity growth in their core businesses.  That’s not a general observation, just a small one. Have the inflation risks changed meaningfully in either direction?  I think the recent behavior of the core numbers and of expectations is reassuring.  The market doesn’t seem particularly concerned about inflation, and the market is therefore vulnerable to a negative surprise, to a series of higher numbers.  Can we be confident we’ll get enough moderation with the current level of long-term expectations prevailing in markets, with the expected path of slack in the economy, and with the range of potential forces that might operate on relative prices— energy, import, and other prices?  Again, I think this forecast still seems reasonable, but we can’t be that confident, and we need to be concerned still about the range of sources of vulnerability of that forecast.  Another way to frame this question is, Is the inflation forecast consistent with the current expectations for the path of monetary policy acceptable to the Committee?  We haven’t fully confronted that issue because we don’t get much moderation with a monetary policy assumption that’s close to what’s in the markets.  But I don’t think there’s a compelling case to act at this stage in a way that forces convergence on that.  In other words, how tight is monetary policy, and how tight are overall financial conditions today?  I don’t think there’s a very strong case for us to induce more tightness or more accommodation than now prevails.  There’s a good case for patience and for giving ourselves a fair amount of flexibility going forward, within the context of an asymmetric signal about the balance of risks and a basic judgment that we view the costs of a more adverse inflation outcome as the predominant concern of the Committee."

[Coffee break],   If we could reconvene—I see a two-hander from Governor Kroszner.,   President Lockhart.,   Thank you.  President Stern.,   Thank you.  President Poole.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you.  Thank you very much for the comments.  I’m going to offer, as I always do, a brief summary and invite any comments and corrections, and then I’d like to add a few comments of my own.  Most participants today agree that growth looks as though it’s going to be slower, but there is some diversity of opinion about how persistent the slowdown would be.  Many people have marked down growth expectations for the remainder of the year, and there was a general sense that the uncertainty about growth prospects and downside risk have increased.  However, some people saw the current slowdown as only a soft patch that would be reversed soon.  Housing remains weak, and some participants noted the risk that problems in mortgage and credit markets and increased foreclosure rates might contribute to further weakness. However, others felt that the housing situation has not changed materially since the last meeting. The slowdown in capital investment drew more concern, in part because it has proved difficult to explain.  An inventory correction continues, but automobile inventories have been brought into line. Some factors that will support growth include a booming global economy and stronger government spending at both the federal and the state and local levels.  The labor market continues to be tight, with some noting increases in wages.  Developments in the labor, housing, and credit markets will be important in determining the future course of consumption. Several participants pointed to potential financial risks, including possible knock-on effects of the subprime mortgage problems and the possibility of the drying up of currently abundant liquidity and financial markets.  Corporate earnings are also likely to slow.  If these risks materialize, they could add to downside pressures on output.  However, some thought that financial conditions will remain supportive.  Some, but not all, think that inflation will continue to moderate, albeit very slowly.  There is general disappointment with recent inflation readings, and some were skeptical that any meaningful progress against inflation is being made.  In particular, resource utilization pressures, particularly tight labor markets, pose a longer-term inflation threat.  Import prices and slower productivity growth also add to inflation risk.  The views of most participants were that upside inflation risks still outweigh downside risks to output, that uncertainty has increased, and that the tails of the distribution have become fatter. Are there comments?  If not, let me just add a few thoughts.  It’s very difficult to speak last—all the good ideas have already been presented.  So I’ll say just a few things. I think the growth outlook is slightly worse.  The housing market is, of course, central to near-term developments.  The central scenario that housing will stabilize sometime during the middle of the year remains intact, but there have been a few negative innovations.  We’ve noted the subprime issues and the possibility of foreclosures, reduced confidence, and tightened credit terms, and I’ve also noted that reports from builders about the spring selling season have not been particularly upbeat, in general.  At the same time, we continue to see rough stability in sales, starts, and permits.  The effects of the decline in subprime lending may have already been mostly seen, since that has slowed from last fall.  Mortgage rates, of course, remain quite low, and the labor market is a key determinant of housing demand and of mortgage delinquencies, particularly cross- sectionally.  Across the country, there’s a very close correlation between foreclosure rates and state unemployment rates.  So long as the labor market remains strong, I would think that the general health of the housing market would be improving.  The housing market, I think, will follow the same scenario, but there are a few negative innovations. There was a lot of discussion about capital investments, and I share the puzzlement about why that’s happening.  Like Governor Mishkin, I am concerned that it might signal something about productivity.  Another possibility in the current environment goes back to my Ph.D. thesis on the effects of uncertainty on investment, which found that greater uncertainty can make people delay their commitments.  In our last meeting, we discussed the possible upside risk to consumption.  I think that risk is much diminished now.  Our retail sales have been quite flat, and the strong growth of consumption in the first quarter is almost entirely due to the December blip, which will carry through to the quarterly arithmetic.  But consumption is very likely to slow.  Gas prices are another reason that consumption is likely to slow.  The labor market, again, remains strong.  I agree with the Greenbook that there is some likelihood of softening going forward.  In particular, I think Governor Kohn mentioned that the slowing productivity growth we’re seeing could be consistent with some labor hoarding in this late stage of the cycle. Again, I’ve marked down my growth expectations only a bit, but if we were handicapping recessions, I’m afraid that risk has probably gone up a bit.  I would cite at least three reasons.  First, there seems to be a pretty good chance that potential output growth is lower than in the past; and almost by definition, if growth is lower, then the chance of negative quarters is greater.  Second, the Greenbook has a 60 basis point increase in unemployment occurring stably over the next two years. If that happens, it will be the first time it has ever happened.  [Laughter]  Generally speaking, increases in unemployment tend either not to occur or to be bigger than 60 basis points.  Finally, we’ve discussed the financial market sensitivities, which are having an effect, so that changes in the outlook could have pretty substantial feedback effects onto the economy through the stock market, other financial markets, and credit markets.  So I think, as President Fisher does, that the tail in that direction is unfortunately somewhat fatter. Likewise with inflation, the news was disappointing.  We knew that there would be—and we have seen—month-to-month volatility.  It is difficult, as President Pianalto noted, to make a firm conclusion based on the recent data about whether or not inflation is moderating.  I would just note that rents and owners’ equivalent rent are still pretty important here.  They have not yet slowed much, which may have to do with the nature of the uncertainties about the housing market.  That possibility will be helpful going forward.  At an earlier meeting I indicated that medical costs were a risk; and they have, indeed, proved to be a risk. Speaking about inflation makes me reflect on the difficulties of measuring aggregate supply in general.  As we think about the economy going forward, we face two countervailing possibilities. One, which I and several others have already mentioned, is that potential output growth may well be lower than many outsiders and maybe even the Greenbook think.  Obviously that will make it difficult to get economic slack and will make this situation much more challenging.  At the same time, the lack of wage acceleration at least raises the possibility that the NAIRU might be somewhat lower than 5 percent, which would be helpful in the other direction.  With respect to inflation, again, as I said, I’m disappointed by the recent numbers.  I don’t get a sense from business people or from surveys and so on that the general public’s worry about inflation has increased very much, except insofar as they perceive that inflation is constraining the Fed from acting.  So, again, I don’t think we’ve seen an adverse breakout by any means, but obviously we’re going to have to remain very vigilant and make sure that we maintain our credibility on the inflation front. As the last item, I would like Vincent to distribute table 1.  We made a couple of changes in the description of the economy.  He can make a few comments, and then everyone will have an opportunity to look at it overnight, and we can discuss the communication issues tomorrow."
"311";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, I was reminded the other day that the original story of Goldilocks was not quite as we later came to learn it.  The first version that was drafted was actually called Silver Hair.  When the three bears came back to the house, the elderly lady, not the little girl, jumped out the window.  That was the beginning of the Goldilocks story, which was later adapted to a more palatable commercial story.  [Laughter]  I’m not ready to jump out the window yet, but I do have some concerns, and I’d like to talk about three areas—the international side, where the porridge seems to be hot; the domestic economy, where it seems to be cooling; and in my District, where it seems to be just about right. So, first, on the international side, just to complement some of Karen’s points, our research and anecdotal findings show that global capacity utilization has moved to the higher end of its range.  World unemployment rates have been falling.  Capacity expansion seems to be underpaced, even though there is some structural change in utilization, and it seems insufficient to meet demand or quell inflation.  Prices for imported U.S. goods have clearly moved away from deflationary trends to neutral or slightly inflationary, as I reported before—and, by the way, across nearly all product categories.  The growing tightness in the market for skilled foreign labor may be the contributing factor.  A very large foreign retailer operating in China reports that they are seeing wage price inflation for the first time in the stores that they are opening and operating.  As one of the high-tech CEOs mentioned to me earlier, even the Indians that they now import, not by bringing them physically across but by fiber optic cable, are being priced much more expensively.  If you add turnover, these workers have become increasingly expensive.  We see pressure from the shippers, noting that there are continued upward pressures on fleet utilization, spot prices, and port congestion.  Airlines are reporting stronger international loads and price traction than in the United States.  Express shippers and logistic companies are reporting double-digit growth in the year to date in Europe and still higher rates of growth in Asia.  So, on balance, our view from the Dallas Fed from the international perspective is that international data and anecdotal evidence point to some excess demand outside the United States with concomitant increases in price pressures. Turning to the domestic scene, we appear to be sailing between the Charybdis of a slowdown in the economy and the Scylla of higher inflation.  I want to talk about both.  We’re both measuring and hearing of greater fragility in the domestic economy relating to economic growth and the kind of excess that is leading to the financial turbulence that Janet spoke about. I’ll turn to that in a second.  Also, we’re not encouraged, despite our wishful thinking, on the inflationary front.  Let me just give you some points other than those that have already been mentioned, particularly other than capital spending, which we see slowing across the nation. Express shippers, logistic companies, report 0.2 percent growth year over year for domestic ground operations and weaker-than-expected overall growth, between 0 and 0.5 percent on balance in the year to date—substantially less than they expected.  Rail car loadings are flat to down, reflecting the decline in demand for materials for housing and a decline in durable goods orders.  Truck tonnage is off, and orders for replacement of fleets seem to be reflecting more than the effect of these new engine regulations that are going into place.  I’ll give you one data point mentioned:  Peterbilt’s order book is one-third of what it was last year.  Airlines report weaker domestic booking and slackening demand relative to last year.  With regard to the retailers, I have been urged to be cautious in analyzing the data, first because last year was in essence a fifty-three-week year because of the late holiday or a thirteen-month year due to gift cards.  Our contacts report continued strength for high-end retailers, 3 to 6 percent unit growth in the first quarter for middle retailers like Kohl’s and JCPenney, and significantly lower growth rates with companies like Wal-Mart praying that the advancement of daylight savings time will lift them from flat growth to 1 to 2 percent comps.  Finally, restaurants report continued movement down the food chain—no pun intended—[laughter] from the middle-income eateries to the McDonald’s of the world.  If you notice McDonald’s reports, they are quite stout, whereas the middle-income eateries are suffering.  In short, we expect slower top-line growth across the board. I want to talk for a minute about housing.  One of my contacts at Wal-Mart mentioned that, when they recently surveyed their customers, concerns about housing did not even rank in the top ten of consumers’ concerns.  Despite that, a large housebuilder, whom I mentioned in previous conversations around this table, says that they have gone from monsoons to scattered thunderstorms, and another reports a decline in the need to grant concessions.  Yet both are concerned about subprime and alt-A infection, as one called it.  Going back to our previous conversation, one of the builders, whose average home price exceeds 300,000, has through thorough analysis just discovered that 40 percent of last year’s builds were financed by alt-A mortgages.  If you look at the security analysis for that particular company, the best guesstimate is 20 percent.  So, being from the Clinton Administration, I’m a bit worried; I’m getting to the point where “don’t ask, don’t tell” may be the best approach to interviewing some of these homebuilders.  Clearly, they are concerned.  They have an overstock of inventory, and they’re beginning to cut back significantly on activity.  If you remember, David, originally I did talk about a 25 percent peak-to-trough correction when you were not quite at that number.  Now I’ve caught up with you.  I’m at 40 percent at a minimum and quite concerned about it. I’m also concerned about what President Yellen referred to as a possibility for a retrenchment in the credit markets.  I point, as others have done, to the significant oversupply of private-equity capital.  To give you a specific example, in the case of Texas Utilities, between a Friday and a Wednesday, the two principal investors lined up $2.5 billion apiece, another billion from five other equity investors, and in the end over $50 billion of committed capital from the banks in a two-day lineup period, only half of which was used.  So, Mr. Chairman, in short, in the domestic economy, I’m concerned that the tail in terms of a recession has not become slimmer as I mentioned last time.  I would redact those words.  I believe it has become fatter, and I believe that financial market turbulence has a potential to become greater. As to the Scylla of inflation, I keep telling myself, David, that with the passage of time we’ll see improvement, that one month’s set of numbers such as we had in December does not a trend make.  I tell myself that two months’ numbers, like those we saw in December and January, do not a trend make.  But the numbers are less than comforting.  On a six-month basis through January, both our trimmed mean at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank and your PCE excluding food and energy are stuck at 2.1 percent.  On a twelve-month basis, the trimmed mean was stuck at 2.5 percent, and your PCE excluding food and energy was 2.3 percent.  The recent CPI report was hardly encouraging.  Sixty-eight percent of the components rose 3 percent or more.  To be sure, there are tamer OER readings, but they’re being offset by a pickup in core goods inflation.  I continue to worry about the political effect of this kind of inflationary run.  I note yesterday’s headline in the Christian Science Monitor stating that “inflation is eating up U.S. wage gains.” On the regional side, what I’ve reported above is reflected to some extent in the Eleventh District.  Growth has slowed, but housing prices are stable, and housing inventories are thus far healthy.  Yet we continue to experience significant wage price pressures.  Our dynamics are much stronger than those of the rest of the nation.  One of the credit card companies reports that sales using their cards in our region were up 10.5 percent year over year through February, versus 1 to 4 percent on the eastern and western seaboards. In short, Mr. Chairman, I see geographic dispersion in the growth patterns—strong growth overseas, relatively strong growth in our District, and a developing worrisome growth scenario for the rest of the United States.  We see less abatement of inflation than we had hoped for.  With regard to preparing for tomorrow’s discussion about what to do about it, I find myself on the horns of a dilemma.  I would say that the risks are more evenly balanced, and yet the tail of less growth and the risk of recession and the other tail of awfully stubborn inflation have fattened and not trimmed.  Thank you."
"312";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, I’ll spend a little time on the District.  I think you can describe it as almost robust, recognizing that we are a District that exports a lot of raw materials and byproducts of raw materials.  We have had solid job gains led by further tightening in our labor markets, and recent revisions suggest that 2006 job growth was stronger than we had previously thought.  Mining led the job growth, but we also saw strong gains in professional and business services and in leisure and hospitality.  In fact, our ski season this year was a record, as the snow was also a record.  Besides shortages of skilled labor, of which we are constantly getting reports, we are seeing also shortages of some lower-skilled workers as well—in the temporary employment area, for example. It is also noteworthy that our manufacturing activity has been strengthening.  We have received good reports from our directors and advisory council members that it actually strengthened in February.  Lower inventories of finished goods led to a surge in order backlogs, and most industries reported robust activity led by machinery and high-tech equipment production.  In addition, plant managers expressed greater optimism about the outlook for employment and capital spending as they look forward, not as they’re looking right now. Turning to real estate, housing activity may have stabilized.  We have suffered like the rest of the country in that area, especially in our Denver market, where we have had record levels of foreclosure.  But beyond that—and even there—we have seen some stabilizing in our housing market, and our commercial activity remains really quite solid.  Housing permits and the value of new residential construction held steady in February.  In addition, the buildup of home inventories has actually slowed, and District contacts expect inventories to decline gradually in the coming months, as they are now seeing things turn.  Nonresidential construction remains strong, with absorption of office space increasing in most cities and vacancy rates continuing to decline throughout our region.  Commercial real estate contacts expect more new construction in the months ahead.  They are actually seeing it come on the drawing board.  They also reported that office prices and rents increased further, even though sales were somewhat flat over the last month or so. Farm financial conditions have improved overall, with increased crop prices that are being driven by the expanded ethanol production.  USDA forecasts that net farm income will rise about 10 percent this year.  Strong income prospects have boosted land prices—significantly, I might add, in some parts—and solidified farm balance sheets.  One piece of information I would note is that ethanol is a boom industry right now in the region—not in just our region but in the area around Nebraska and Iowa.  In that area, 100 plants are producing; there are 50 on the drawing boards, but we are seeing some backing away from that.  Three projects have been pulled back in Oklahoma recently, and one more in Kansas.  But still, a lot are going forward, and it gives me some pause because it has the tone of too much, too quickly, and the real economy will suffer if it backs away from that development.  Anyway, on balance, the regional economy is very strong right now. Turning to the national outlook, I would say that, on balance, although I have revised my outlook down somewhat in 2007, I still have it projected as growing on the whole for the year better than 2½ percent.  So my outlook is more optimistic than that of the Greenbook.  There are some reasons for that, at least that we’re thinking through.  Like others, we see housing stabilizing, perhaps taking a little longer to come back, but inventories seem to have stabilized. As those inventories are worked off through the first half of this year, we think housing should improve through the rest of the year, at least given where the fixed interest rates lie.  We’re also seeing that the secondary effects of the slowing of the housing market seem contained at the moment, so that slowing is not spilling over, and the containment is being strengthened by the facts that personal incomes are actually continuing to improve and that we have a good labor market.  So those factors are important.  Also, as we discussed earlier, foreign demand is strong, and the outlook seems to be good.  Finally, federal spending—the fact is that we’re fighting a war, and you tend to spend more over the course of a war—is picking up I think.  Coffers are strong, and states are spending at a fairly rapid rate.  So a lot of factors are affecting demand, and therefore I think that this economy will pick up as the year goes on. I recognize very clearly that there are some risks to keep in mind.  One is that the housing market could worsen, and there could be further spillovers.  I’m very mindful of that.  But on the other side, I do share some of the concerns raised by others in terms of the inflation outlook. Inflation has not come down as much as we had hoped, although I’m still projecting that it will so long as we keep the rates at their current levels.  But there are some upside risks with the tighter labor market and strong demand, and we could see energy prices putting more pressure on it.  So it’s a mixed bag perhaps with, on balance, some upside risk as well as downside risk to this economy.  Thank you."
"313";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many others, I view the data over the intermeeting period as not fundamentally undermining the basic contours of our expected forecast. We’re still on track for moderate growth and gradually ebbing inflation.  The economy has enough underlying strength, bolstered by financial conditions that remain quite supportive of growth, so that the housing correction should not be enough to knock the economy off the moderate growth track. Growth modestly below potential, along with the unwinding of some special factors like rent increases, should allow further declines in inflation. Real-side data reflect the fact that the downshift from above-trend growth for several years to expansion at or a little below trend hasn’t been entirely smooth, and maybe we never should have expected it to be so.  Besides the overpricing and overbuilding of housing, businesses apparently built their stocks of inventories and fixed capital in anticipation of continued strong growth, and we’re seeing downshifts in demand for inventories and capital to align them with the slower pace of expected growth.  Businesses typically also hoard labor under these circumstances, resulting in weaker productivity growth, and we may just be seeing this adjustment getting under way, judging from the gradual upcreep in initial and continuing claims.  The inherently uneven nature of the stock adjustment process and the uncertainty around it help to explain both the overall contours of the recent data and the short-run swings in the data and perceptions of them. A number of factors, most of them mentioned by others, do support expectations of moderate growth ahead.  Outside the subprime market, financial conditions remain supportive of growth.  Intermediate and long-term rates are low in real as well as in nominal terms.  The dollar has fallen.  The fallout from the recent turbulence has been very limited.  Aside from housing, a good portion of the inventory correction is behind us or is being put behind us.  So over time production ought to line up better with sales.  Both a rise in the national ISM index and increases in industrial commodity prices, especially in metals, support the notion of a coming recovery in manufacturing, though I admit the increase in metals prices may be a factor of the global economic expansion as well.  Continued good growth of jobs to date will support increases in personal income, and as many have remarked, growth in the rest of the world has been pretty strong.  I was struck by the upward revision in rest-of-world growth in the Greenbook despite weakness in the United States, the rise in oil prices, and the decline in equity values.  So as Karen remarked, domestic demand abroad seems to be strengthening, and I think this bodes well for global external adjustment as well as for U.S. exports. But the information we have received over the intermeeting period not only shifted expected growth down a little but also highlighted some downside risk to activity.  In housing, those downside risks center on the implications of the subprime debacle.  Will it affect housing demand? Will lending terms tighten beyond the subprime market and the mortgage market?  How much will tightening spill over to other lending markets, such as home equity lines of credit, and perhaps affect consumer demand?  The possible answers to these questions seem to me to have downside tails that are fatter than the upside tails.  Unexpected weakness in investment spending outside housing and auto-related industries is another risk factor.  The question is whether this weakness represents just a short-term adjustment to moderate growth or whether businesses themselves see a downside shift in underlying demand that we don’t see.  Financial conditions may not remain as supportive of growth, besides the possibility of the dropping of other shoes, such as private equity, as many have mentioned.  I see a distinct downside risk to the staff’s assumption of continued increases in equity prices given the likelihood that, if the economy evolves the way the staff anticipates, long-term interest rates will rise and profits will be very disappointing to market analysts. Despite weaker spending, we still face upside risks to the gradual downdrift in inflation. Recent data haven’t been as favorable to deceleration as we would have hoped:  Softer investments, slower growth of productivity, and continued strength in labor markets could suggest a slower path of trend productivity growth.  If so, we would need to adjust down our expectations for growth, and labor costs would get a boost even at slower growth rates unless increases in nominal wages also downshifted pretty promptly.  Good growth in labor demand could suggest a stronger path for demand and less slack than the staff is estimating.  Finally, the NAIRU could well be lower than the 5 percent that the staff is estimating, especially in light of the relatively slow updrift in many measures of compensation.  But, at 4½ percent, the unemployment rate is low by historical standards, and this suggests to me that the risks from resource utilization remain toward higher inflation.  In sum, downside risks to our maximum employment objective have increased, but I do not think they outweigh the continuing upside risk to more-moderate inflation, at least not yet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"314";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  I haven’t received it.  If you sent it by mail, it could take a while.,   Okay, great.,   I just wanted to mention with respect to foreclosures and wanted to double-check my facts—a note had been sent out from the Board’s Consumer and Community Affairs Division to your consumer and community affairs groups concerning your activities in mortgage foreclosures, and Jeff Lacker fortunately has invited me to a conference two days from now, at which I will be speaking.  Unfortunately, I will be unable to be at the hearing at which Sandy Braunstein will be appearing.  Regardless of what you might think of me in this regard, please be sure to get things in to help Sandy out.  I think a lot of good activities are being done in all the regional Federal Reserve Banks, and if we could just get a little information to her so that she has a few examples to give, that would be very helpful.  Then we will follow up in the longer run because we hope to do a larger program here on some of these issues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   Just the opposite—Sandy could use examples showing that we’ve done some outreach to help deal with some of the challenges of foreclosure.  Are there educational efforts or studies that have been done?,   Thank you very much.  I very much agree with President Stern’s characterization that, although some of the incoming data are a bit weaker than we had been seeing, we certainly shouldn’t overreact.  Optimally, we should react to what the data tell us about the future, and I’m not sure we’ve learned an enormous amount about the future over the past few months.  Actually Dave has kept a very steady hand on the forecast throttle because we have seen a lot of data come in over the past six months, but they haven’t led to much change in the Greenbook forecast, and I think that’s quite reasonable.  Given that some of the numbers have come in slightly weaker and given some of the market volatility, I think that uncertainty is a bit up; so the tails are somewhat fatter, and I agree with the number of people who had said that. Quickly looking at GDP from the C + I + G + net exports context, I think net exports will be reasonably robust as world growth, at least over the next few quarters, is going to be fairly strong. We also heard a lot of anecdotal support for that.  On both the state and federal levels, government spending is likely to continue at a pace that will certainly not reduce demand and may have the potential to add to demand.  But when it comes to consumption and investment, that’s where the uncertainties are.  I won’t restate the concerns that several of you have raised about the deepening puzzle in investment.  I mentioned this at the last meeting—that for many months we’ve been seeing very good balance sheets, good employment numbers, good sentiment, good returns, and so on and so forth, but no pickup in investment.  Given that we’ve now gone at least six months without seeing that pickup, I am concerned that, with the greater uncertainty that seems to be in the markets, we may not see that pickup and that somehow our models may be missing something that should be in there but that has not been there in the past. The other area of the greatest uncertainty is related to the subprime market.  As you know now, we and the other federal regulators put out for comment—actually right at the end of the week of the increased concern about volatility in the subprime market—guidance with respect to subprime mortgages, the so-called 2/28s and 3/27s.  That is still out for comment.  We’re very mindful of some of the comments that have been raised here about whether that could inappropriately reduce the supply of credit in this market, and in the notice of proposed rulemaking, we have really emphasized questions about what the unintended consequences are.  So we want to make sure that we get information in on that.  Some loans that were made may have been inappropriate, but there may have been some that were completely appropriate.  We want to make sure that, when we put out the guidance, we don’t choke off the appropriate loans. The supervision and regulation staff has surveyed five active lenders in the subprime market that represent about 30 percent of that market.  We’ve gotten data so far from three of the five. From some of them it’s a bit difficult to get the data quickly because of a fair amount of management turnover, but we are still working on it.  But I think it’s a healthy thing that there are some delays.  What’s interesting is that one of the main concerns is refinancing:  What will happen to these guys because this market seems to be drying up.  As we discussed at the beginning, it’s really the variable-rate subprime market.  The subprime market is roughly 13 percent of the total mortgages outstanding.  The variable-rate subprime is about 7.4 percent of total mortgages outstanding, nearly two-thirds of the subprime market.  The fixed-rate part has not had any uptick in delinquencies.  Because of the inversion of the yield curve, the people who may be facing increases in their variable rates may be able to refinance into fixed-rate subprimes.  Over ’06, the average introductory adjustable-rate subprime mortgages were in the 7 percent to 9 percent area—depending on the loan-to-value ratio, debt-to-income ratio, and so forth—if income was stated.  Right now, to refinance into fixed rate, the range is about 7½ percent to 9½ percent.  It’s fairly similar, so many of these people may be able to move into this area. One thing that we want to know is what happens after people get these loans.  What do they do with them next?  In the survey, about 25 percent of the loans were retained by the individual banks, and so we could follow through what happened to the borrowers when they refinanced; but we see only 25 percent.  Obviously this share could be heavily selective, but it still may be somewhat interesting to know that about 40 percent of those on whom we have some information actually moved into a prime product.  About 34 percent went into a fixed subprime; and the rest, about 25 percent, refinanced to another type of variable subprime.  So a fair number of these are able to move either into prime or into fixed subprime.  Although this sample is obviously selective, it says something about the likely effects going forward.  The benefits, at least in the short run, of the inverted yield curve are that many of these individuals will have a lot of opportunities to refinance into a fixed product that will have payments similar to the ones that they’re paying now rather than ones that would be much higher. That said, the situation suggests that the concerns about what will happen to the market may not be as strong as some people have said.  We still don’t know, as President Fisher said, a lot about the alt-A market.  That market almost by definition is low documentation or no documentation.  The FICO scores tend to be higher.  From the survey, a lot of these people appear to be self-employed, so it becomes more difficult to independently verify the income that they have.  That’s a large part of the market, but obviously potentially a very risky part of the market.  Fortunately, it’s not an enormous part of the market, and so it doesn’t seem to be a major challenge going forward. Certainly there are some potential challenges, but I think some of the data from the survey are interesting. With respect to inflation pressures, I think very much like Dave (now that he’s a much more balanced person than he was earlier in 2006), that we see neither intensifying nor abating inflationary pressures.  You know, some of the numbers more recently have not been as favorable as they could be, but they are certainly by no means out of control.  Expectations continue to appear well anchored and well contained.  We don’t know a lot about what’s driving short-term to intermediate-term inflation dynamics.  It’s hard to see lots of correlations with unemployment rates, economic activity, resource utilization, energy prices, and other things.  I have been hoping to see and we have been seeing a gradual downtrend that seems to be flattening out to neither intensifying nor abating, which leaves us with some concerns going forward about the upside potential to inflation."
"315";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall, economic activity in the Fifth District expanded modestly in recent weeks, though performance across sectors remains uneven. Growth is centered in the services sector, where moderately positive readings continue.  Real activity has recovered somewhat in recent weeks, and big-ticket sales have posted modest gains after two months of quite weak readings.  In manufacturing, our survey respondents continue to report a downward drift in activity.  They remain optimistic about their future prospects, however, though many comment on generally weak current demand.  Labor markets remain tight in most jurisdictions, with the standard reports of spot shortages of skilled workers, but wage pressures are reported to be moderate.  We continue to hear of some reasonably firm housing activity in a number of District localities.  Home prices remain generally flat, though builders are offering more incentives to buyers.  Inflation pressures appear to have moderated in March according to our latest survey, but manufacturers and service providers expect price pressures to increase modestly over the next six months. On the national level, risks seem to have risen lately, but my sense is that prospects are still reasonably sound.  Subprime mortgages, obviously, have dominated the financial news in recent weeks.  Concerns about the welfare of families suffering foreclosure are quite natural, and anecdotes about outright fraud suggest some criminality.  But my overall sense of what’s going on is that an industry of originators and investors simply misjudged subprime mortgage default frequencies.  Realization of that risk seems to be playing out in a fairly orderly way so far. Mortgage-backed securities have lost value as risk spreads have widened, and there have been insolvencies among firms that specialized in this sector.  The updating of risk estimates in light of recent experience will lead to higher borrowing costs in the affected market segments, and at the margin this increase could shift some households from homeownership to renting.  But in my judgment, that isn’t likely to affect the net demand for housing units.  Notably, we have not seen broader risks to credit availability in other markets or to the financial safety net.  Perhaps the greatest economic risk posed by recent subprime developments is legislation that impedes the availability of credit or that provides financial support ex-post that was unanticipated ex-ante but affects private decisionmaking henceforth, somewhat like ad hoc disaster relief. Housing construction continues to contract, of course, and inventories remain elevated. The choppy winter data make it hard to gauge the descent, but overall home sales seem to be holding steady, and we haven’t heard anything locally that suggests a renewed contraction in demand.  So the housing outlook hasn’t changed much for me.  However, the recent weakness in business investment has been disappointing.  One would expect soft patches related to housing, autos, and the new truck regulations, but the broader sluggishness is a bit at odds with the generally favorable fundamentals.  I still expect this investment to pick up ultimately, although I have to admit that the recent data have left me a bit less certain, especially about when.  The outlook for consumer spending remains fairly healthy, though.  Real disposable income growth has been powered by continuing gains in employment and firmer wage growth.  So all in all, I still think the current episode of below-trend growth is fundamentally a transitory phenomenon that will most likely be behind us by the end of the year, although the recent weakness in business investment suggests more downside risk than before. Core inflation continues to firm, and it now seems clear that the fourth quarter’s energy- induced lull is over.  We have yet to see much sign of the long-awaited easing in resource utilization.  It’s not obvious that we will be getting any help from labor costs any time soon, and inflation expectations remain centered at or above 2 percent.  So to me, the prospects for moderation in inflation remain tenuous.  I continue to believe that, by summer, growth concerns are likely to be behind us, and we will want to act to reduce inflation, which we recognize is higher than we want.  Thank you.,   I’m sorry.  What are you looking for examples of—mortgages we foreclosed on?  [Laughter]"
"316";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you for the earlier welcome.  Over the intermeeting period, aggregate economic activity in the Sixth District showed signs of slowing. Manufacturing activity appeared to soften, with the majority of reports suggesting declining orders. Retail reports pointed to a slowing pace of sales.  The BLS employment data revisions for 2006 supported the view that Florida’s economy has decelerated considerably in the wake of the housing downturn.  Sales tax data suggest that retail spending in Florida actually declined in late 2006. Recovery on the Gulf Coast of Mississippi and Louisiana continues to proceed more slowly than hoped.  The immediate post-hurricane boost to spending has waned, and the problems of housing and insurance availability remain largely unresolved. The biggest concern for the Sixth District continues to be in real estate markets.  As stated at the last meeting, it appears to be too early to suggest that the region’s housing situation has stabilized or that the housing sector’s drag on the District has ended.  Reports indicate that many areas in Florida are experiencing dramatic declines in sales of single-family homes and condos, even while new product continues to come onto the market.  As a result of this oversupply, construction plans have been cut back.  In January, permit issuance for single-family homes in Florida was 57 percent lower than a year earlier.  For the rest of the United States the decline was 25 percent.  Permits for multifamily development declined 40 percent versus a 7 percent decline nationally.  This situation is most extreme in Florida.  Interestingly, we do hear anecdotal reports of improved potential buyer traffic in Florida, but that improvement is not translating into sales. Buyers appear to be expecting lower prices.  In the other states in the District, single-family permits were down 19 percent in January, less than the decline nationally. Regarding the region’s exposure to nonprime and subprime mortgages, the concern is again mostly in Florida.  According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, over 9 percent of mortgages serviced in Florida in the fourth quarter of 2006 were subprime ARM loans; this exposure was second only to Nevada, which was at 13 percent, and compares with 6½ percent nationally.  In contrast, the exposures of the other states in the District were all at or below the national level. Reports from banking contacts suggest that delinquency rates on nonprime ARM loans in Florida will continue to trend higher this year.  Reduced access to credit for nonprime borrowers will slow the absorption of the current oversupply of housing product and will put downward pressure on house prices.  Also, the boom in condo conversions and condo construction in 2005 and 2006 drained the supply of apartments in many areas in the District, and landlords have been able to increase rental prices as a result. Turning to our perspective on the country as a whole, much of the slowdown in real activity that occurred in the second half of 2006 reflected weakness in the housing sector.  If weakness remains contained within the housing sector, the outlook, although subdued, is acceptable in our view.  Much of the recent moderation in real activity is consistent with what we had forecast several months ago.  Realization of this moderation does not in itself imply that we should revise our outlook.  Some professional forecasters continue to anticipate that real GDP growth will rebound to close to its trend rate of 3 percent for the rest of 2007, in effect discounting any drag from prolonged weakness in residential investment.  The Atlanta Fed staff forecasts for real GDP growth are consistent with these optimistic commercial forecasts.  The current Greenbook forecast implies a slightly weaker outlook from extended weakness in residential investment and weaker growth of consumer expenditures, perhaps incorporating some signal from the recent financial distress in subprimes.  Despite slight differences in these forecasts, the outlooks do not suggest recession at this point.  Measured core inflation remains in excess of 2 percent.  Our staff consensus forecast sees core inflation continuing in the range of 2 to 2½ percent for all of 2007.  This forecast is a bit less favorable than the Greenbook forecast, but we have no sense that the inflation outlook has deteriorated significantly. The implications of the outlook for real output and inflation are that current policy is set about where it should be.  The U.S. economy has performed about as expected.  Financial market turbulence and subprime mortgage distress raise potential concerns that should be monitored, but for now it seems that the outlook has not substantially changed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"317";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  We want to be the good guys.,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One way I think about the situation is to compare what’s happening now, not to the last meeting, but to two meetings before.  From December to January we had positive news.  Now we have gone from January to March, and we’ve had negative news.  When you look at the overall picture, we’re not in a very different place from where we were in December, although I do think that there’s actually more uncertainty around the forecast.  So let me go into a little more detail on this.  I’m much less worried about the housing market as a serious downside risk.  First of all, I do see signs of stabilization of demand, and I really agree very much with what Randy just discussed.  First of all, this market is a fairly small part of the overall mortgage market.  Also, there are ways for people to work out their situations.  So the subprime market has really been overplayed in the media, and I do not see it as that big a downside risk.  I am comfortable with the fact that we have lowered our forecast on housing a bit, but the numbers that just came in recently were actually ones that indicate some stabilization there—in terms of housing demand, in particular. When I worry about the risk to the forecast, I’m really much more worried about capital expenditure in terms of investment.  The problem here is that the fundamentals look fairly strong and yet we haven’t seen strong business fixed investment.  I ask myself, “Well, what’s going on?” One possibility is that, in fact, there will be a bounceback—that these strong fundamentals in terms of balance sheets and so forth will produce actually stronger investment in the future, and I think that is a significant possibility.  However, I’m really a bit more worried that the weak capital expenditures may indicate that something deeper is wrong in terms of the fundamentals.  In particular, I’m a bit worried about the issue of what could be happening to productivity in the future. We’ve seen some weaker numbers in terms of productivity, and we think that is just sort of cyclical and not a change in structural productivity.  But maybe the business sector is seeing something that we’re not seeing, and in that context, businesses may not be investing as much because they don’t see that productivity will be that strong in the future.  They don’t see the returns in the future, and so they’re not investing as much.  That’s actually bad news in several dimensions.  One dimension would be that it would actually indicate a serious downside risk in terms of aggregate demand.  Also if productivity is lower, that’s not a good thing for inflation.  So the situation here is one about which I’m not super worried; but the environment is more complicated, and it makes our jobs more interesting.  [Laughter]  There is, of course, the Chinese curse that you should live through interesting times, but we’ll have more-interesting FOMC meetings. On the inflation front, I am comfortable with the view that the Greenbook and others have expressed that we should expect some moderate decrease in inflation.  In fact, the latest data don’t really get me that nervous on this.  However, we must recognize that, when we have more-anchored inflation expectations, it’s actually harder to forecast the little blips in inflation because what’s really going on is what’s left—it is no longer the trend but just the transitory movements, and those are particularly hard to forecast.  So there is a bad side to the overall better news, but I think the key is that inflation expectations seem to be very solidly grounded.  It’s hard to know exactly what the numbers are, but they seem to be around 2 percent.  So it’s realistic to think that, in fact, inflation is going to move toward the 2 percent level, although there may be some blips up and down. However, it is also important to recognize that I don’t see any reason for its dropping much below that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"318";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Seventh District are similar to what I reported last time.  Business activity continues to expand at a modest pace. However, while my contacts expressed some increased uncertainty, most of them maintained a positive view about the outlook for the second half of the year.  As we know, the two sectors that generated the most uncertainty this round are housing and business investment, and so I want to concentrate some of my comments on those two areas. On the housing front, my contacts continue to be unsure about how soon the turnaround will be.  A director from Pulte Homes saw hints of a better tone in the market but acknowledged that signs were still tentative.  He did say that the larger builders have reduced their stock of speculative homes.  Another director, who is CEO of U.S. Gypsum, thought it would be a couple of months before he had a better idea whether the market had hit bottom.  Furthermore, he thought that, even after the market hits bottom, it would be quite a while before building materials recovered to normal sales levels.  As we were discussing, the subprime situation could be a serious problem for the macroeconomy in a couple of ways.  One would be a major spillover to house prices—it’s too soon to tell about this now, but new spring listings should shed some light by our next meeting.  The other would be significant fallout to other credit market segments, and we don’t see this yet either.  I contacted both GM and Ford, and they said that the subprime mortgages held by their credit subsidiaries had deteriorated, but they had not seen increased defaults in other portions of their portfolios.  Notably, they had not seen any unusual problems in auto loans, and we generally heard this sentiment of a lack of spillover from bankers as well.  On the supply side, given the ample liquidity in financial markets, it seems unlikely that the subprime problem will cause major changes in overall credit availability or pricing. Turning to business investment, none of my contacts reported any major changes in capital spending plans one way or the other.  That said, I did sense that businesses had become a bit more cautious, as David mentioned.  A CEO of a major bank thought that some of this caution was due to the news in the subprime market, but he didn’t think that this was impinging on spending in a meaningful way.  As noted by the head of a major private-equity firm, who is on our board, the recent volatility in financial markets has not significantly altered the availability or terms for financing, even for riskier projects.  Private-equity firms continue to raise large sums, as Janet discussed.  So although I’m more concerned about the outlook, I don’t see the forces in play that would generate a major retrenchment in capital spending.  Inventories are another factor that has weighed on growth recently.  We’ve heard mixed reports from District contacts about how far along they are in the inventory-adjustment process.  In steel, the process seems to be taking longer than expected, but in motor vehicles, both GM and Ford now are generally comfortable with their inventory positions and currently are not planning any major changes in their assembly schedules.  Finally, some sectors of the economy appear to be on good footing.  Healthy labor markets continue to support solid gains in consumer spending, and as Karen discussed, growth abroad continues to support export demand. After balancing all the factors, we marked down our near-term forecast for GDP a bit but retained the basic contours of our previous projection.  The most important difference between our forecast and the Greenbook is that we do not see as much short-term weakness, but the uncertainty surrounding this forecast has increased.  By itself, the change to the growth outlook this round would suggest slightly less inflation risk, but other factors point to continued concern about inflation.  The past couple of readings on consumer prices have been disappointing.  Oil prices are higher than at our last meeting, and unit labor costs accelerated noticeably over the past year.  Furthermore, labor markets remain tight.  So while the benefits of some factors, notably the earlier declines in energy costs, will be transitory, pressures from high labor costs are likely to persist.  Markups remain high enough to absorb some cost increases, but these margins could evaporate quickly, as they did in the late ’90s. In the end, we did not materially change our outlook for inflation.  We continue to project that core PCE prices will increase about 2¼ percent both this year and next.  This inflation rate is too high for my taste, and I think for many of us, and I’m not confident that inflation will moderate adequately as we move into 2009.  One reason for my concern is highlighted in the Bluebook—namely, that the private sector seems to be betting that our inflation objective is 2 percent or higher.  So I continue to think that over the forecast period as a whole the risks to price stability exceed the risks to sustainable growth."
"319";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic picture in our region has changed little since our last meeting.  It seems as though I’ve used that phrase almost every meeting for the past three meetings.  Economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace in our District.  Business contacts expect that pace to continue in the coming months.  According to our March survey, manufacturing activity in our region remained flat, and we’ve seen little change in this activity in the last six months.  The general activity index actually fell from 0.6 in February to 0.2 in March, which are both essentially the same and very close to zero.  But there were some positives to be read from the survey.  First, both the new orders and shipment indexes improved this month.  Second, the diffusion index of capital expenditures, which reflects firms’ planned spending six months from now, moved up to 25 percent—a level that is considerably above the average level of 18 seen over the past two expansions.  Third, other indexes of future activity remain relatively strong.  Finally, in response to a special survey question and ignoring merely seasonal changes in activity, twice as many of our firms said that they expect their own production to accelerate rather than to decelerate in the second quarter compared with the first quarter—46 percent, compared with 23 percent.  I take these as signs that our manufacturers see the soft patch as temporary rather than more prolonged, and this is consistent with the anecdotal evidence gathered in talking to the business contacts in our region.  Thus, business sentiment among our manufacturing firms appears to have changed little since our last meeting. There has been little change not only in overall activity but also in the pattern across sectors.  Housing continues to weaken.  Area homebuilders that we surveyed in February indicate that sales continue to decline, and high inventories continue to hold back construction activity.  Nonresidential real estate markets in the region remain firm, but construction has not gained any appreciable strength.  One of my contacts in a major bank sees continued strong loan demand, however.  Businesses that come to him for loans have strong balance sheets, their profits remain good, and from his perspective that is supportive of continued business investment going forward.  This may be suggesting that business investment, which—as many of us have been concerned about—has been weak in the past several months, may be on the verge of rebounding.  Labor markets in the region remain tight.  Employment in my three states has grown at a pace of 1.3 percent over the past three months ending in January, an acceleration from the 0.8 percent pace over the past twelve months.  The unemployment rate has held steady, and employers continue to complain of difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled labor. On the inflation front, prices for industrial goods continue to move up, but retail price increases have not been widespread.  However, there are signs of increased pressures on wages and salaries.  Wages in low-skilled jobs in New Jersey and Pennsylvania have certainly increased because of increases in state minimum wages, yet the acceleration in wages appears to be more widespread.  Employers in a number of industries have said they had to raise salaries much more this year than they did last year in order to hire and retain workers in certain professional and managerial occupations as well as high-skilled workers in a variety of jobs. In summary, business activity in the region continues to advance at a moderate pace— I’m looking for other words to substitute for “moderate,” which gets old after a while.  Our business contacts expect this moderate pace to be maintained in coming months. Turning to the national economy, at the time of our last meeting, the data on real activity had come in stronger than expected, and inflation, while still elevated, had moved down a bit. Since then, the data suggest perhaps a somewhat weaker near-term growth outlook and a backsliding in my view in the progress on inflation.  If these recent data are indicative of the future, then we are in a much less comfortable position than we thought we were a few weeks ago.  I think there is still good reason to believe that the weakness we are seeing on the real side of the economy remains confined to the effects of the housing correction and to a lesser extent of the auto correction, which should moderate over the year, and that the fundamentals underlying the economy remain somewhat strong.  I think that labor markets will be considerably firmer than in the Greenbook forecast and that the consumer sector will also hold up in part because of that. It’s particularly difficult to infer trends from the data from this past January and February.  A sizable swing in temperatures from one of the warmest Januarys on record to one of the coldest Februarys has led to large swings in both seasonal factors and the economic data more broadly.  So I think that we need to be a little more cautious than usual in trying to interpret these volatile month-to-month numbers.  That said, I must admit that the uncertainty surrounding my own forecast that growth will soon return to trend has increased since our last meeting.  The recent decline in new orders over the past several months suggests that the weakness we’ve seen in business investment in the fourth quarter may linger a little longer than expected, despite healthy business balance sheets and positive investment and business sentiment.  Although in my view the reassessment of risk in the subprime mortgage market suggests that this market is working as it should, the overall weakening in credit conditions in the mortgage market increases uncertainty as to whether the housing correction will be contained or whether it will spill over into other sectors of the economy.  Thus, although I’m not really ready to abandon my forecast, I do think my uncertainty of that forecast has increased somewhat. At the same time, I’m less convinced that inflation is moderating and that we’re making sufficient progress toward price stability.  Perhaps I really should say that I am more concerned that we are not.  The twelve-month change in the core CPI was 2.7 percent, and the three-month change has reaccelerated.  I find the upward trend in core inflation over the past year, from 2 to 2¾ percent, troubling.  I take some comfort in the fact that inflation expectations have moved down somewhat.  Even ten-year expected inflation in our first-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters moved down to 2.35 percent from 2.5 percent.  That’s a seismic event, [laughter] given the stability of that number over the past eight years.  However, these expectations continue to lag, not lead, inflation.  So I remain concerned with the inflation numbers that we are in fact seeing.  Thus, I find myself back to where I was this fall.  A slowdown in real economic activity, if sustained, would suggest a lower equilibrium real rate, but inflation remains elevated. At this point, I would allow for some implicit policy firming implied by a constant fed funds rate unless we see stronger evidence of a declining economy.  Thank you."
"320";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Regarding the small handful of contacts with whom I’ve talked, my trucking industry contact finds things slightly better in February and March, but things had been very, very slow before that.  The company has reduced its truck fleet by 300. My contact says that pricing is flat for the first time in six years; there is a tremendous amount of price competition.  He says that he’s getting four times the usual number of bids.  So the customers are shopping around hard looking for price concessions.  He said things were just marginally better. Both the UPS and FedEx contacts had a similar message—that activity is coming in substantially below what they had anticipated.  The overnight letter business is declining—it is down about 4 percent; the next-day package business is up about 4 percent.  Those are the express products. The net of those is about zero or maybe 1 percent, and they had been expecting something on the order of 3 percent.  So they’re revising down their expectations for this year but apparently not changing their underlying capital investment plans.  However, my UPS contact, in particular, said that they are really scrambling now to reduce outlays.  Essentially, their commitments for expenses are pretty well set in the short run, and so revenue shortfalls go directly to the bottom line. Therefore they are scratching around to reduce expenses.  They are not replacing staff when there’s attrition, and they are cutting out unnecessary travel—all the usual kinds of things.  They have reduced staff, focusing particularly on management positions, which they have reduced by 1,600. I’ve been reflecting on what we make out of the slower-than-expected capital spending, and let me summarize my position this way.  I’m just uneasy about the outlook.  If the Greenbook GDP outlook is wrong, I’m guessing we’re going to come in below it.  I’m mindful, of course, of the standard errors going in both directions and so forth, and we could certainly have upside surprises. I’m just saying that I’m uneasy about that.  I’m also uneasy about the inflation forecast—it could be on the high side or could hang higher—and I worry particularly because it’s the one that produces the most difficult policy situation for us, with output coming in below expectations and inflation hanging above target.  That’s the toughest.  That’s the classic policy dilemma situation.  It causes the most pain.  So that’s the one I concentrate on. It doesn’t seem to me that we’re likely to have a traditional recession.  Money growth remains on the high side.  In the past six months, M2 has been running about 7 percent, and MZM about 8 percent—that doesn’t look like a recession.  If you think about the expansion phase of the cycle, with the exception of housing there were no big imbalances.  We didn’t have the sort of dot- com and telecom over-investment that we had in the late 1990s.  So what might be going on here? Well, it’s clear that businesses have an intense desire to see increasing profits quarter after quarter after quarter; and when you get a revenue slowdown, they go after costs, even if it might not be perhaps long-run profit maximizing, but they feel an intense pressure.  Then you get a Keynesian kind of mechanism in which some people get laid off and some things get delayed and so forth, and that produces some declines in income, and it could lead to a prolonged soft spot in the economy. That’s the kind of process that I think may be under way.  If that’s what’s happening, we’re going to have to be patient and let it work out.  So that’s where I am right now.  Thank you."
"321";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As others have commented, the latest numbers on the performance of the national economy have been mixed, which is to say less positive than I had expected; and I take the Greenbook’s point that growth is subdued this quarter.  I don’t view the recent news on inflation as especially favorable, but I don’t find it overly alarming either.  The question for me is, Do the latest readings have implications for economic performance beyond the current quarter—that is, say, over the next several quarters or so?  At this stage, my answer to that question is “no,” in part because I want to avoid getting whipsawed by marking down the forecast now only to mark it back up in May or June.  More fundamentally, I think that continued gains in employment and income, sound fundamentals for business investment, sustained increases in government spending, and generally liquid financial conditions are likely to maintain the expansion. I also think that the trade situation may turn out to be a bit better than that depicted in the Greenbook, assuming that energy prices don’t take off a lot from here.  I also take some comfort that, at least until now, I haven’t viewed my forecast as especially ebullient.  By the way, I do think that the housing correction still has some way to run, as I’ve commented before, largely because of the overhang of unsold properties. To get some additional evidence on the latest developments, we called a number of our contacts in retailing late last week to see if we could detect anything new in consumer spending. The short answer I would say is “no.”  A clear trend was not apparent from our contacts.  Some reported significant increases in sales recently and were optimistic about prospects.  Some experienced sales decreases and were at the least cautious, and some said sales were unfolding more or less as anticipated.  Overall, this is probably modestly good news, since at least there was no obvious break in consumer outlays.  As for inflation, I would judge that the situation has not changed appreciably, and so I continue to expect modest deceleration over time.  I don’t sense that price pressures are building at this point, but you have to look pretty hard to find convincing signs of moderation as well.  Thank you."
"322";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say at the outset that I believe the moderate-growth scenario is the most likely for 2007.  But as many of you have already discussed, I had thought that business fixed investment particularly was a very real upside opportunity and now consider it a very real downside risk.  The Greenbook marked down BFI over the next couple of quarters, but I think there’s further reason to be concerned about it. Let me confine the rest of my remarks to the market tumult of the past several weeks and give you my views on that, which are broadly consistent with what Bill said at the outset.  First, my sense of what the markets seem to be telling us is that the real economy is weaker.  The first-quarter earnings numbers that Bill showed us very much reflect a trend that we could be seeing more of and that suggests some downside risk in the equity markets that Governor Kohn referred to a moment ago.  A markdown of data in the fourth quarter of 2006, disappointing data regarding business fixed investment, the weakness in the subprime market, and so forth suggest to me that perhaps the markets have been reacting to a U.S. domestic economy that is in somewhat weaker shape than we could have expected even a couple of months ago. What was the cause of the market tumult of the past several weeks?  When markets cannot single out a proximate cause, they have a tendency either to construct one or to be completely dismissive.  In my view, some subset of rather sophisticated investors over the past six months or so have been looking for an opportunity, or maybe I should say an excuse, to pull back from certain markets in which credit-risk spreads have been unusually low; and over the past several weeks, they found one.  There has been a generalized discomfort with markets priced for perfection and levels of volatility that seem uncorrelated with the real world which we’re all trying to analyze.  Many of us have noted in speeches during the past couple of quarters that we have been surprised by the level of certainty implied in market prices, and I think that message is now starting to find its way into the marketplace.  So the tumult and volatility that we’ve seen in the past several weeks will, as it continues, make it more difficult for us to gauge what’s going on. Might this financial market tumult then actually affect the real economy going forward? Generally, I would have said that these financial market activities are quite distinct from the real economy.  But in the case of business fixed investment, I can’t help but believe that the market uncertainty, the talk of recession, the animal spirits that certainly have been negatively affected—all might affect some boards of directors and management teams that are trying to decide about whether to step on the gas on cap-ex or might get them to retreat even further.  Given strong balance sheets, incredibly strong operating cash flows, and all of the momentum that they should have, I’m as puzzled as Tim Geithner as to why we haven’t seen that capital investment.  The tumult in the markets in recent weeks gives me more reason to be concerned there.  Perhaps these management teams are going to find share buybacks to be even more compelling compared with the alternative of capital investment. In general, I took the volatility of the markets at first blush as probably being a proper wake- up call to folks who had gotten perhaps a little too complacent about what was going on, particularly in the credit markets.  Having spent a lot of time in New York in the past several weeks, I think that, if that was a wake-up call, many market participants seem to have hit the snooze button. [Laughter]  Many are reviewing their portfolios and risk positions certainly, and we are seeing a bit more caution.  Perhaps that’s justified by real economic fundamentals or by some lemming phenomenon.  That is, most of these investment banks and other asset managers have in front of them as they’re making decisions a credit-risk button and a client-risk button.  Over the past couple of years, they have always hit the client-risk button—that is, I don’t want to take client risk; I don’t want to lose this business.  So they have hit that button, and the credit markets have been so accommodative and the syndicated markets so strong that they’ve been able to make some free money there.  For a short, short window after February 27, they seem poised to hit the credit-risk button.  One senior credit-risk officer at a major institution told me that he was very popular again. People wanted him in every meeting as they were making underwriting commitments.  He called me back a few days later and said, “No one wants to talk to me again.”  [Laughter]  So I worry whether that wake-up call has actually been felt. Now, could this market volatility of recent weeks spread beyond the subprime market and lead to the kind of credit crunch that would have meaningful downside risks to the economy?  I tried to imagine the circumstances in which that would come.  First, I looked at financial intermediaries, and rather than trying to distinguish between commercial banks and investment banks, hedge funds, and other private equity, I tried to think about them as being creators of credit, distributors of credit, or holders of credit, forgetting all other labels that are associated with them.  Typically, before the rather robust capital markets of the past several years, most of these institutions would decide which of those areas they would be in.   Do they create products and get them off their books, or do they make big bets by deciding what to hold and not?  Many of them have now decided that they could be in all three businesses.  All three businesses were profitable.  To the extent that a portfolio position no longer fit, they could sell it or syndicate it very quickly.  In this new environment, however, with new volatility, these portfolio holdings over time may prove harder to liquidate, and the out-of-the-money options that the creators of structured products have been writing may no longer be free.  A couple of weeks ago, Warren Buffett described one of these financial hedge fund phenomena.  He described the groups as the “innovators, the imitators, and then the swarming masses of incompetents.”  [Laughter]  I won’t describe who is in what category in these markets, but many financial institutions seem to be following one particular premier investment bank that has managed to be a creator of products, to be a syndicator, and to be taking very large principal positions. What happens if these other financial institutions get uncomfortable as these markets tighten, to the extent that they decide that they no longer want to be in the equity bridge business? To cite one example, which President Fisher raised, in a very large, highly leveraged transaction recently, a couple of the investment banks decided to put up a couple billion dollars of capital, and they were short some equity checks.  Typically, they would then go to a series of other banks, bring them into the deal, and then try to syndicate that quickly.  But the first investment banks that were involved wanted to make sure that there was no competition in the syndicated market.  So three non-U.S. financial institutions wrote 1 billion checks for an extremely small fee and agreed to hold that billion dollars of equity on their own balance sheets for a term of not less than 365 days and to syndicate it later only to those who would be satisfactory to the lead investment banks.  To what extent over the next twelve months will they and others feel uncomfortable in this new business environment with that kind of equity exposure?  If that process ends up being disorderly, there could be a rapid turn to risk aversion.  Of course, I think the more likely case is that this is orderly and supportive of sustainable growth, but that’s the financial situation in which I would get very nervous very quickly. I think a second mechanism by which the situation could become worse involves a whole set of legal risks around the subprime markets and uncertainty generally over where liability rests. Through the good intentions of policymakers in the Congress and in state legislatures, some uncertainty could be introduced into the foreclosure market and into the syndication markets. Many enterprising state attorneys general seem poised to do just the same, and that kind of legal risk could be very dangerous for these credit markets. Finally, what does that situation mean for us?  I suspect that, besides our needing to keep a focus on these financial markets, it is what’s happening in the real economy.  As we’ll discuss a bit more tomorrow, our statement should be and will necessarily be read in the context of our reaction to incoming real data as opposed to our reaction to what’s happening in the financial markets. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"323";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  Perhaps unlike in the rest of the country, most of the recent cyclical data point to some reasons for optimism about near-term growth in New England, with the possible exception of the rate of foreclosure initiations related to subprime mortgages.  The annual benchmark revisions by the BLS paint a happier picture of the current state of regional job growth, especially in Massachusetts and Connecticut.  The overall message is that the region has been growing at a pace that is about at its long-term trend and has been adding jobs consistently in recent months.  This picture is a bit different from the one we’ve been seeing for some time. The region’s unemployment rate remains about at the nation’s, and demand for skilled labor, as measured by both online and newspaper help-wanted ads and by anecdotal reports, is quite strong.  Indeed, many continue to note that hiring the skilled workers they need has been difficult.  Both temporary-help service firms and software and IT firms report strong demand for labor, particularly to meet finance and technical positions and to meet a growing backlog in activity in high-tech businesses.  This aspect of the region’s labor market may be pulling some discouraged workers back into the labor force, as reflected in the perhaps temporary uptick in unemployment.  Reflecting this better news on regional job growth, the Philadelphia Fed’s coincident economic indexes point to economic activity in the region’s two largest states that is on a par with national growth.  When we surveyed a wide swath of retail contacts, we saw a bit of gloom on the retail side.  But the fact that in New England you have an array of very small companies, sometimes in unique circumstances, may have given a little downbeat sense to the retail climate.  The reports from larger retailers in the survey—and we have a couple of them— show solid year-over-year growth.  Manufacturing employment continued to decline, but manufactured exports last quarter rose at a pace just a bit slower than the nation’s and were buoyed by airline-related products, fabricated metals, and general machinery.  As I’ve noted before, downtown vacancy rates in most of the cities in New England are declining, as are suburban office vacancies; rents are rising; and one or two corridors fanning out from Boston are reportedly hot sites for new biotech firm locations.  Business confidence, as measured by local surveys, is up, as is consumer confidence.  So, overall, things are not too bad. A concern among this mostly brighter news is the rising rate of initiations of real estate foreclosures, especially those related to properties financed with subprime adjustable-rate mortgages.  According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, whether one looks at the rate of total foreclosures or at the pace of foreclosures among just subprime mortgages, initiations have risen rapidly in New England from a very low base and now outstrip the nation’s.  This is not a contest you want to win.  Anecdotes abound about individual borrowers lured into what appear to be quite inappropriate mortgages, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been working with local bankers’ associations and the Massachusetts Banking Department and others on outreach and education.  Why New England generally, and Massachusetts specifically, should be outstripping the nation in this area isn’t really clear.  The local banking industry does not appear to have played much of a role in subprime lending, nor were we an area of bubble-like real estate growth, though clearly prices rose rapidly in the region over a fairly long time.  The detrimental effects to local communities from the rise in foreclosures and the potential for negative political fallout—not unlike what President Lacker mentioned—seem obvious. On the national scene, the incoming data on the real economy, with the possible exception of job growth, have been slower than I expected.  Inflation data, if anything, have been higher.  The picture is not comforting, and it is complicated by questions related both to the housing market and the surprisingly slow pace of business spending.  Many people around the table have mentioned both those things.  The degree of national fallout from problems in subprime mortgage lending is a question right now, as it bears both on the pace of recovery in residential real estate investment and on the potential for wider spillovers from housing to consumption.  At present, we in Boston, like the Greenbook authors, don’t expect that subprime mortgage problems will by themselves have much of an effect on overall growth.  But we do have a concern if these problems lead to tighter lending standards, making mortgages and other borrowing more difficult to obtain and thereby exacerbate housing inventory overhangs, extend the current period of sluggish new home starts, and create further downward pressure on home prices.  So far, we don’t see much of that happening.  Trends in overall market and banking liquidity, mortgage interest rates, and new mortgage issuance are all positive.  We think that those trends, combined with positive consumer home-buying attitudes, paint a reassuring picture that some of the downward trends will not be as severe as they otherwise might be.  Indeed, I spoke to members of the advisory board of Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies in late February.  The group was composed of about fifty major homebuilders and major suppliers to the building industry.  They were in a bit of collective shock regarding the rapid deterioration that they saw in their industry from late last year into the current quarter and seemed to be focused on inventory and cost control rather than on profits this year, which they didn’t expect. However, they saw continuing spending on home improvement, growth from commercial construction, and strength in non-U.S. markets as partial offsets.  No one in the group mentioned the subprime issue or potential problems in mortgage financing, but that may have just been the fact of the moment.  It was actually the day before the market break in late February, so it’s possible that they are not thinking along the same lines today. We have also been asking ourselves why business fixed investment has been so slow relative to fundamentals.  We had been assuming that this inexplicable trend would right itself and that growth of producers’ durable equipment would show greater signs of health, but that hasn’t happened.  We, like the Greenbook, have written down expectations regarding PDE.  I’d really like to be wrong on the downside regarding this area, as it worries me a bit more than subprime mortgages or any of the recent financial market ups and downs.  If businesses lack the confidence to invest in new equipment as much as they might be expected to given the fundamentals, how much longer will they continue to hire staff?  If job growth slows, what will happen to consumption?  To date, both hiring and consumption remain pretty solid.  But while I saw some upside risks here at our last meeting, now I’m a little worried on the downside.  In view of the incoming data, we have written down our forecast, much as the Greenbook has, and we have joined the Greenbook in a lower estimate of potential.  We see growth a bit above 2 percent this year, rising to the mid 2s in ’08, with slightly rising unemployment and only slightly slowing core PCE inflation. However, as I probably implied before, I think the risks around this forecast on both sides seem to have risen.  Will housing trends and the possible effects of diminished business spending affect the resilient consumer more than we now expect?  Will the underlying pattern of core inflation continue to surprise on the upside, with the moderation we expect remaining mostly in the forecast?  I don’t mean to overreact here.  There are positives.  External growth is strong. Fiscal spending at both the state and the national levels should be supportive.  Financial markets, though certainly a bit more volatile and nervous, remain accommodative.  Perhaps the downside risks to growth that I see are simply the ebb and flow of the U.S. economy continuing its transition from an above-trend rate of expansion just a year ago, not unlike the slow patch we saw in the late summer and early fall of last year.  All in all, I remain somewhat more concerned about risks on the inflation side than about risks to growth.  But it does seem to me as though the balancing act in meeting our two objectives has gotten a bit more difficult.,   We have done quite a bit of work with the Banking Department of the State of Massachusetts and with the Massachusetts Bankers Association.  We have had meetings with those two groups in many of the affected areas around Massachusetts, basically looking to provide education.  We’ve done some materials on the education side.  Obviously, once you’re in the midst of a foreclosure, education isn’t all that helpful.  The Banking Department has been trying to bring along local lenders to see what they can do to create a refinancing situation for borrowers.  We’re not part of that particular conversation, but we have been part of the outreach that the Banking Department has been making.,   I think we recently forwarded some information to Governor Kroszner about this.,   No, no, no—I know that.  [Laughter]   I think we did it by e-mail, and someone in your Community Affairs area may be in the process of passing it along.,   But I have a copy of the e-mail in my Blackberry.,   I wondered about that.  Don didn’t get one yesterday."
"324";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Comments from my business contacts confirm the softening in economic activity that is depicted in the Greenbook.  Most of the people I talked with during this intermeeting period confirmed the slowing that we are seeing in the national data.  But at the same time, they expect that business will improve over this year.  My business contacts are still planning to add modestly to staff and to expand output, although their capital spending plans are not particularly ambitious this year.  A number of my business contacts told me that the dollar depreciation is finally having an effect.  They are getting more orders and are being asked to quote more jobs from foreign customers. I have recently had conversations with CEOs of the large banks from my District, who have an interesting perspective on the ongoing turmoil in the subprime mortgage market.  They don’t seem to be particularly concerned that the situation in the mortgage markets is going to be substantially worse than is already factored into the admittedly weak housing forecast.  But they are concerned, as President Yellen mentioned in her comments earlier, that the subprime mortgage problems are symptomatic of broader issues that could spill over into hedge funds and private-equity funds—both of which have become an increasingly important source of funding for business investment activity.  They worry that retrenching among managers of these funds could adversely affect business confidence more generally.  Their comments resemble the alternative Greenbook scenario labeled “Business Pessimism with Spillovers.”  The difference, however, is that my business contacts are suggesting that the problems could originate in the financial sector and spill over to producers’ expectations. Turning to inflation, the volatility in the monthly retail price numbers, even in the so- called core measures, will make it difficult to clearly perceive the very modest progress in the inflation trend that appears in the Greenbook baseline.  Given the usual noise in the price data, work by my research department indicates that identifying a break in the inflation trend on the order of about ½ percentage point with a fair amount of certainty can take somewhere between a year and a half and two years after the break has in fact occurred.  While I believe we are still on a course that leads to a lower inflation trend, the path we take to get there will not likely be a smooth one, and there will be times that will test our nerve.  Indeed, as I look at the data today, I would judge that the downside risk to the real economy has increased somewhat.  Still, in my view the primary risk we face is that inflation could remain stuck higher than either I or the Greenbook foresee.  Under these conditions, I think two qualities are essential—patience and clarity.  We need to be patient so that we don’t become unnecessarily aggressive in trying to foster lower inflation in a softening economic environment, and we need clarity so that the public does not come to see our patience as indifference to the current inflation trend.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"325";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent data on economic activity have been downbeat in many sectors, and I agree with the general tenor of the Greenbook that the near-term outlook is weaker than before.  Indeed, we have cut expected growth this year almost ½ percentage point, to 2¼ percent.  This pace of growth is substantially below potential, and we expect the unemployment rate to start to edge up fairly quickly.  Even relative to this lower baseline, I think the downside risks to the prospects for output growth have sharpened in the intermeeting period.  I’m especially concerned about two risks—broader retrenchment in financial markets along the lines that we’re seeing in the subprime mortgage market and a further hesitation and faltering of capital spending. As we discussed in detail two years ago, an asset price bubble inevitably leads to unsustainable imbalances in the economy and a misallocation of resources.  The extraordinary run-up in house prices in recent years led to construction and sales booms that couldn’t last.  So far the adjustments to more-sustainable levels of housing starts and sales have been relatively orderly.  However, there is still an overhang of precarious financing from the past relaxed mortgage-lending standards that has to be eliminated.  For example, in 2005 and 2006 something like 40 percent of first-time homebuyers put no money down with their purchase.  The market is beginning to recognize the size of this overhang and, with the recent deterioration in the performance of subprime mortgages, is dramatically reassessing mortgage risk.  Going forward, we will have to closely monitor increases in mortgage-risk compensation and tightening of credit standards.  Such changes, especially if they go too fast or too far, could amplify the housing- sector decline as has been recognized, pushing housing prices and activity down, and with spillovers to consumer spending, they could prove to be a substantial drag on the overall economy. Despite the recent turmoil in equity and mortgage markets, a reassessment of overall risk has yet to occur.  We are still in an environment of low long-term yields, ample liquidity, and what appears to be a generally low level of compensation for risk.  For example, I recently talked with the principals of several major private-equity funds, who were not just amazed but also appalled about the amount of money their industry has attracted.  [Laughter]  One partner said that he would have no difficulty immediately raising 1 billion.  Indeed, one of his biggest problems is would-be investors who get angry at him because he is unwilling to take their money.  This unwillingness reflects his difficulty in identifying deals that are likely to yield adequate returns even though, for the buyout firms, debt also is available in what they depict as very attractive so-called covenant-lite terms—perhaps too attractive given the vulnerability of some of the highly leveraged yields.  My contacts suggest that some private-equity firms with similar assessments of the shortage of profit opportunities are less restrained and do take additional money, partly because of the large upfront fees that are generated by these deals.  So just as we have seen in mortgage markets, the bubble in private equity, as my sources characterize it, and the overabundance of liquidity more generally raise the risk of a sharp retrenchment in credit and higher risk spreads with associated risks to economic growth and, conceivably, even financial stability. A second, related risk concerns investment spending.  It’s surprising that, despite the ample financing available, firms have still been reluctant to ramp up their capital spending. Certainly, any precipitous tightening of financing could curtail investment.  However, as noted in one of the Greenbook alternative simulations, greater business pessimism about future returns to new capital is also a significant risk.  The recent pullback in orders and shipments for capital goods has persisted and deepened more than any of us had anticipated.  Even for high-tech spending, which continues to expand, my contacts on the manufacturing side are not very optimistic.  Sales of PCs and related equipment were mildly disappointing in 2006, and our contacts don’t see the introduction of the Microsoft Vista operating system in January as having generated much enthusiasm among businesses. Turning to inflation, our outlook for core inflation, like that of the Greenbook, has changed little since January.  I continue to anticipate gradually moderating inflation with core PCE price inflation edging down from 2¼ percent in 2006 to 2 percent this year.  There are certainly clear upside risks to this forecast, especially given the resumption of increases in energy prices.  These risks remain despite some weakening in the outlook for real activity.  In principle, the anticipated subpar growth should help relieve inflationary pressures.  However, we remain very uncertain about what par is.  The continued low unemployment rate, coupled with recent sluggish output growth, suggests via Okun’s law that potential output could be growing in the vicinity of 2¼ percent.  If, contrary to our assumption, that were the case, any labor market tightness now boosting inflation might not diminish this year. More-favorable news is found in recent survey evidence on inflation expectations.  As many of you have commented in past meetings, inflation expectations are perhaps more influential to the inflation outlook than is the unemployment rate.  Their relative stability over the past several years has probably been a key factor restraining the rise in inflation over the past two years.  However, what has not generally been noted is the importance of near-term inflation expectations, those with a forecast horizon of a year or two.  Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that these near-term inflation expectations are as important as long-run expectations for determining inflation dynamics.  The latest Blue Chip and Professional Forecasters surveys both show expectations of core inflation edging down next year.  For example, the SPF shows core PCE inflation dropping to 2 percent next year, exactly in line with our own forecast.  I also see the general downward tilt in inflation expectations over the next couple of years as contributing to a favorable inflation prognosis."
"326";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070321meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our view of the outlook has changed since our last meeting, but more in the balance of risks and the sources of uncertainty than in our actual forecast for growth.  But just to go through the changes quickly, we’ve reduced our forecast for growth in ’07 a bit, to something less than 3 percent, and we see more downside risks to that forecast.  We’ve moved up the expected path of core PCE inflation just a bit in light of recent numbers, but we have maintained essentially the same view as before—that inflation will moderate to around 2 percent by the end of this year and a bit below that in ’08.  We see the risk to this forecast still to the upside.  We face greater uncertainty about the near-term outlook than we have over the past few meetings.  Looking to the medium term, although we haven’t yet reduced our estimate of potential growth, we’re a bit more concerned than we’ve been about the strength of underlying structural productivity growth going forward.  We have also changed our view of the appropriate path of policy a bit, introducing a gentle move down now in the fed funds rate beginning around the middle of the year.  So this puts us a bit below the assumed path in the Greenbook, but we assume a slower, smaller reduction in the nominal fed funds rate than the market does today.  Our forecast is quite close to that of the staff’s in the Greenbook, and the basic story is similar.  Our differences are the same as they have been for some time—we have slightly more growth and slightly lower inflation.  That reflects things we talked about before, different views about information dynamics and about potential growth.  Our view of the output gap and its evolution, however, is similar. I have just a few points on some issues.  On the growth front, the recent numbers suggest both a deeper adjustment in housing and a broader weakness in the economy than we anticipated, notably in capital goods orders.  The effect of these developments on our forecast is not that large, however.  Their significance is more in the risk to the outlook and the uncertainty, the puzzle that the investment weakness presents for the medium term.  On housing and consumption, the probability of the dark scenario is still small, but it is higher than it has been and deserves some attention.  The dark scenario is the risk that the reduction in credit to the household sector amplifies the decline in housing demand, which leads to a greater adjustment in prices, with a risk of a more- pronounced, prolonged decline in growth and spending.  Monetary policy should not be directed at trying to put a floor on housing demand or on prices, only at limiting the risk that the weakness accumulates substantially or spreads to overall demand.  Regarding capital spending, we just don’t have a good explanation for why—with margins that are still pretty good, reasonable earnings growth, solid growth in aggregate demand here and globally, relatively low interest rates, and reasonable levels of business confidence—spending has continued to come in well below our expectations.  This series of disappointments, of course, has been going on for some time; it’s not just about the latest numbers for durable goods orders.  Perhaps this situation will prove transitory, but it justifies a bit more caution to the outlook.  Of these two risks—in housing and in investment—I’d say the latter matters more and is potentially more consequential.  But both of these effects are offset, in our basic view, by the expected strength in personal income growth going forward, by what are still fairly favorable overall financial conditions, and by fairly robust external demand. Regarding productivity, productivity growth per quarter at an annualized rate has, over the past ten quarters, come in significantly below 2 percent, kind of close to the estimates of the trend rate for the period between ’73 and ’95.  Some of the analysts who spend a lot of time thinking about this are starting to lose conviction that trend growth is still in the neighborhood of 2½ percent for the nonfarm business sector.  We’re still viewing the recent weakness as transitory or cyclical, but the risk that trend growth is below our estimate is, I think, increasing. On inflation, despite the higher recent numbers, not much has really changed in our view. We still expect core PCE to move to below 2 percent over the forecast period, and we still see the risk as not getting quite that moderation.  The sources of the recent negative surprises in the core data, which seem concentrated in medical services, probably don’t say much about monetary policy or broader inflation dynamics, and inflation expectations remain stable at reasonable levels.  So our view of the growth outlook has changed a bit, but our view of the inflation outlook hasn’t changed much based on these numbers. On the markets, as many people have said and as Bill discussed at the beginning, I don’t see much that’s been troubling thus far.  Although correlations across asset markets have risen, overall liquidity seems fine.  There’s been very limited contagion from mortgages into other credit markets. Debt issuance seems to be continuing.  People are able to raise money to finance corporate restructuring investment.  There is very little concern, I think, about substantial losses, on the basis of what’s happened to date, in the core of the financial system and very limited evidence of stress among the various funds.  But it’s still early in some ways, and the fundamental outlook for growth is a bit weaker and more uncertain.  Risk premiums, credit spreads, and volatility still look potentially vulnerable to a more substantial reversal.  The weakness in the subprime market will take some time to work through the full range of securities issued against pools of collateral that include mortgages.  The complexity in valuing structured mortgage products, the difficulty in designing hedges that actually work against exposure to that risk, and uncertainty about the shape of the adverse tail and that part of the credit spectrum are all conditions that apply to a range of other structured credit markets and credit products.  In the debate about the implications of this prolonged yield-curve inversion, we have tended to side with those who have found comfort in the contrary signal you see in lower levels of risk premiums and credit spreads.  Yet it’s possible that the forces that may have been holding down forward rates are also holding down credit spreads and holding up the value of other assets and, therefore, may be masking weakness in the economy rather than masking strength. On balance, although the outlook still looks fundamentally positive, we see a more complicated and less benign set of risks to the outlook, more downside risks to growth, and some continued concern that we won’t get enough moderation in inflation.  To us, this outlook justifies a stance of policy with a path for the fed funds rate somewhat above what is now priced into the markets.  This doesn’t mean, in our view, that we need to signal that nominal rates going forward are more likely to rise than to fall from current levels; it means only that we should convey the sense that our view of the most likely evolution of policy still implies a higher path than is now priced into the markets.  We can afford to be patient before adjusting policy, as Sandy said, but we need to have as much flexibility as possible going forward.  This suggests that we acknowledge that the overall balance of risks has shifted a bit toward neutral, toward a flat stance of policy, but not all the way there.  A delicate task for us is to do this without inducing a reaction in the market that pulls forward significantly more easing than has already occurred."
"327";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Vincent.  I have penciled in some time after the policy decision for discussion and comments about the process and for the head of the subcommittee to talk a little about what we will be doing in our communication discussions going forward.  So in the interest of time, I would ask people who have questions for Vincent to try to restrict them primarily to the projections themselves and to the economic outlook, if that is okay. Does anyone have any questions for Vincent?  If not, we can begin our go-round.  President Yellen.,   Thank you.  President Moskow.,   Thank you.  President Fisher.,   Thank you.

Governor Kohn.,   They’re always more uncertain than usual.  [Laughter],   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you.  Let me try to summarize the discussion around the table and take any comments on the summary, and then I would like to add just a few thoughts. Broadly speaking, the outlook of most participants has not substantially changed since March. Housing remains weak, and it is the greatest source of downside risk.  Whether the demand for housing has stabilized remains difficult to judge, in part because of subprime issues.  It is also unclear whether builders will seek to return inventories to historical levels, and if so, at what rate. There is yet no indication of significant spillover from housing to other sectors, although that remains a risk.  The downside risks to investment have moderated since the last meeting, although investment seems unlikely to be a strong driver of growth.  The inventory cycle is now well advanced, and production is strengthening.  Consumption growth seems likely to moderate, reflecting factors such as weakness in house prices and high energy prices.  However, the labor market remains strong, particularly in the market for highly skilled workers.  Incomes generated by the labor market, together with gains in the stock market and generally accommodative financial conditions, should provide some support for consumption going forward.  Financial markets are priced for perfection, which implies some risks on that score.  Foreign economies remain strong and should be a source of support, although some are undertaking monetary tightening.  Overall, the economy is in a soft patch and will likely grow below trend for a while.  Growth should return to potential later this year or in 2008, depending on the evolution of the housing market.  The rate of potential growth remains hard to pin down.  Several participants seem a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook on potential growth and the NAIRU, although there are risks. Inflation has improved a bit, and most see continued but very slow moderation.  However, there are upside risks to inflation, including compensation, the dollar, energy prices, and a slowing in productivity.  Moreover, a rise in inflation from current levels would be costly, particularly if it involved unhinging inflation expectations.  Vigilance on inflation must, therefore, be maintained. Overall the risks and uncertainties seem a bit less pronounced than at the last meeting, and participants seemed relatively comfortable with the outlook.  Although there are some potentially significant downside risks to output, arising particularly from the housing sector and the possible spillover to consumption, the group still appears to view a failure of inflation to moderate as expected to be the predominant risk to longer-term stability.  Are there any comments or questions? Hearing none, I will just add a few points.  First, following President Yellen, I think that the tension between slow growth and a strong labor market remains central to understanding what’s going on.  Okun’s law is supposed to work better than this.  [Laughter]  I looked at recent history. Over the past twenty years or so, there has been no exact parallel to what we are seeing now.  There was a jobless recovery in ’91-’93 in which unemployment remained high even though growth was picking up, and we had a midcycle slowdown in ’95 and ’96, which was relatively short and not very severe, in which the unemployment rate got temporarily ahead of growth.  So there have been some deviations.  Interestingly, after the 2001 recession, despite lots of talk about jobless recoveries, Okun’s law worked pretty well.  So we are in an unusual situation—instead of a jobless recovery, we have growthless job growth.  [Laughter] Interpreting this correctly is very important.  The staff forecast essentially assumes that Okun’s law will revert to historical tendency.  I think that assumption is reasonable, particularly since the staff is not exceptionally optimistic about potential growth and, therefore, that particular source of error is moderated.  That would suggest that labor hoarding is probably a good part of what is happening here.  If there is one area in which labor hoarding appears to be significant, it would be construction, as President Yellen mentioned.  I asked the staff to do a simple study of this relationship, to which Dave Stockton referred.  Andrew Figura and Adam Looney of the Board’s staff performed a regression analysis in which they regressed all construction employment against all investment in structures quarterly with lags going back to 1985.  The reason to look at all construction in terms of both employment and production is that there is a lot of substitutability between those two categories.  That regression approach should also account for unmeasured labor, including undocumented workers and the like.  In this analysis they found that employment is roughly proportional to construction activity, but with substantial lags, which again is somewhat surprising.  Indeed, the model fits well through the fourth quarter of ’06 but then begins to underpredict significantly in the first quarter of ’07.  If this model is correct, then given what is already in the pipeline in terms of reduced construction activity and then going on with the forecast in the Greenbook, we should begin to see fairly significant declines in construction employment on the order of 30,000 per month over the next year, which would be sufficient in itself, with all else being equal, to add 0.2 to 0.3 to the unemployment rate.  So if labor hoarding explains the failure of Okun’s law, then we may soon see some gradual rise in the unemployment rate, which would also be consistent with the view that the staff has taken that a good bit of the slowdown in productivity is cyclical. It is actually fairly difficult to calculate the contribution of the construction sector to productivity because it involves not just construction workers but also upstream production of various kinds.  But one estimate, which comes from discussions with the Council of Economic Advisers, had the implication of employment hoarding in construction being about ½ percentage point on productivity growth.  We will see how that develops.  Even though I believe, as does the staff, that we will see some softening in the labor market, I should say that the evidence is still quite tentative.  We saw a bit of weakness in the last labor report, but unemployment insurance claims remain low, and we do not really see a significant indication. The other major issue is the housing market.  Again, as a number of people pointed out, this is an inventory-cycle problem.  The two main determinants of an inventory cycle are (1) what the level of final demand is and (2) how quickly you move to bring inventories back to normal.  There does seem to have been some step-down in final demand over the past few months.  Assuming that homebuilders would like to get not all the way to but significantly toward their last ten years’ inventories by the end of 2008 implies fairly weak construction, not only in the second quarter but going into the third quarter as well.  Only in the fourth quarter will we see a relatively minor subtraction from GDP.  That’s also relatively speculative, but residential construction does seem fairly likely to me to be more of a drag than we previously thought and to continue to be a problem into the third quarter. There will also be a slowdown in consumption.  We have been having rates near 4 percent, which is certainly not sustainable.  We already see indications that consumption may be closer to 2 percent in the second quarter.  I think the house-price effects are going to show up.  Gasoline prices will have an effect.  The labor market is strong, but it is going to slow a bit.  So it looks to me as though underlying growth is roughly 2 percent and will be so for a couple of quarters to come. Notice in the thinking about the underlying case that there has been quite an asynchronicity between private domestic final demand and production lately.  For example, for the second quarter we expect to see weaker private domestic final demand but probably a stronger GDP number because of rebounds in net exports and the like.  But we should look past that—those are just quarter-to-quarter variations—and observe that growth is moderate, an observation that is supported by the sense that industrial production and manufacturing seem to be picking up.  To summarize, I think that the notion of moderate growth with some uncertainty and with return toward potential later in the year or early next year is still probably about the right forecast. On inflation, there’s the famous stock market prediction that prices will fluctuate.  That seems to be true also for inflation.  I mentioned at the last meeting that the monthly standard deviation in inflation numbers is about 0.08, and so between 0.1 and 0.3 there is not necessarily a whole lot of information.  We have a few pieces of good news.  I think vacancy rates are rising for both apartments and single-family homes.  At some point we will begin to see better progress on owners’ equivalent rent and shelter costs.  Also, the quarterly average of medical cost increases was much more moderate than in the first two months, which suggests that maybe this risk is not as serious as it may have looked.  However, as many people pointed out, there are a number of negatives, including the dollar, energy, food prices, commodity prices, and most importantly, the labor market.  The compensation data remain quite mixed—in particular, the ECI, which was a very soft headline number.  The 1.1 percent quarterly wage and salary number, or 3.6 percent for twelve months, is now more or less consistent with what we’re seeing in average hourly earnings.  If productivity falls below 2 percent, then we are beginning to get to a range in which unit labor costs will be putting pressure on inflation.  So I am quite comfortable with the view expressed around the table that, although inflation looks to be stabilizing and perhaps falling slowly, there are significant risks to inflation and we should take those very seriously. Very much a side point—I did have some interesting discussions with the staff about the role of the stock market in the forecast.  This is not the staff’s fault, but there is a sort of tension in how the stock market is treated.  On the one hand, the stock market is assumed to grow at 6½ percent from the current level.  On the other hand, the forecast has profit growth going essentially to zero by the third quarter but interest rates coming up.  Those two things are a little hard to reconcile. The difficult problem is which way you should go to reconcile it.  On the one hand, it could be that the forecast is right, and therefore the stock market will in fact be weaker; that will have implications for stability, for consumption, and so on.  On the other hand, perhaps we should be taking information from the stock market in making our forecast.  So it is a very difficult problem, and I just wanted to point out the tension that we will have to see resolved over the next few quarters.  One partial resolution is that, as has been noted, the stock market and the economy as a whole can be decoupled to some extent because of overseas profits.  This is an interesting example of how financial globalization is creating stability for domestic consumption—you know, decoupling domestic consumption from domestic production.  Again, we had a very good discussion with the staff about this issue, and I think it is just something we will need to think about going forward. In summary, in the last meeting we felt that uncertainty had risen.  There has been perhaps a slight moderation of those concerns at this point—a little less inflation risk, a little less growth risk. Nevertheless, the balance of risks with inflation being the greater still seems to me to be a reasonable approach.  Let me now turn to Vincent to begin the policy go-round."
"328";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, last time I reported a sense that the international economy was hot, that our domestic economy was cold, and that the regional economy of the Eleventh District was just about right.  I concluded my comments by saying that we were in treacherous waters in terms of the U.S. economy, navigating between the Scylla of inflation and the Charybdis of a slowdown in growth.  Like President Yellen, I don’t have much change to report, but I do want to comment in very brief order on a couple of aspects that my two predecessors commented on. As far as the international economy is concerned, we see continued expectations for higher growth and a different mindset beginning to set in.  You saw that, I believe, in the French elections. Even Italian consumer and business confidence is at a ten-year high, or six-year high depending on which measurement you use.  You also see it reflected in various measures of port congestion, charter rates for ships, and profit contributions to U.S. multinationals.  By the way, the contacts that we talk to, Bill, are making a real effort to ferret it out and have a sense that there should be more push or oomph from abroad than they are getting domestically.  You still have to prune those reports carefully.  You see it in commodity prices.  The bottom line from the standpoint of the Dallas Fed is that we’re seeing a tightening of capacity utilization in the rest of the world, which is somewhat vexing for U.S. operators because it limits our firms’ abilities to cut costs by shipping production abroad.  Nonetheless, the rest of the world economy remains hot. I have just a couple of comments about the United States.  When I talk to the rails, the airlines, the express delivery logistic companies, the middle-income consumption sectors such as retailers, or those that sell into those sectors, I am hearing increasing reports of weaker demand and lower expectations than I was hearing at the last meeting in all but one sector, which is the entertainment sector.  Advertising revenues for the networks continue to stay high, and by the way, visits to theme parks are at a record high, driven largely by wealthy foreigners who are finding them to be a tremendous bargain.  On the housing front, I have been bearish—more bearish than anybody at this table.  I remain so, and like President Yellen and, I believe, President Moskow, I am more concerned than I was before.  We can go through the numbers, but I think it is best expressed by the CEO of one of the five big builders, who said that in March he was arguing internally with his board that the headlines were worse than reality and now reality is worse than the headlines.  There is significant inventory, and the qualification of buyers is becoming a very vexing issue.  I suspect that this situation has yet to run its course.  I am also hearing continued reports, despite layoffs and a slowing economy, of continued tightness of highly skilled labor and continued price pressure on that front.  Finally in terms of the domestic economy, we are benefiting from a weaker dollar in terms of tourism flows and also the high-end retailers, most of which are in President Geithner’s District and one—Neiman Marcus—in my own District.  Other than that, I have nothing to add on the U.S. economy. I want to talk about inflation for a minute.  The data—whether core PCE or overall, core CPI, or even the trimmed mean, which we focus on in Dallas—seem to be indicating a tempering of pressures.  So we have some meat on the bones of our expectation, or I should say our hope, that some deceleration of inflation pressures would manifest itself.  But in talking to my business contacts, I would say—if you will forgive a terrible reversal of biblical scripture—that, though the flesh may be willing, the spirit is weak.  What I mean is that even though they would like to believe the numbers, in terms of their own behavioral patterns and the way they are positioning their management, they feel enormous threats to their margins coming from slow volume growth and coming from increasing cost pressures in that they allocate tasks globally.  And their first reaction is to see how they could change the pricing structure domestically.  Chemicals are reporting that a 3 to 5 percent price action that was taken at the beginning of the year is sticking.  My contact from a large producer of food products said that they are shifting their overall model away from focusing on unit-volume expansion to pricing, and even a ubiquitous brand like Starbucks is moving away from the number of transactions to figure out how to price more aggressively or to restructure the size of their containers, as are many food product producers.  The large consumer paper products reported that they were budgeting zero percent price inflation at the beginning of the year and have redone their budget to price at 3 to 4 percent.  If I had to pick a word, Mr. Chairman, in terms of the mood of our companies regarding the U.S. economy, I would say that it’s somewhat dyspeptic.  It’s not a very pleasant mood.  They feel a little indigestion because of the margin pressure that they’re getting and limited relief in terms of what they’re able to pull out in volume expansion. I am in an unusual position of coming from what I believe, reading the Beige Book and looking at the data, is a District that continues to significantly outperform the rest of the economy, although we have slowed somewhat; yet when you look at the histograms, I have the lowest forecast for GDP for this year.  So I am the most pessimistic at the table in terms of short-term economic growth, and on the inflation front I would just resort to a Ronald Reaganism, which is that we need to trust but verify.  In short, I would not be surprised to see disappointing growth in the second quarter, much more disappointing than in the Greenbook’s forecast, nor would I be surprised to see higher core PCE inflation sustaining itself than I am hearing from some of my colleagues and from the staff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"329";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I gave a fairly detailed summary of the District’s economy last time, and it hasn’t changed a great deal since then.  So I’ll be fairly brief. The labor markets in the region remain fairly tight; they have not loosened at all since our last meeting.  Our manufacturing sector continues to show strength.  Our agricultural sector continues to show strength.  Housing is the one area that, as in other parts of the country, has shown weakness as inventories have built; but we haven’t seen dramatic declines in prices at this point, and we will watch that, as others are watching it within their regions. On the national outlook, we see that the economy will continue to grow at something below trend.  We’re a little more optimistic than the Greenbook, but the point is that we should see the economy grow below trend.  For all the reasons that others have said, we expect inflation to moderate, but reasonably slowly, over the next eighteen months.  Therefore, anticipating the next discussion, I would say that, as a policy group, we need to be resolute in our own policies in terms of holding our positions fairly firm.  So I’ll leave it at that until we get to the policy discussion, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you."
"330";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook, like most of the rest of yours, was basically the same as the one in the Greenbook, and it hasn’t changed all that much over the past few weeks.  Like the rest of you, I see income growing at less than the growth rate of potential for several quarters, the pace held down by housing and the slower growth of consumption that has become evident in recent data and confirmed by President Poole’s reports.  This is offset over time by a strengthening of business spending, the end to the inventory correction that we see in IP and ISM statements, and a pickup in capital expenditures as businesses feel more comfortable that the expansion will continue and that any overbuilding they did when income growth was higher in those three or four years that President Stern was talking about has been absorbed.  Like the rest of you, I see a pickup in demand to something like the growth rate of potential some time next year as housing activity adjusts to the lower level of demand and as inventory is worked off.  Several favorable factors support this eventual return to potential: supportive financial conditions, especially for businesses; credit availability, which we’ve just been talking about; narrow credit spreads; low long-term rates; and good foreign demand— another upward adjustment in this Greenbook to rest-of-the-world economic growth; and the decline in the dollar—which will support exports.  I used the staff structural growth of 2½ percent.  It seemed to me that the adjustments the staff made were small, offsetting in participation and productivity, and looked reasonable given the recent data.  There is still a tension between the labor data and having potential growth as high as it is, and it leaves the staff in a position in which labor force participation is slightly above the trend, which strikes me as where it ought to be when the unemployment rate is slightly below the NAIRU.  Also, productivity is slightly below the trend, so they need faster-than-trend productivity growth just to get back to their now lower trend, which strikes me as where it ought to be after three or four quarters of below-trend growth and presumably some labor hoarding, but not that much below trend.  So that looked like a reasonable assumption to me, and that’s what I used in my projection. I differ from the Greenbook in a couple of respects.  One is that I had softer equity and house prices than the staff did.  On the equity front—I think I said this last time—I expected equity prices to be soft, and they’re up 6 percent.  [Laughter]  Fortunately, I don’t back my predictions with my personal wealth.  But—I’m going to hold to that prediction—[laughter] the market still seems to be building in a more rapid increase in profits than seems consistent with moderate nominal GDP growth and some rebalancing of the labor-capital share, which we may be beginning to see.  Certainly, there is practically no growth at all in domestic profits in the Greenbook for ’08.  Now, the market may get more from the foreign profits, as people have been saying, but I think there is potential for disappointment there.  On house prices, inventories are large, and the price-to-rent ratio is still extremely high.  On the demand side, I think demand is being damped by tightening in subprime and alt-A markets.  On the supply side, there will be some more foreclosures, particularly as rates adjust up this year.  So I presume that prices will need to drop somewhat, rather than just stay level as in the staff forecast, even to get the housing stabilization and eventual slight rebound that the staff and I included in our real GDP forecast. Now, to offset the effects of weakness in wealth from these prices, I had a slight easing of monetary policy this year, next year, and the following year—¼ percentage point each year—to get that same output.  This was only a slight easing in real rates given that inflation is edging down and inflation expectations aren’t presumed to change very much.  I did this in the context of what I would have as an interim inflation target of 2 percent.  I think 2 percent is achievable without significant output loss:  It is low by historical standards and broadly consistent with price stability and minimal welfare distortions relative to 1½ percent.  I agree that a little lower might be nice eventually, but I would get there opportunistically by leaning against any increases and accepting decreases rather than deliberately going to 1½ percent.  I’m skeptical about the expectations effect that might accrue from the announcement of a 1½ percent commitment. A second difference with the Greenbook is that I assumed a slightly lower NAIRU— 4¾ percent.  Any point estimate is silly—we really have only the vaguest idea—but it seemed to me that the compensation data, the price data, of the past few years were more consistent with a NAIRU that was a bit below 5—and so I assumed 4¾ percent.  As a consequence, I had slightly less inflation than the staff forecast—0.1 in ’07 and in ’08.  So I had 2.2 in ’07 and 2.0 in ’08 and had it staying there in ’09.  In some sense I thought the more interesting part of the forecast was thinking about the second moments—the skews and the probabilities around the central tendencies.  I confess that for ’07 I committed the sin of thinking things were more uncertain than usual, Mr. Chairman.  [Laughter]  I hate it when I hear people say that.,   So here is my reasoning.  I thought that the average includes lots of episodes of more or less steady growth in steady state and then other episodes of cyclical adjustments.  In my mind, we were in the middle of a kind of mini-cycle, which was an adjustment from greater-than-sustainable growth to growth that we hope is sustainable.  We’ve seen that the adjustment had already created some inventory overhangs and some changes in capital spending plans.  So I thought that, because we’re not at a steady state, things might be a little more uncertain than usual.  But I compensated for that by narrowing my confidence bands in ’08 and ’09 [laughter] when I think we’ll be close to a kind of a steady state. On the skews part, like President Geithner, I had downside skews on output.  It wasn’t so much housing because I think that, with the adjustment to demand or activity that’s in the staff forecast and my own adjustment to prices, the risks around that are approximately balanced.  Nor was it a spreading of problems in the subprime market to other credit markets; I think we’ve seen enough since the subprime problems started to be pretty sure that the risk is no more than the normal kind.  Rather, the risk I saw was from concerns about the financial position and the psychology of the household sector and the interaction of those with housing.  So it was a spillover in some sense from housing to consumption.  The financial obligations ratio is very high.  Households, as President Geithner noted, are highly leveraged.  One of the surprises to me in the development of subprime markets was apparently how many borrowers and lenders were counting on the future appreciation in houses just to support the debt service, to say nothing of the consumption that must be going on at the same time.  I suspect that this is more widespread than just the subprime market.  How many households were expecting price appreciation to continue more as it did before rather than to slow down or even for prices to decline (as I think they will), it’s hard to say.  But I suspect there are a lot of these households, and I think we could get some feedback there.  The staff has the saving rate actually declining in the second and third quarters, and there might be some technical reasons for that.  Even to get modest consumption growth, we see a very gradual uptrend in the saving rate over time.  That might be the most likely outcome, but it did suggest to me that there is at least some fatter tail on the possibility that households, seeing what’s happening in the housing market and to their financial obligations, will draw back more quickly from spending. When President Geithner and I were in Basel, the most popular question to us was whether capital spending would really pick up again.  A number of central bankers doubted that that could happen as long as consumption wasn’t growing more rapidly.  But I’m comfortable with the capital spending pattern so long as the consumption pattern looks something like the pattern in the Greenbook and like the one that I have as my most likely outcome. More generally, as you pointed out at one point last fall, Mr. Chairman, I think we’re in a very unusual situation of below-potential growth for an extended period—a situation that is pretty much unprecedented without breaking out one way or another.  Some nonlinearity is going to come up and bite us here, and, as I see it, the nonlinearity is most likely in the household sector. Now, if income proceeds along the expected path, it seems to me that there are upside risks to inflation moving down to 2 percent and staying there in our forecast.  I think that overall we’re facing a more difficult inflation environment than we have for the past ten years or so:  the high level of resource utilization; rising import prices from the decline in the dollar and the high level of demand relative to potential supply globally, including in the emerging-market economies—one thing we heard in Basel was that increasing numbers of these economies are having trouble sterilizing their reserve accumulation and are running into inflation pressures from that happening—higher prices for energy, food, and other commodities; higher headline inflation; and possibly even slower trend productivity growth.  I didn’t see a downside skew to any of these things.  But, as I thought about the whole picture with all these things seeming to tilt a bit on one side and their interaction, it seemed to me that there was some upside risk to the possibility that inflation expectations would rise rather than stay where they are as assumed in my most likely outcome.  Now, for policy purposes, I would weight the upside risk to inflation more than the downside risk to growth, but we’ll get to that later in the day.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"331";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  The last time we met, one theme was the greater uncertainty, and Governor Kohn mentioned that he is feeling greater uncertainty now than he ever had.  I am not sure that greater uncertainty has been the tenor of the comments here today, but I think it has been greater uncertainty with downside risk.  So the key issue from last time that I think is still with us is that we certainly saw evidence of the slowdown and, as President Stern mentioned, that sometimes we have to acknowledge reality, and we did have much slower growth than many people had been expecting in the two previous meetings.  The Greenbook suggests that the slowdown is unlikely to persist—and I broadly agree with that view, as do many people around the table—but I want to review five key uncertainties that we talked about last time and to discuss how they developed and where they are likely to go. The first uncertainty is investment, and of course, a lot of us have spoken about that.  I would rate the level of uncertainty as still elevated there.  I am not going to use color coding to rate that uncertainty, but I would say it is still elevated.  We have recently gotten some more-solid numbers, but those are just recent; and I think it is still more a glimmer of hope than something we can bank on that we are going to get a turnaround in investment.  That we have seen some better numbers in ISM, durable goods, and so forth says that the direction is perhaps a little more positive than we were thinking six weeks ago.  But there is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty about whether the pickup in business investment will help offset any slowdown in consumption to make sure that we continue to grow in the 2 percent range going forward. The second uncertainty is productivity and potential output.  Obviously that is still at an elevated level.  As far as I am concerned, it is one of the biggest challenges for us to think about in the intermediate run.  In particular, a downside scenario that concerns me is that, if we do not have a pickup in investment, we are unlikely to see a sustained rise in productivity growth.  If perhaps one reason for the lower investment is that there are concerns about productivity growth or returns from that investment, we could have a fairly negative scenario in which we get much lower potential output.  Offsetting that concern is that we are seeing some glimmers of hope on investment.  With respect to potential, I think it is appropriate that the Greenbook has raised participation rates a bit, given that older people seem to be healthier than previous cohorts were and seem to be more willing to work.  However, I think the big question mark is, exactly as David said, that not until August will we get a better feel for which way the data revision will go because the difference between the two sides of the balance sheet is fairly big.  Broadly, I share Gary Stern’s optimism that it is not a good bet to bet against the U.S. economy and against ultimately good productivity growth.  But I have the concern that I do not fully understand the slowness of the investment recovery and some of the productivity slowdown.  There is potentially a worrying downside scenario there. Third is the uncertainty about the housing market and subprime.  Well, obviously, uncertainty on subprime was highly elevated then, and it has come down quite a bit.  We have seen some tightening of lending standards, particularly at the lower end.  The survey of senior loan officers asked for a differentiation between subprime and prime lending standards.  It showed a very dramatic increase in subprime standards, which is exactly what we would expect in this kind of market, certainly potentially reducing demand at least in the lower end of the housing market. About the housing market in and of itself, the uncertainty is still there.  We still have a lot of uncertainty about whether the numbers are telling us about weather or about the actual strength of the market.  As I think I have mentioned to a number of you before, we need to have, besides Dave, a meteorologist on the staff to forecast the weather because every number we hear on the housing market is not a number in which we can put any stock; it all has to do with heat or cold or rain or snow or whatever other thing that Mother Nature may throw at us.  So I still think there is a pretty mixed picture there.  As I said, we have seen very little evidence of spillovers from the subprime market.  The main concern, and this is a variation of what Governor Warsh said, is that something we or the Congress might do might cut off this market.  We have to be mindful of any actions that we may be taking with respect to guidance, as well as of any actions that the Congress may be taking, that could reduce this market more than otherwise. The yield curve is favorable for a lot of the variable-rate subprime borrowers to move into fixed-rate products, with payment shock of perhaps no more than 50 basis points.  The delinquencies we have been seeing have not been due to resets or to payment shock.  They have been due primarily to the so-called juvenile delinquents—the early defaulters going bad.  That means that we do not know what is coming down the line because we have not really seen the experience of the resets.  Now, with the recently benign yield curve, that situation could reasonably be worked out.  The key is whether any equity is left.  If no equity is left and the resets come, these guys are likely to walk.  If they have been doing risk layering—putting really no money down—and the prices go down, that will be a problem.  So I think that may be a bit of a slow burn.  Coupled with the broader misalignment that we are seeing now of a little increase in housing starts, which in some ways we would see as a positive, is a sort of negative given that housing sales seem to be declining so much.  Thus there seems to be a disconnect between supply and demand, and I think the Greenbook is now quite wisely saying that we will likely have a longer transition in the housing market. A fourth area of uncertainty that we talked about last time was the financial markets—the dramatic spike up in volatility.  That volatility spike has come down, but we, being good economists, can never be satisfied with either high volatility or low volatility.  Low volatility is of concern to us, and I very much share the concerns that Tim, Cathy, Kevin, and others have mentioned.  Not only in the United States, but also in the rest of the world, are some of those spreads a bit narrower than they otherwise would be.  In particular, there are concerns about banks chasing private equity deals going covenant-free.  In many of my discussions with private equity folks, instead of saying, well, bring us on more capital, those contacts are the ones saying that the banks are pushing them to take greater leverage than they otherwise would want.  Now, if that isn’t the fox guarding the henhouse, I do not know what is.  You want the banks to be the disciplinary force, and that they would potentially be taking on very large risks is a real concern. The fifth area of uncertainty was consumption.  We have seen a bit of a step-down in consumption growth, but there is still a lot of uncertainty, and I share the exact concerns that Governor Kohn articulated; given that there are likely to be some wealth effects, even though we have some offsetting effects in the stock market, I do not want to bet on those offsetting effects in the stock market being there for the next three quarters.  Housing wealth seems to be flattening, if not coming down, with the Case-Shiller index on average for those ten markets down 3 to 5 percent. If people’s thinking about their consumption pattern is based on some increase in housing wealth, the saving rate should at least gradually increase.  At some point, that reality may be biting and leading to some concern. On the inflation front, once again, we will have continuing uncertainty about what drives short-term to intermediate-term inflation.  As I mentioned last time, we get very, very mild effects from the traditional things that we think that make a difference.  Oil, energy, commodity prices, and resource utilization don’t seem to have that much force, but in both the short and intermediate terms I think they are leaning on the positive side rather than on the negative side.  We still have the owners’ equivalent rent issue that is coming in with the transition in the housing market and is still to some extent temporarily pushing up our measured inflation rates.  Inflation expectations continue to seem to be quite well contained, and that, I think, is key because, given that these other forces do not seem to be important in the short to intermediate run, inflation expectations are very important. So my bottom line is that, although I see some downside risks on growth, I think the Greenbook scenario is a reasonable central tendency one, and I see some important upside risks on inflation."
"332";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Fifth District economic activity continues to be mixed.  Our manufacturing indicators continued to drift lower in the past few weeks, apparently diverging from the national trend.  This may be because furniture and textiles are particularly weak, and these industries are a significantly greater share of our activity than of activity elsewhere.  Respondents’ expectations regarding future manufacturing activity remained upbeat but had drifted a bit lower.  After two bad months, readings on the District’s retail sector have returned to neutral, helped by a sharp turnaround in big ticket sales.  Retail employment and wage indexes rose significantly as well, and expectations for future demand increased sharply. For services firms outside the retail sector, our index has moderated a bit over the past three months, though it remains positive, and measures of expected demand have held up quite well. Housing markets in our District are typically busiest this time of year, as elsewhere, and contacts are reporting softer overall sales this year, as you might expect.  Having said that, I continue, however, to hear reports that homes priced below $250,000 or above $700,000 are selling well. We hear reports of a lack of inventory close to D.C., although President Lockhart has a property for sale you might be interested in.  [Laughter],   Commercial real estate activity generally remains solid, although some observers expressed concern about the sustainability of the quite strong pace of office construction in Northern Virginia.  Our survey measures of manufacturing-price trends seem to have moderated since the beginning of the year, consistent with sluggish demand in that sector. On the services side, price trends seem to have declined somewhat since the first half of last year, although measures of services prices have been choppy and trendless over the past few months as a whole. Turning to the national economy, housing news has been disappointing, but news about business investment and manufacturing has been encouraging.  However, the overall outlook hasn’t changed terribly much since our last meeting.  Housing begins to stabilize in the second half of this year, business investment in equipment and software picks up, and consumer spending remains relatively healthy.  As a result, I expect real growth to return to trend in ’08. Although my outlook broadly agrees with that of the Greenbook, there are some minor differences—but I should emphasize that they are minor.  First, I remain a tad more optimistic about trend growth.  I’m expecting something closer to 2¾ than to 2½.  Second, I still think that residential investment will bottom out in the middle of the year rather than continue to slide into ’08.  Of course, it is quite difficult to have a lot of confidence in any one scenario for the housing market, in part because the recent data have been fairly choppy.  The figures for homes sales, which late last year suggested that housing demand had stabilized, now suggest that demand may be taking another step downward.  If so, this would increase the size of the cumulative reduction in starts relative to new-home sales that will be needed to work off the inventory overhang.  It’s very hard to know, however, just how far housing activity needs to fall before it comes back into stable alignment with income and preferences.  But my hunch is that the drag on growth will not last quite as long as the Greenbook says, and I still see reasonably good prospects for stability in the housing sector in the second half of this year.  I also think that the housing correction will have only limited effects on spending outside residential investment.  In particular, I’m a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook about household spending. As for inflation, the Greenbook now has us waiting until the third quarter of ’08 before we see a moderation in core inflation.  Even then, we get only 0.1 percent.  I would view this outcome as fairly disappointing.  But if I had been asked for an unconditional forecast, I probably would have submitted something a lot like that.  Instead, we were asked for a projection conditional on what, in our judgment, would be an appropriate monetary policy.  So the projection I submitted has core PCE inflation at 1.8 percent next year and 1.6 percent in 2009. Under what, in my judgment, would be an appropriate monetary policy, we use the Chairman’s July testimony to announce that the FOMC’s objective is for PCE inflation to average 1½ percent and that the Committee intends to reduce inflation to that level within two years. While such an announcement would not necessarily shift inflation expectations immediately downward, I project that consistent communications from Committee members accompanied by further rate increases when downside growth risks abate later this year would bring expectations into line with our objective by early next year.  Although growth would be weaker this year than in my unconditional forecast, it would ultimately return to trend in 2008, and the properly measured sacrifice ratio would turn out to be significantly smaller than is often assumed or inferred from standard Phillips curve estimates.  I mention this scenario simply to reiterate that I believe that there’s a feasible alternative to the hypothesis that inflation will settle in around 2 percent or higher unless we engineer a substantial output gap."

Since the last meeting, aggregate economic activity in the Sixth District has expanded moderately.  Employment momentum in most areas of the District continues to exceed that of the nation overall.  Florida is our exception. Most areas of Florida now lag the nation.  Similarly, the housing downturn, as measured by sales and permits, remains less severe in the District than for the nation, except for much of Florida. The housing downturn in Florida has shown little sign of bottoming out, as builders continue to expect even lower levels of construction.  Permit issuance continues in steep decline, down over 50 percent from March a year ago.  We are not inclined to suggest that there is significance for the nation as a whole in the Florida developments.  We have heard anecdotal views from Florida that there was a run-up in speculative activity in the second-home market in 2004 and 2005. Buyers were bidding up prices in anticipation of flipping properties at higher prices.  So Florida is idiosyncratic.  It is idiosyncratic also in the state’s ongoing insurance cost problem related to hurricane risk.  However, in the Atlanta region, the conversations we’ve had with homebuilders about the housing market raised concern of a steepening decline in sales of new homes.  Atlanta has generally tracked the nation, so we are carefully watching housing-sector developments in Georgia, particularly in Atlanta. Despite these negatives in the housing sector, we continue to find only limited evidence of spillover from the residential real estate adjustment to other sectors of the regional economy. Labor markets appear to have remained very tight in the District.  The measured unemployment rate is around 4 percent for the District versus 4.4 percent nationally.  Even the demand for skilled building tradesmen appears strong, as builders—and this may be relevant to the earlier discussion—seem to be taking the opportunity to upgrade the quality of their staffs.  Trends in state sales tax revenue support the view that consumer spending has been relatively unaffected by the housing downturn.  Again, the exception is Florida, where sales tax revenues in the first quarter were substantially below year-ago levels. Our perspective on the national economy is that significant uncertainty remains about the overall outlook for 2007 and for the path of inflation.  Our economic staff uses three models to forecast the key macroeconomic measures.  Our average forecast for real GDP growth is generally in line with the Greenbook forecast, and neither suggests that a recession is a risk. There are minor differences between our composite forecast and the Greenbook on unemployment.  The only significant difference is the declining path of inflation in the Greenbook versus our inflation forecast that holds steady around 2.3 percent for the forecast period.  So, to summarize, we harbor greater doubt than the Board staff that the inflation rate will come down as projected in 2007."
"334";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would characterize where we are compared with the last meeting as that we have gone through a soft patch, which was more extensive than we expected.  But the basic longer-term outlook is really the same as the one that we had the last time around.  That is what is really relevant to our policy decisions because our policy decisions now do not affect the economy until a year or two down the road. Looking at the issue of the risks, I was most worried at the last meeting about what was happening in business fixed investment, particularly because I did not really understand what was going on; and it is always the case that, when you have Knightian uncertainty, you get much more nervous.  The numbers have come in a bit better on those grounds, so I am a little less worried about business fixed investment.  But then we have had a downshift in housing, which again was unexpected.  So when I put those things together, I think that we are in a situation of a fair amount of uncertainty.  Maybe I am a little less worried about the uncertainty and the downside risk, although I think they are still there, only because in the housing case, from the point of view of the longer-run fundamentals, I do not see a big problem.  It really is an inventory-correction issue, which we are trying to sort out.  That is creating uncertainty, but it creates more uncertainty in the shorter term rather than in the longer term.  Even though there is still uncertainty with the issue of business fixed investment, it may be a little bit less.  So perhaps there is a slight skew on the downside in terms of my confidence intervals, but a little less than last time, if that gives me any comfort. About the inflation issue, I am more optimistic than the Greenbook.  I see inflation coming down to 2.1 percent by the end of 2007 and then to 2 percent and staying there thereafter.  My reasoning here, I think, is familiar to you.  I consider long-run inflation expectations to be a key driver of the inflation process.  I see those numbers as around 2 percent, and unless we make a concerted effort to change inflation expectations, I think that is where they will stay.  Also, I am confident that we will do the right thing to make sure that inflation expectations do not go up from there, and I think the markets have similar confidence in that regard. When I look at the risks in terms of inflation, of most concern to me is the issue of what has happened to structural productivity.  We have numbers coming in that we really cannot fully explain.  Maybe there is just something a bit wrong with Okun’s law, and productivity will revert back to it, and then we’re okay.  But maybe there is actually something more, that we have had such tight labor markets when, in fact, the economy has been growing at quite a slow pace.  There is a real question about what this may mean.  If structural productivity is actually downshifting more than we expect, that does create a serious inflation risk that we have to be very concerned about.  On the other side is the issue about whether we really are in tight labor markets.  You look at the numbers in terms of compensation and so forth, and they don’t look too bad.  This might tell us is that the NAIRU may be somewhat lower—again, if we even know exactly what the NAIRU concept means—which is the issue of Knightian uncertainty, not normal uncertainty.  So in this context, the basic forecast outline that we have is actually a fairly benign one.  I am willing to bet that it is probably the most reasonable forecast to have.  I am pretty comfortable with it.  But we will have to wait to see what kind of data come in.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"335";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Seventh District have improved modestly since my last report.  The overall pace of business activity is still rather restrained, but we have seen some pickup in our manufacturing sector.  The key issues regarding the national outlook are the same as the ones the last time we met.  How will the residential investment puzzle settle out, and can we explain this puzzling weakness in business fixed investment? Based on the data that we’ve received since March and my contact calls this round, I’ve become somewhat more optimistic about investment and somewhat more pessimistic about housing.  At the same time, higher gasoline prices have the potential to weigh on consumer spending.  So on balance our growth projection for ’07 and ’08 is a bit lower than it was in March. We now think that growth will average moderately short of potential over the remainder of ’07 and then run close to potential in 2008.   However, our GDP numbers are a bit higher than the Greenbook’s, reflecting both a smaller shortfall from potential this year and a somewhat higher assumption about the rate of potential output growth. Indeed, there has been some good news regarding the near-term outlook.  First, the international outlook continues to improve.  Many of our contacts noted exceptionally strong demand from abroad, particularly for capital goods.  Second, although we’ve been actively looking for spillovers from the problems with subprime mortgages, we have not yet seen major effects on pricing or the supply of credit in other markets.  That is not to say that we have not heard of any effects.  One of our directors, the CFO of a major national homebuilder, noted that tighter underwriting standards are reducing housing demand somewhat outside the subprime sector. Consumers still appear to have ample access to financing.  For example, the head of GM noted that banks were making more auto loans with six- or seven-year maturities in order to lower monthly payments for liquidity-strapped consumers. Finally, as I noted earlier, we feel a bit more confident in our assumption that the weakness in BFI will turn out to be relatively transitory.  I don’t want to make too much out of one month’s noisy data, but the latest readings on capital good orders and the PMI (purchasing managers’ index) were encouraging, and most of the comments from my business contacts have been positive in this regard.  The impression I have from these discussions is that the pause in investment spending is showing early signs of ending; but this is very early, and we clearly need to keep monitoring developments carefully. Beyond the near-term cyclical developments, the changes in structural productivity in the Greenbook highlight an important source of risk to the longer-run outlook for sustainable non- inflationary growth, as Janet just discussed.  There is a lot of uncertainty about the components of structural productivity.  In our view, we haven’t seen enough evidence yet to mark down structural productivity as much as the Greenbook has.  Consequently, our estimate of potential output growth is a bit higher than that of the Greenbook. With regard to inflation, the incoming information has caused the forecasts from our indicator models to come down a bit.  They now project that core PCE prices will rise 2¼ percent this year and 2.1 percent in ’08.  But we do not see any progress beyond that.  If we carry our models out to ’09, they have inflation staying at 2.1 percent, higher than my preferred range. Furthermore, I see some upside risks to this forecast.  Neither our GDP projection nor the Greenbook’s generates any meaningful resource slack over the projection period, and then there are the higher costs for energy and other commodities and increases in import prices.  So we will be relying heavily on stable expectations to keep inflation in check.  I believe we are currently achieving some implicit tightening of policy by keeping rates on hold during this period of sluggish activity, but this restraint will wane if the real economy returns to potential by early next year as we expect.  So I continue to think that the risks to price stability dominate the risks to sustainable growth."
"336";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The near-term outlook for the Third District is moderate growth going forward.  The major source of the strength in the District continues to be employment growth, and nonresidential construction is fairly stable and modestly healthy. However, manufacturing continues to be sluggish and residential construction weak. Job growth has picked up considerably in our District, having grown at 0.9 percent at an annual rate in the past few months.  Unemployment rates have fallen in the region, and the labor market in Pennsylvania in particular has been especially strong.  To get a better handle on labor market conditions, in our last business outlook survey we asked a panel of firms whether they had experienced problems filling jobs in the past three months because applicants didn’t have sufficient qualifications.  Remarkably, more than two-thirds of our firms said that they had trouble with this and that the percentage has been growing since we first started asking the question three years ago. The strength in the regional labor markets is reflected in the rebound in our staff’s indexes of leading indicators of economic activity in the three states in our District, especially in Pennsylvania, where the index is predicting stronger growth over the remaining three quarters of the year.  An area of stability in our region’s economy has been the ongoing modest strength in nonresidential construction.  The growth in this sector has recently been largely in noncommercial construction—hospitals, education buildings, and so forth.  However, general commercial vacancy rates in Philadelphia have been falling steadily, and the absorption rate in Center City is nearly at a record high.  With regard to manufacturing, growth is stalled. According to our April manufacturing survey, our general activity index is close to zero, or just mildly positive, as it has been since late last year.  Both new orders and shipments are close to zero, as they were.  Further, in April the index of future capital expenditures was down somewhat and below the averages that we have been seeing in most expansions.  The only bright spot was the significant bump-up in our future activity index, which signaled that more-robust activity is anticipated by our survey participants.  It also comes as no surprise that residential construction remains weak in the District, and housing permits have continued to decline as the value of residential construction contracts has as well.  Also, there seems to be little or no appreciation in house prices.  On the inflation front in the District, prices paid and prices received by manufacturers have moderated a bit.  Further, retailers are reporting very little change in prices over the past few months.  In summary, the Third District is growing slowly, and our staff projection is for modest growth going forward.  Labor market fundamentals appear strong, but we have yet to see any sign of the pickup in manufacturing that some of the national numbers indicate. On the national level, since the last meeting I have actually become a bit more comfortable with the economic situation.  While I say that I am more comfortable, that’s a relative not an absolute statement.  The most recent month’s readings on core inflation were welcome, but I think that caution and vigilance are still the order of the day.  Indeed, the Greenbook authors, as we’ve noted, seem to have been revising their forecast of core inflation upward slightly over the past several months rather than downward, and that to me is a bit disturbing, even if the numbers don’t change a whole lot. News that has made me more comfortable with the projection of a somewhat quicker return to something closer to trend growth in the second half of the year is the recent strength in durable goods orders and the ISM numbers, which are indicating that manufacturing has picked up.  Further, recent strength in manufacturing was broadly based, and the output of business equipment was strong.  Along this dimension, I am in agreement with the latest forecast of the Board staff.  However, these reports represent only one month of data, as people have said, and although they are consistent with a modest bounceback in the second quarter, there is still substantial uncertainty.  I hope that, in the coming months, those data will be reinforced as new data come in; but, again, at this point that is only wishful thinking.  I would add, though, that my business contacts, particularly in the financial sector, continue to report to me that business loans are strong, C&I loans are strong, demand is strong for loans, and balance sheets and firms still look good.  So they see things as looking good from their perspective, but that positive news is not really showing up in some of these other numbers, at least as yet.  So I’m a bit puzzled by that.  Furthermore, job growth and personal income growth appear to be on solid footing, and I find myself increasingly puzzled by the weakness in the labor market as portrayed by the Greenbook forecast.  The strength in personal income, along with a rebound in asset markets, leads me to view consumption as somewhat healthier going forward than the Greenbook sees it. Those circumstances, coupled with the more positive news on investment to which I just alluded, lead me to view closer-to-trend growth as the best forecast and, therefore, to have a little more optimism in my outlook for the second half of the year and into ’08.  That is reflected in the forecast that I submitted. That said, I realize there are significant risks to this return to trend growth.  The biggest risk remains housing.  The extreme fluctuations in weather over the past four to five months have made discerning trends a lot more difficult, and I’m not sure exactly how much seasonal adjustment factors are bouncing the numbers around and making it harder to disentangle effects. Inventories of housing, as we have talked about, remain extremely high, and there is very little signal of a pickup in demand, at least as yet.  However, I’m a little skeptical that this sector will continue to subtract a full percentage point of real growth from the forecast, as the Greenbook suggests.  I’m a little more optimistic than that.  I remain optimistic in part because I think real mortgage rates remain relatively low.  I see strong income growth continuing, and I am increasingly less concerned, actually, about the spillover from subprime markets.  So I can envision housing demand strengthening a bit more than is implied in the Greenbook, and that leads to less of a subtraction going forward. On the inflation front, I’m a bit less worried than last time but far from sanguine.  The last core PCE inflation number was obviously very encouraging at something close to zero, but, again, we have to be very careful in extrapolating out one month’s data.  As I said before, the Greenbook authors seem to be inching up their forecast of core inflation or at least pushing the decline out further into the future, and that concerns me a bit.  I believe inflation is still too high. Inflation expectations are stable, but they are too high as well, and we need to bring that rate down.  Thus, we need to be vigilant here and continue with a somewhat restrictive policy. In regard to my forecast, I’m not going to say much.  I just assure you that, without collusion, President Lacker’s view of the forecast and how it evolves is very similar to mine.  So rather than repeat what he said, I will just let his comments largely speak for mine.  I have a slightly faster return to trend growth, partly because my productivity estimates are somewhat higher.  I thought Janet Yellen’s comments about her productivity analysis were quite thoughtful, and I appreciate them.  The optimal monetary policy, or at least my preferred path for monetary policy, might include some tightening if trend growth returns more quickly than we had indicated.  But, indeed, my forecast for core PCE was actually down to 1.7 percent by 2009.  I’ll stop there.  Thank you."
"337";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The anecdotal reports that I have accumulated since we last met are almost—I guess I should eliminate “almost”—are unambiguously on the soft side.  I emphasize “soft,” which I think is a better word than “weak,” except perhaps with my trucking industry contact, who says that volume in both March and April is down 6 percent over a year ago and does not know exactly what is happening.  Trucking company bankruptcies are up sharply—24 percent above a year ago.  Truck shipping rates are weak—for the first quarter they were up just slightly year over year, and in the second quarter they were down a couple of percentage points.  My contact says that the volume declines are general across the country and widespread across industry segments.  The company has reduced capacity and will continue to do so, and others in the industry are doing the same thing.  So there is a big inventory of used trucks sitting out there in the market, and some of these trucks are being sold abroad. In the package delivery business are FedEx and UPS.  I mention the names of those companies because it is obvious who is in the package delivery business; you cannot really disguise that.  [Laughter]  FedEx says that the business is coming in a little below plan and that its volume in less-than-truckload business is flat.  Others are down.  Domestic express volume is down 2 percent year over year.  The ground package network is growing substantially—a lot of that is diversion from the express business because ground delivery is cheaper.  FedEx may be delaying some of its expansion projects, putting them off three to twelve months—not fundamentally changing its long- run expansion plans but delaying some capital expenditures, which are expected to be down 10 percent from the earlier plan for this year but still up 10 percent over the previous fiscal year.  My contact expressed confidence that the slowdown is temporary; he expects a pickup in the August- September timeframe.  FedEx has no difficulty in hiring the people the company needs except in accounting and audit fields.  I heard essentially the same story from UPS.  Ground volume there is up about 2 percent year over year.  UPS is having to discount rates after putting through price increases last year.  Cap-ex is up somewhat in ’07 compared with ’06.  Profit margins are under huge pressure; the pricing environment is very competitive. I developed a new contact in the QSR industry.  Now, you may not know what the QSR industry is, but it stands for “quick serve restaurants.”  Other people call it fast food.  [Laughter]  In the restaurant business, the casual dining industry is a more discretionary kind of outlay, and that traffic is down 7 percent year over year.  Traffic in the QSR industry is down 5 to 6 percent.  This is across the industry, all the different companies in that business.  They have been putting through price increases of roughly 3 percent.  So in terms of dollar volume, their comps are down—in the 3 percent to 4 percent area. My contact from a large U.S. bank notes that the economy is in a soft patch that may be extended for a while and that business cash flow and balance sheets are solid.  There is something of a mystery as to why cap-ex is not stronger.  From proprietary, internal data on credit card usage, I learned that the growth of credit card usage is slowing; it had been about 5 percent year over year and is down to 4 percent.  On an early reading of the April data, “distinctly weak” was the comment.  Particularly, non-auto sales may have declined—I guess we get the retail sales number on Friday.  It is likely that April retail sales are weak.  Talking about credit demand, a lot of the demand for C&I loans, according to my contact, is really not the standard C&I type of thing but instead is being driven primarily by merger and acquisition activity, hedge funds, private equity, and state and local government borrowing.  Credit quality remains very high. On the outlook, my take is that the economy has slowed, and the real issue is whether we have a temporary soft patch from which the economy will recover on its own or whether this is the beginning of a cumulative weakness.  It is often the case, particularly if you think about some of the models of business cycles, that weakness after a time can feed on itself and become cumulative.  I do not think that we know enough to be able to make really a solid estimate on that.  I would note that we likely do not have an inventory complication, which has been so important in past business- cycle developments.  Inventories seem to be pretty well controlled on the whole.  Also, output is certainly being supported by the stock market and by a weaker dollar.  I would also note the unabated growth in the monetary aggregates, both MZM and M2—we see no sign of traditional downturn behavior from those measures.  I will stop there.  Thank you."
"338";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for the economy, which is essentially for sustained growth near trend and for a modest diminution of core inflation over time, hasn’t changed appreciably.  To be sure, I have marked down my forecast for this year, largely in recognition of reality—that is, the weak first quarter, and I anticipate some further sluggishness in the second quarter as well.  But after that, I expect growth to accelerate to near trend.  Underpinning that anticipated performance is productivity improvement of something like 2¼ percent a year or maybe a little less, and employment gains in the neighborhood of 0.6 to 0.8 percentage point per year.  On the demand side, I expect sustained increases in consumer spending; in business investment, including structures; and in net exports.  I don’t think the outlook for the housing sector has really changed appreciably recently, at least relative to what I had been expecting.  Given that inventory levels were and are still high, I think that it will be some time before we see any meaningful improvement in residential construction.  My confidence in this general view of the outlook is heightened by my interpretation of history.  The economy grew 3 percent or better over the four years from 2003 through 2006.  More important and more broadly, if you think about the performance of the economy over the past two and a half decades, it hasn’t been wise to make major bets against sustained, healthy growth.  So that’s what I’m really expecting. As for inflation, because I view the current stance of monetary policy as moderately restrictive—and the basis for that is some versions of the Taylor rule, estimates of the real federal funds rate relative to its equilibrium, and some rules of thumb that we have—I do expect that core inflation will gradually slow from here, assuming that we maintain the approximate stance of policy that we have adopted.  I think that another reason is that some of the uptick in core inflation was transitory.  I would add that, if you look at the latest three-, six-, and twelve-month increases in core CPI or core PCE, you do in fact see some waning of inflation. Of course, the waning is due in part to the favorable numbers we got in March, but it doesn’t appear to be exclusively due to the March numbers.  In any event, if inflation is going to slow, it has to be in the latest numbers.  [Laughter]  I mean, there is no other way for that to occur.  With that, I will conclude.,   Sometimes the obvious escapes me.  [Laughter]"
"339";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My own views on the economy haven’t changed much since we last met and aren’t terribly at odds with the Greenbook.  I’d highlight a couple of reasons for concern, a couple of areas in which the misses could be severe.  I share the views expressed by many around the table, most recently by Governor Kohn, on the inflation front.  I remain quite concerned about inflation prospects, and I’m keeping a wary eye on inflation expectations, particularly if there were to be acceleration in the trends on commodity prices or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  My sense is that the markets haven’t fully taken into account what that could be, and we could find the markets more preoccupied with an inflation scare than they appear to be at this moment.  So I think that, during the balance of ’07, the inflation risks tend to be more significant than the growth risks, and I would expect to see sequential increases in GDP, as in the Greenbook, as we go through the next several quarters. The big point of what that is predicated on is really the continued accommodation in the credit markets and the capital markets, as several people have noted. I was thinking about my projections and, as we look to ’08 and ’09, the bigger risks there tend to be more policy oriented as we head into the next election, and they may well have some effect on the capital markets.  So as I think about the second half of ’08 and the first half of ’09 and what the likely GDP implications would be, I can’t help but think that changes or perceived changes in tax policy and trade policy could be the biggest drivers to the capital markets and, as a result, have the biggest effects on the macroeconomy.  So there are huge risks, as I look beyond ’07, in terms of where GDP might come out; but as a central case, the Greenbook formulation looks roughly in accord with my own. Let me spend a moment on consumption.  My view is broadly consistent with what others have said earlier today.  I spoke in the past week with one credit card company whose customer base is similar to the average aggregate customer base in the United States.  They have about one-fifth of all credit card spending, and they reported to me their April results, which might provide us with some clues about PCE growth and credit quality.  Card spending for April, from their perspective, was consistent with moderate deceleration in real consumption.  They ended up in April with nominal year-over-year growth of about 4 percent in non-auto retail sales, which is a slowdown from the fourth quarter of ’06 and a slowdown from January, but it is up a bit from February and March, when they were getting quite despondent and were worrying a bit about their projections for the next three quarters.  They think their April numbers look okay, quite consistent with the moderate deceleration that many folks here have talked about.  They believe that they have hit the floor on that, but time will tell.  What they have not been able to do, at least up to the time of my discussions with them, is to break out retail purchases outside fuel to find out whether less strength is there than the 4 percent top-line number would suggest.  I suspect that would be the case.  How all this fits into market expectations we’ll know over the next couple of days.  This strikes me as an average, okay number that may be a touch better than market expectations, but it shouldn’t give us a whole lot of comfort if we’re trying to suggest that there is a robust recovery on consumption and PCE.  Credit quality remains very strong across consumer credit and the company’s mortgage products.  I would note that they don’t have much subprime in their portfolio—what is subprime has fallen to that level rather than having begun there when they issued the credit.  Payment rates, use of credit lines, delinquencies, charge- offs—all are at very positive levels with little indication of more-serious weakening of consumer demand.  So, again, I think the prospects outlined by the Greenbook in terms of PCE look broadly consistent with the April numbers. Let me turn now to the capital markets and the credit markets and speak about three or four observations that may be a bit more newsworthy than when we last met six weeks ago. First, I will talk a little about the dearth of defaults in corporate loans, then spend a couple of moments on private equity, building on Bill Dudley’s discussion at the outset on the correlation among asset classes, and finally spend a moment on the shakeout in the mortgage markets.  The predicate for this is something that we all know, and several people have spoken about earlier today.  As corporate America has become more cautious, Wall Street has become more aggressive to satisfy investors’ appetites for risk.  So we’re seeing risk aversion in one category on Main Street and real risk-seeking behavior on Wall Street.  Financial risk-taking remains high and may well have even increased since we last met.  If you’ll look at the MOVE options index measuring one-month volatility on Treasuries, it’s the lowest it has been in about nine years, since the index came into being, and it suggests President Minehan’s point that all the forces of liquidity and froth that might be in the market are probably more present today than any of us could have imagined given the tumult in the markets in late February.  At the same time, nonfinancial corporate risk-taking continues to be more subdued than objective measures would suggest it should be.  There is reason to hope that the cap-ex data will come around to where many of us expected it to be already, but some determination still needs to be done on that.  So we hear, and some of us even say, that these capital markets appear priced to perfection, that credit markets are as strong as ever, and that liquidity is plentiful.  I would add my concern to the implausibility of that notion, which President Geithner and others spoke about.  The reason for central bankers to worry is, of course, that these narrower spreads provide less of a shock absorber for unforeseen events. Let me now go through the points that I mentioned at the outset and describe their implications for the decisions we make.  First is the dearth of defaults on corporate loans. Historically low year-ahead default rates were referenced in the Greenbook, and they should give us comfort, at least in theory.  I share the Greenbook view that corporate defaults should increase as profits level out and leverage increases to more normal levels.  But fewer defaults are even possible in this financing environment, and that makes me a little less sanguine about those data. If we think about covenant packages on corporate loans, both originated on Wall Street and originated at community banks—I think President Yellen spoke at a previous meeting about covenant-lite deals—it is incredibly hard to get defaults in the context of these loans, never mind event-of-default notices and everything else that would find its way into the indentures.  As a result, we have seen a recent spate of financings with covenant packages that are increasingly issuer-friendly, without triggers that would otherwise cause defaults:  no debt payment schedules, never mind even the need to make interest payments, with the ability to turn those into sort of pay-in-kind notes.  All of that, it strikes me, should make us nervous if business fundamentals shift abruptly and investors are left with little opportunity to gain access to their capital or to be in a position to force companies to restructure their operations.  As a result I am less sanguine about these low default data that we continue to receive from Wall Street. A second point is the state of private equity in the capital markets.  What I note builds on the recent history that we’ve seen:  massive fund-raisings; larger LBOs; increasing leverage; in the past twelve months, we’ve seen the so-called club deal phenomenon; the growth of equity bridges, which I and others have talked about; and when we last met, we discussed the interest many of these firms have for rushing into the capital markets by finding permanent capital.  The newest development is the growth of syndication in the equity placement in these LBO markets. The same way that we have syndicated debt markets that have matured incredibly over the past six to ten years, on the equity side there are huge investments that are presently being considered and potentially being made.  So one LBO sponsor might fund a certain portion of the equity check on an LBO and then line up, through an equity syndicate manager at a traditional investment bank or a commercial bank, the ability to sell down the rest of that equity through an infrastructure and distribution system that is being built.  I doubt that we will see that syndication market five years from now as deep and as large as the debt markets.  But I do think that it shows us that new liquidity continues to come even to the private placement 144(a) markets alongside the growth in the public capital markets.  That liquidity could well improve tradability.  To the extent that these syndications are new, they show us that liquidity is plentiful; but they also show us that many of these new mechanisms have not been stress-tested.  The other implication of this boom in private equity is that it has raised the floor on equity prices.  My sense is that there is a private equity put that may well have replaced what used to be thought of as a Federal Reserve put on the floor of equity prices, and that equity put appears to be larger than it has ever been. Thus we have seen increased total leverage through these structured products; credit markets, as I’ve mentioned, are more robust; and there is a question of stress testing, which is still to be determined. Another point on the capital markets relates to what Bill said about the correlation among asset classes.  CEOs, CFOs, and chief risk officers of large financial firms have found quite troubling the greater correlation among asset classes than most of their internal models had suggested.  As they looked at their dashboards in the weeks after the tumult that we saw last February, they grew increasingly uncomfortable about whether they had accurately measured what their firms’ downside risks are.  Certainly it’s encouraging, as Bill showed us, that there appears to be less correlation over recent weeks.  That’s a lesson being learned and relearned and tested and retested in these institutions.  That they may be heeding the wakeup call is good news, but time will tell whether it will be enough to catch up before problems arise in the market. My final point concerns the consequences of a shakeout in the mortgage markets.  My sense is that, after the fallout in subprime, the market is becoming more consolidated with larger, more-sophisticated lenders that can more quickly provide more markets that satisfy customers’ newest wants.  The success in these markets of investment banks and hedge funds will go to those with scale, with strong distribution systems, and with control over their servicing businesses, so that they are effectively able to engineer workouts and avoid the need to foreclose. I think that over the balance of this year we will hear more news from small and medium-sized commercial banks that feel as though their market share is being taken away during this tumult, and that is something that we need to continue to observe.  With that, Mr. Chairman, I’ll save the rest of my comments for the next round."
"340";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in New England seem broadly supportive of the continued expansion of the region at about the pace of the nation as a whole, perhaps because the pace of national activity has slowed somewhat and so the region seems to be lagging less, though I do think there is a bit of a brighter tone to economic activity.  I certainly do not want to overemphasize that, however, as concerns do linger about the strength of job growth and the housing market, among other things. Two matters came up in our rounds of gathering data and anecdotes around the region. First, although growth in overall labor costs in the region is moderate relative to that of the nation, concerns continue about the cost and availability of skilled labor.  Respondents are also increasingly concerned about other input costs—oil, copper, zinc, other metals, and chemicals—and report that they are attempting to pass on higher costs within the supply chain or directly to consumers and are succeeding in many cases.  We have not heard much locally yet about the effect of three dollars a gallon for gasoline, and I am hoping the refinery outages that apparently caused this uptick prove temporary enough not to dent regional demand or to increase price pressures.  However, the general rise in primary energy costs is not particularly reassuring.  Second, while the residential real estate data for the region continue to be downbeat in terms of permits, starts, year-over-year sales, and price trends, anecdotes—particularly as they regard high-end markets, as I noted before—offer some hope that the spring picture for sales of existing homes will be brighter when all the data are in.  I had a comment in here about spring weather; but that turned yesterday, so I won’t make that comment.  [Laughter] The incoming data since the last Committee meeting contained some pluses and minuses that, by and large, offset one another.  Thus our forecast in Boston, which is quite close to the Greenbook and similar to other forecasts around the table, has not changed an awful lot.  In short, the economy appears to have made what one hopes is the final step-down in overall growth from its unsustainable momentum of only a year or so ago and is in the process of settling in at a pace that will gradually accelerate over this year to slightly below potential in ’08 and ’09.  This forecast assumes that the effect of the housing bust begins to subside by midyear and that business and consumer confidence remains strong enough to support continued hiring, consumption, and business investment.  It also assumes that strength in the rest of the world buoys corporate profits and foreign consumption of our exports and, combined with a slowly declining dollar, adds at least marginally to U.S. growth.  All of this occurs with a continuation of very accommodative financial markets that both sustain household wealth and ease borrowing costs and provide a haven for foreign investment flows.  Finally, the current boost in energy costs proves temporary, and inflation subsides gradually as unemployment moves up slightly, reflecting the output gap created by a year or more of slightly sub-potential performance.  Looking at the data we received on other projections through ’09, our forecast fell within the central tendency in all the areas, but I think that we see inflation as somewhat more persistent than others do—along the lines of the Greenbook.  In fact, this forecast sounds pretty good to me as an outcome if it works out this way, and I have even begun to think, versus where I was at the last meeting, that the risks around both sides of this forecast may be a little smaller. On the growth side, the big question involves spillovers from the housing bust and possibly the problems with subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, but we have been expecting to see spillovers for some time, and they are yet to emerge in any real way.  They still might, and we, like the Greenbook authors, have marked down our forecast for residential investment in ’07 based on incoming data.  But I am inclined to think that broader market and economic spillovers get less likely over time.  In fact, as I noted before, maybe there is some leveling-off in sales of existing homes if we smooth through the month-to-month variation in the data.  Credit restraints could well damp the participation of subprime borrowers in home purchases, but low mortgage rates ought to support prime borrowers, and we see evidence for this in discussions with local banks and certainly all the advertisements in newspapers and on television that are focusing on the theme that now is the time to borrow because mortgage rates are low and maybe they will not stay that way for long.  So we think—I think anyway—that we have some reason to believe that, through this year, home buying may help keep home prices and equity positive or perhaps neutral contributors to household wealth.  Indeed, assuming that gasoline prices edge off their current high levels and that equity markets continue on an upward pace, there is at least some possibility on the upside for consumer spending. Another aspect to the growth forecast that concerned me at our last meeting was the unusually slow pace of business investment in equipment and software.  Given the underlying fundamentals of robust corporate profits, cash reserves, and a declining user cost, especially for high-tech goods, we would have expected faster growth.  I am still concerned here, especially as such spending patterns could augur poorly for continued hiring, but I find the most-recent data on orders and shipments and the ISM survey encouraging, although as President Moskow mentioned, one should not take a lot of confidence from a single month’s data.  So all in all, it seems, to me anyway, that the downside risks around growth in our forecast are a bit less. On the inflation front, I remain concerned that the forecast is just a bit too perfect.  Without too extended a growth slump, unemployment rises slightly, and inflation falls slowly.  We have not done the work that San Francisco has on slicing and dicing productivity, and I found Janet’s comments very interesting.  I also am very much in agreement with her and others’ perspective that the level of underlying structural productivity growth may not be declining to the degree that the Greenbook authors seem to think it might.  However, if what seems to be a cyclical low continues, unemployment could well be sticky.  Both the recent increase in energy and raw material costs and the burgeoning growth in the rest of the world could increase resource pressures at the same time that the dollar continues its slow decline.  All of this taken together could be a recipe for accelerating rather than decelerating inflation.  As I’ve noted before, I really have no problem with stable inflation around its current low level.  What does concern me, however, is the potential for acceleration.  In that regard, the recent small moderation in core data was welcome, though certainly not sufficient to ease this concern entirely. In sum, I remain ready to bet on the baseline forecast.  I think it is about as good as we can hope for.  There continue to be risks on both sides, but at this point I would not weigh them equally. Being wrong on the inflation side could be a more difficult place to be.  That is, if growth falters, it is clear what to do; but if inflation should accelerate, it might take a while and be quite costly to remedy.  Thus, I would continue to favor policy that incorporates a bit of insurance.  But we will get to that later.  Thank you.,   A quick comment was just brought to mind because of Tim’s comments.  I regularly meet with a group of investment people before FOMC meetings. Compared with the past several months—particularly during the time of the last meeting, when we were just coming off some financial market upset, especially in the equity markets—they were saying that they felt that financial markets were frothier right now than they had been over the past three or four years; there was more money out there chasing more deals and a level of froth that to them seemed unsustainable.  I don’t know what implications that has for current policysetting—I’m not wise enough to know that.  But I do see it, as Tim indicated that he did, as a risk that lies over the whole environment.  Even though we have slower growth and somewhat higher inflation, this overall forecast is so benign; and despite what the yield curve and the fed funds futures tell us, the market seems to be buying into the whole benign outlook and thinking that it’s going to continue forever.  Clearly it won’t.  What the spillover effects will be and what we can do about them now or in succeeding meetings are questions to which I don’t have an answer; but I do think they are questions, and I would like to reiterate what Tim had to say."
"341";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy from the perspective of the Fourth District isn’t materially different from the way I heard Dave describe national conditions. Manufacturers in the District generally report modest but steady growth.  In particular, metals producers and their suppliers report strong orders and production.  My business contacts are telling me that capital investment is a bit soft, but it should not at this point pose a serious problem for the overall economy. I’ve had several meetings with homebuilders throughout my District in the past few weeks, and they confirmed some of the information that we see in the national data—sales are still very anemic, and the inventory of unsold homes remains quite high.  They also shared some information that is not easy to pull from the national indicators.  For example, sales of starter and lower-end homes are particularly slow, in part because lending standards have been significantly tightened.  This means that there has been a shift in the composition of homes sold toward the upper end of the price spectrum, causing the reported sales-price data to be a little inflated.  The builders I spoke with assure me that price discounts are occurring and that the discounts have been substantial.  Likewise, I am told that appraisers are increasingly being asked by lenders to do whatever possible to appraise the properties relative to current market conditions and to discount price information from the historical comparables.  My contacts are also saying that the expectation that home prices are going to fall further has been keeping some buyers on the sidelines for now.  I also hear that, when possible, residential contractors are shifting resources to nonresidential projects.  Some nationally publicly traded home construction companies are completing houses and selling them for a loss in some markets just so that they can exit those markets more quickly.  What I take away from my conversations with homebuilders and lenders is that the national data may not yet fully have caught up with the poor conditions in the residential construction sector and, further, those closest to the markets are betting that any semblance of a recovery is still a long way off. This information had an influence on the economic projections that I submitted for today’s meeting.  Like the Greenbook, which as a consequence of more weakness in residential construction has shaved an additional 0.5 percentage point off GDP growth in the latter half of this year, I have marked down my expectations for growth in 2007.  My projection sees a little more growth relative to what I see in the Greenbook as we move into 2008 and 2009, although I do see slower economic growth as an obvious risk to my outlook.  I’m especially concerned about the possibility of some spillover from the housing sector to the business investment outlook. My inflation projection calls for a slightly more optimistic trend in core PCE than what I see in the Greenbook.  I had difficulty endorsing a three-year projection that doesn’t assume that our policies are going to be positioned so that we eventually bring core PCE inflation back below 2 percent, if only just below.  So my inflation projection represents my interpretation of appropriate monetary policy—namely one that will bring core PCE in under 2 percent.  My economic projection is, therefore, based on a federal funds rate path that is very similar to the Greenbook baseline, a constant path over the projection period; but I have assumed a slightly more optimistic price path for oil.  Given Karen’s comments this morning, I am a little more comfortable with that assumption.  I also have slightly more potential than the Greenbook does. So with these two assumptions, I do have a slightly lower path for inflation than the Greenbook does.  Obviously, these assumptions are not made with great conviction, and inflation may continue to track just north of 2 percent.  If it does, we do risk conditioning expectations to this level, and that is an outcome that I would not welcome. I had an opportunity just a few weeks ago to spend a day with Paul Volcker, who visited Cleveland.  On the subject of inflation, he reminded me that in his experience big inflations start out as a tolerance of modest inflations.  Once inflation expectations drag their anchor a little, it’s difficult and costly to get them re-anchored; and this, I think, remains the biggest risk that we face as a Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"342";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My assessment of the economic outlook and the risks to it is largely unchanged since our last meeting.  The data since that meeting have been mixed. On the one hand, the very sluggish real GDP growth in the first quarter gives me pause concerning potential downside risks.  Much of the first-quarter weakness, of course, was due to housing, and I really don’t see that sector starting to turn around at this point.  My homebuilder and banking contacts report stricter underwriting standards for all mortgages, not just subprime ones, so residential investment could remain a significant drag on the economy over the near term as the Greenbook now envisions.  Indeed, whereas the Greenbook assumes that national house prices are flat going forward, I am worried that they may actually fall.  On the other hand, the improved picture of auto inventories along with some positive glimmers on manufacturing and business investment suggests that those sectors may prove to be less of a drag on the economy going forward.  With respect to inflation, the recent news has also been somewhat mixed with lower-than- expected readings on core consumer prices and labor compensation offset by higher prices for energy, other commodities, and imports. Taking a longer view, I anticipate real GDP growth over the next two and a half years of about 2.6 percent, just a bit below my assessment of potential.  My forecasts of both actual and potential growth are a tenth or two stronger than the Greenbook forecasts; but the basic story is very similar, and the underlying assumptions, including the path for the nominal funds rate, are essentially the same.  I view the stance of monetary policy as remaining somewhat restrictive throughout the entire forecast period.  The key factors shaping the longer-term outlook include continued fallout from the housing sector, with housing wealth projected to be roughly flat through 2008.  Given the reduced impetus from housing wealth, household spending should advance at a more moderate pace going forward than over the past few years. This slowdown in consumption is reinforced by more-moderate gains in personal income, as the unemployment rate gradually rises, reaching 5 percent in 2009.  Although I anticipate that the labor market will remain fairly tight over the next year, I do not expect faster compensation growth to exert significant upward pressure on prices.  I expect it instead to restrain profits, given that labor’s share of income is now at an exceptionally low level.  I also anticipate that various temporary factors that have been boosting inflation, such as the run-up in owners’ equivalent rent and the pass-through of energy prices, should dissipate, while inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Overall, I’m more optimistic regarding inflation than the Greenbook and anticipate that core PCE price inflation will edge down below 2 percent after next year. One of the more interesting questions about the outlook, as David noted in the questions to him, is how to reconcile the strong labor market performance with the weak growth in output or, equivalently, how much of the recent slowdown in productivity growth is likely to persist.  And that is something that we have been thinking about, too.  Over the four quarters of 2006, nonfarm business productivity rose 1.6 percent, about half as fast as the average pace set from 2000 through 2005.  Whether these recent lower numbers reflect a transitory drop in growth or a downshift in the trend rate is an important issue.  A lot of excellent research has been done on this topic by staff at the Board and elsewhere in the System.  My reading of the evidence at this point is that the recent decline in productivity growth does largely reflect cyclical factors.  I think productivity growth has fallen significantly below trend because of labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output. We have also been giving close scrutiny to the behavior of the residential construction sector and productivity in that sector.  My staff has done some work on estimating what productivity growth has been over the past year or so in residential investment and in the nonfarm business sector outside residential investment.  They estimate that essentially all of last year’s slowdown in labor productivity growth is due to the behavior of productivity in residential construction.  We estimate that residential construction productivity dropped 10 to 15 percent in 2006, whereas productivity in the nonfarm business sector outside residential investment was well maintained. Exactly why those lags exist, again, is a mystery to me as well as to David and others. But going forward, it seems to us that, as the adjustment lags work themselves out, residential construction employment will likely post significant declines, and productivity in that sector and the economy as a whole will rebound.  That said, the pace of structural productivity growth may also have declined slightly as the Greenbook hypothesizes.  Relative to the second half of the 1990s, both the pace of productivity growth in the IT sector and the pace of investment in equipment and software have slowed, and these factors have probably depressed trend productivity growth slightly in recent years and are likely to continue depressing it somewhat going forward. But the hypothesis that the recent decline in productivity growth is mainly structural does not seem to me to square well with the broad range of available evidence.  Recall that in the 1990s there was a whole constellation of evidence—including a booming stock market, robust consumption, and rapid business investment—that was consistent with a hypothesis of a lasting increase in the rate of productivity growth.  In contrast, over the past year or so, business investment in equipment has been very sluggish and more so than seems warranted by the deceleration in business output.  So such weakness could reflect lower assessments by companies of their ability to improve productivity through the installation of new capital, and that is, I think, consistent with the lower trend of productivity growth.  But you would think that a marked slowdown in secular productivity growth would also result in downward revisions to the expected paths of future profits and real wages, weakening equity market valuations and crimping consumption growth.  I have seen no signs over the past year that household perceptions of their future wealth accumulation have been downgraded. In sum, the data seem consistent with the view that the recent slowdown in nonfarm business productivity represents a temporary cyclical drop that is concentrated in residential construction combined with a modest decline in the trend.  So I remain optimistic that the underlying productivity trend is at or only slightly below 2½ percent."
"343";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070509meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our outlook has changed very little.  As in March, we see the expansion continuing, with growth moving back up to potential—we see potential around 3 percent—later this year.  This view rests on the familiar expectations:  Housing stabilizes relatively soon without a major drop in prices; investment spending strengthens somewhat as the temporary factors holding it down recede and positive fundamentals reassert themselves; consumption moderates a bit but continues to be supported by strong income growth; the saving rate moves up but only modestly and slowly; and external demand remains strong.  We still expect inflation to moderate gradually to a rate just below 2 percent for the core PCE by the end of ’08.  We view the recent numbers as somewhat reassuring.  Recent data in general have provided a bit more comfort for this scenario.  On balance, the downside risks to growth have diminished a bit.  The risk that inflation will fail to moderate sufficiently, however, remains significant and material.  But in general, the overall outlook, in our view, hasn’t changed that much. Now, our forecast assumes that we hold the fed funds rate where it is for a while.  Our expected path is above the market’s but below the Greenbook’s.  We’re below the Greenbook because, although our expected forecast is really similar, we attach somewhat greater weight to alternative scenarios that suggest slower growth.  The recent growth numbers have been, on balance, encouraging, and the markets are a bit more confident about the outlook than they were. But I still think the downside risks to growth are significant.  Housing could still surprise on the downside, and we could see a deeper, more protracted contraction in activity and, of course, broadly based more-substantial declines in prices.  Consumption could be weaker for this reason or because the saving rate rises for other reasons, such as pessimism about long-run income growth.  The household sector is substantially more leveraged than it was, and it has less of a cushion to absorb shocks and, therefore, presents some risk of amplifying rather than mitigating broader weakness in the economy.  Although a bit better than it was in March, the investment outlook is still a bit tenuous, and it seems unlikely to be a substantial source of strength if broader weakness in demand in the rest of the economy materializes.  The most rapidly growing parts of the world are growing well above potential and face rising inflation and substantial asset-price inflation, and I think the authorities there are generally starting tentatively to tighten policy more significantly. On the inflation front, we still face substantial uncertainty about what is happening to underlying trends and how they will evolve.  The broader inflation environment is, if anything, less benign than it has been over the past three quarters, with inflation accelerating a little outside the United States, energy and commodity prices continuing to show signs of rapid demand growth, the dollar potentially weakening further, compensation here firming a bit, and productivity growth probably staying a bit below what we thought was trend.  In this context, with inflation still running about 2 percent, inflation expectations could drift up. Continuing on the risks for a bit, I still think we live with a significant risk of a sharp deterioration in financial markets.  Credit spreads, other risk premiums, low levels of implied volatility, and the strength of asset prices in many parts of the world—all imply a level of confidence in ongoing, stable growth and low inflation that seems a bit implausible.  In addition, the low level of long forward rates seems hard to reconcile with the strength of demand growth outside the United States, suggesting that much of the world is likely to need to move further toward tighter monetary policy.  As financial conditions exert more restraint on demand growth globally, we could see a rapid unwinding of this long period of very benign assessment of fundamental risks.  We, of course, face some risk of policy actions here in the form of trade or investment protection.  This risk, against the backdrop of some uncertainty about the strength of productivity growth going forward, might make the rest of the world less comfortable financing our still-large external balance on the favorable terms that have prevailed thus far. On the longer-term outlook for potential in the United States, we are sticking with our forecast of 3 percent, but we have altered the mix a bit, just as the Greenbook has in some sense; however, we feel a little less comfortable with our basic view about potential.  We lowered our productivity growth assumption a bit, to 2.25 for the nonfarm business sector, and raised our estimate of trend hours a bit.  If potential is lower than we’re assuming, then we are less likely to see the moderation of inflation that we currently expect, but we would expect a lower path for output growth as well.  At this stage, however, in view of the strength in income growth that we’ve seen, earning expectations, and other measures, we’re reluctant to embrace a more negative view about growth in potential. On balance, in view of these risks, I favor staying where we are for a while.  I don’t think there is a very strong case for tightening policy or for inducing a significant rise in market expectations about the path of the fed funds rate going forward, nor do I think now that we’re at risk of being too tight.  So, in general, I think the best choice for us is to continue to lean against the expectation that we will move to reduce rates soon.  Thank you."

Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you, and thanks to everyone.  Let me try to give a quick summary, and if I misrepresent you, please let me know.  Participants’ expectations for growth were varied, but most people expect to see strengthening over the remainder of this year and into 2008 and 2009.  The principal source of downside risk is housing, which remains weak, perhaps in part because of problems in mortgage markets.  However, significant spillovers have yet to emerge from the housing situation, and other components of demand appear to be strengthening and thereby offsetting the drag from residential construction.  A number of participants referred to the strength of the global economy, which is stimulating U.S. exports but also leading to increases in costs of energy and metals. Investment has picked up from a bit of a pothole and is growing now at a moderate pace with particular strength on the commercial real estate side.  Inventories are mostly aligned with sales and manufacturing seems to be strengthening overall.  Consumption seems likely to grow at a steady but not exuberant level, with factors such as gasoline prices and slower house appreciation creating some drag but strong employment and incomes acting as supports.  Indeed, the labor market continues to be strong, although there are some measurement issues that were noted, with unfilled demands for highly skilled workers and with some signs of wage pressures.  Overall, the risks to output seem roughly balanced around the path of a gradual increase in growth. Participants did note the increase in long-term interest rates, which tended to align market policy expectations with those of the Committee.  Higher long-term interest rates and some other changes in financial markets may be slightly restrictive but probably not substantially so.  Some also noted risks in financial markets, including the aforementioned risks associated with the subprime sector, but also more-general concerns about structured credit products and the possible effects of a decline in liquidity.  However, I would note also, as some others did, that a bit of cooling in the financial markets might not be an entirely bad thing. Recent core inflation numbers have been favorable, and most of you see continued moderation in inflation resulting from mildly restrictive policy, the ending of some temporary influences, and slower increases in shelter costs.  However, a few of you have suggested that some of the recent improvement in core inflation is transitory, and they noted upside risks, including resource utilization, possible pass-through from energy and commodity costs, slower productivity growth, and the possible effect of high headline inflation on inflation expectations.  High capacity utilization—and “globally,” President Fisher—is also a source of possible inflation pressure.,   All in all, there still seems to be general agreement that the risks to inflation remain to the upside and remain the predominant concern.  Is that a reasonable summary?  Are there any comments? Let me present just a few essentially random thoughts at this point.  First of all, from my perspective, the biggest puzzle about what’s happening is the behavior of the labor market, which is continuing.  We’ve had slow growth.  Unemployment is at least not falling anymore, but it remains stable at a fairly low level.  My scenario for the soft landing plus some moderation of inflation involves some cooling of the labor market from here.  I still think it will happen, but admittedly, there is only the slightest suggestion so far that it is happening.  In particular, we have not yet seen the decline of construction employment, which I have continually referred to and continue to expect.  There have been a number of discussions about why we haven’t seen that response yet.  Some have noted the possibility that a lot of the workers are undocumented and, therefore, are not being counted by the usual measures.  However, they seem to have been counted when the market was expanding.  So it is a little puzzling why suddenly they are not being counted.  Thus I still think there will be some moderate softening in the labor market over the next year.  If that does not happen, then we will be at some risk of higher upside growth than we anticipate and higher inflation pressures than we anticipate.  So for me that is a central thing to look at.  I think in talking about this, it is important to note how uncertain we are about what the natural rate of unemployment is and that entire concept.  Judging from the FOMC’s 2009 projections, most of us think that the natural rate may be a bit below 5 percent, and I would note that the unemployment rate was in the mid to low 4s for four years in the late 1990s and has been in that range now for about two and one-half years.  So it is not entirely evident where the natural rate is, and it does make some difference obviously.  Again, I expect to see some moderation in the labor markets, and I believe that is critical to our scenario. Like everyone else, I think the housing situation continues to involve downside risks.  I would reiterate what President Poole said—that this is an asset market; that therefore price changes are inherently, at least to some extent, unpredictable; that a lot is going to depend on confidence, which is going to depend on results, which is going to depend on confidence; and therefore, that we need to be very careful, just the same as with inflation, about declaring victory too soon on the housing front.  In particular, there is an interaction between the mortgage market and financial markets.  There has been discussion of that already today, but there is the potential for some trigger to lead to what would amount to an effective tightening in financial markets, which would affect not only housing but also potentially, for example, corporate credits.  Although that remains just a risk, I think it’s one we need to keep in mind. I agree with the general view around the table that, except for housing, the economy looks to be healthy.  Capital spending is not going gangbusters, but it does seem to have come back to some modest trend.  I also agree with what a number of people said about the strength of the world economy.  We shouldn’t get too carried away with the export sector. What we’re hoping for here is that net exports will not be a net drag on growth.  [Laughter] Nevertheless, that is an improvement over the past, and the strong world economy should on net be helpful to our economy. Like everyone else, I’m encouraged about the incoming inflation data.  I agree that some of these good numbers may be partially transitory.  However, when you analyze this, there has been a decided step-down in the past three or four months in the shelter component.  I would make two observations.  One is that, excluding shelter, core PCE inflation is now at the lowest number since the end of 2003; if the shelter numbers of the past three months were to persist, then that would automatically arithmetically give us some additional progress on inflation.  Now, that may not happen.  Clearly we have month-to- month variations, as we have mentioned many times; but I think some slack could combine with some more moderation in rents.  On the inflation expectations issue, I thought David Wilcox’s graphs were very instructive.  I do very much believe that inflation expectations influence actual inflation and that the anchoring of inflation expectations is very important. But I don’t think they’re anchored at 2.000; I think that they’re anchored at a general range somewhere around 2 percent.  What David’s graph showed was that the level of expectations that we observe seems also to be consistent with 1.8 or 1.7.  So I don’t think that’s an absolute barrier, though I concede that expectations play an important role.  Two, I would also just comment about the statistical issue.  I was among a number of people who talked about the statistical significance of the change in inflation that we have seen and noted that these month-to-month changes are subject to a lot of variable shocks.  But let me just say that I think it’s probably worth noting that, in the classical statistical significance tests and everything we’re doing here, we’re Bayesian decisionmakers, and we’re trying to make a decision based on our best estimate of where we are at a given moment.  Even if we concluded that inflation’s decline is not statistically significant in a classical sense, we still ought to act as if there has been some decline in inflation.  As a thought experiment, I would ask what we would be saying now if we had gone up 0.6 percentage point from where we were in May.  I think that would have led to a somewhat different tone around the table.  So while acknowledging the statistical variability and the transitory nature, I think that there has been some improvement and that it is showing through into our thinking about the economy. One last thought—a number of people have mentioned the distinction between core and total inflation.  I agree that our communication on this issue really needs some work.  I was just in Chicago, and several people, including directors and employees, asked me, “Don’t you guys drive?  Don’t you eat?”  [Laughter]  Clearly, we understand why we do this, but I think we need to improve our communication on that particular front.  That’s a little segue into what we’ll be talking about tomorrow.  So if you will bear with me—I know it is six o’clock, but I’d like to ask Vincent just to give us a brief introduction to the monetary policy discussion we’ll be having tomorrow.  That will save us some time tomorrow and give us a chance to think overnight about the subject."
"345";"GOVERNOR KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"   Is President Fisher a source of inflation?  [Laughter]"
"346";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, for the sake of consistency, I will refer to my report at the last two meetings on what I call the Goldilocks porridge classification system.  I reported last that the international economy was hot, and it remains so as we saw in the excellent slide presentation.  I reported that the domestic economy was cold.  I believe it remains so, in contrast I think to the previous two interventions, at least from a growth perspective.  I also reported that the Eleventh District, home of the NBA champions, vanquishers of the—shall I say “more cavalier”?—Fourth District, [laughter] was just right.  It remained so in relative terms.  I would say that it has weakened somewhat and cooled somewhat in absolute terms. I just want to comment quickly on the international side of the domestic economy, with the hopes of adding on the margin to the staff’s excellent work in the Greenbook, the Bluebook, and the presentations we had earlier.  On the international side, I was pleased that for the first time, at least since I have been a member of this august body, the last minutes reported that the participants expressed “some concern that the strength of global demand could contribute to price pressures at home” and noted “heightened levels of capacity utilization in those countries.”  We didn’t talk about capacity utilization in your excellent report.  I just wanted to add that our work in Dallas and my CEO contacts continue to validate the phenomenon that we are getting closer to capacity constraints abroad.  Research by the Dallas staff, imperfect as it is, confirmed continued growth overseas, resulting in a tightening of capacity around the world, as does the work of JPMorgan, one of the few places in the private sector that we find has spent a good deal of time contemplating this issue. Anecdotal reports from CEOs and CFOs confirm this trend.  The rest of the world is reported to be offering more fertile soil for growth and investment, as I think President Moskow pointed out.  Shippers tell me that tonnage demand for dry bulk is running at a rate significantly higher than last year, driven by underlying demand outside the United States and despite slower rates of growth of shipments to the United States.  You also see this in ship charter rates remaining high.  Freight rates, which don’t have a spot market and are much more difficult to measure, appear to be rising in terms of their volume expansion and in shipments to Europe from the Pacific—certainly at a faster rate than those shipments from the Pacific to the United States. One of the largest engineering logistics firms in the world reports that, with the exception of downstream oil and gas investments, power, and an as yet unannounced nuclear power plant that will be built in the United States, their bookings and substantial backlog are “all driven by non-U.S. demand, with cost escalation not only of commodity inputs but of the building blocks and their materials, such as compressors and pumps, and so on, despite the leveling-off of the price of steel.”  On the cost side, the head of the United States’ largest importer of consumer goods—without mentioning the name of the retail company—[laughter] reports that cost pressures, as you indicated before in your presentation, coming from China are leading them to “aggressively seek to shift imports to other country sources; in certain sectors, China is becoming too pricey.” At home, business operators to whom I talked are more equivocal about growth prospects for the economy, Mr. Chairman, than I expected.  The CEO of one of the largest rails describes the economy as “lethargic.”  The CEO of one of the largest IT firms “doesn’t see much sequential growth.”  The CEO of an airline, which is not Southwest Airlines, says that “domestically, the seasonally adjusted revenue for the industry line is flat.”  A usually ebullient CEO of one of the nation’s largest broadcasters said that “while Q2 is always the slowest quarter, this one is slower than normal.”  The CFO of one of the flagship express shippers reports that B2C is growing at 3 to 4 percent rates of volume expansion after several years of 7 to 8 percent rates of growth.  But there has been no pickup in the second quarter over the first quarter seasonally adjusted, and “it just seems to be as flat as it can be across the board in all segments.”  A leading restaurateur with thirty years in the business notes that he is experiencing a combination of soft top line and rising costs for the first time in his history of operating.  For added measure, the CEO of a very large retailer describes demand as “flatter than a pancake.” He and retailers at the higher price points report that shoppers are moving away from the malls to closer-to-home retailers because of transportation costs and financial insecurity. They make fewer trips, and they buy larger volumes per trip. President Yellen, I won’t depress you with the soundings from the two largest public homebuilders.  I only half jokingly recommended that they take all sharp objects off their desks and seal their windows.  [Laughter]  Their situation is reported to have gone from bad to worse.  One of the interesting data points is that they represent 27 percent of the homebuilders.  The remainder is in private developers’ hands.  They suggest that the rapidity with which those private developers report their stress is certainly much less than the publicly held companies, in part because they are afraid of their lenders.  Therefore, those shoes have yet to drop, which is not an encouraging sign. On the price front, I hear two common complaints across the board.  First, labor remains tight and pricey except in the homebuilding sector, where there has been some relief for obvious reasons.  Second—and I think very importantly—food prices driven by corn oil are creating significant cost pressures for all crops, including substitute crops. One of the most astute contacts I have—a leading banker, not a restaurateur or a food person—says that adding ethanol to what he called a tectonic shift in demand for corn, wheat, and other food stuffs stemming from the addition of two billion people—new consumers moving up the food chain (no pun intended)—may place corn at the center of the inflation paradigm in the new century. One commonly voiced concern might influence business investment in capital expenditures.  I keep hearing from each CEO, “What are we going to do with our capital?”  Reports are increasing of competition from rates on the longer end of the yield curve, above 5 percent.  Boards of directors are reluctant to embrace the concept that eighteen months out the U.S. economy’s sun will shine more brightly than it is shining currently, and concerns linger about the costs and the availability of labor for domestic cap-ex purposes. In summary, Mr. Chairman, statistically we may have a second-quarter snapback driven by inventory adjustment as predicted by the Board staff and by my own staff.  But my soundings with business leaders—again, no doubt imperfect—provide some cognitive dissonance.  I didn’t hear a single one of twenty-six interlocutors who would agree with the baseline case as stated in the Greenbook.  Most would agree with the alternative cases that were presented, which were quite thoughtful.  I used the term “dyspeptic” in describing the mood of corporate leaders the last time we met.  I would say the mood, Mr. Chairman, remains sour, and perhaps it has become more sour.  I remain relatively pessimistic on growth and skeptical about inflation and the utility of reliance on the core measurement in guiding our deliberations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   If this were the Australian Reserve Bank, it would be okay. [Laughter],   Only rhetorical inflation."
"347";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  I will spend just a couple of minutes extra on the District this time because, generally speaking, our District economy continues to perform very well despite the weakness in the housing sector.  Energy and agriculture remain very strong, and manufacturing remains generally strong although we have seen some leveling-off of that in the past month.  The strength in these three sectors has helped spur broad-based job growth throughout the District and a significant tightening of our labor markets and their conditions.  Many of our contacts report labor shortages and higher wage pressures.  Demand for skilled labor remains very strong, and some firms have limited hiring plans because of the unavailability of qualified workers.  To bolster recruiting, a few companies have partnered with vocational schools to offer industry- specific training programs to try to fill the gap.  Since our last meeting, hiring announcements, which we try to track, have outpaced layoff announcements by a margin of 6 to 1.  One anecdotal piece of information—we have some fairly large engineering firms in Kansas City that build power plants globally, including in China, and also ethanol plants.  Last year, one CEO told me that they hired 2,100 engineers and were unable to fill 900 positions on a global basis.  So there is a lot of activity going on out there. Construction activity remains mixed, with weakness in residential construction balanced by strength in commercial construction.  On the residential side, we have seen some pickup in sales, but high inventories have limited new construction.  For us, problems with subprime loans are concentrated in Colorado and in a few other areas.  But because of the strength in energy and agriculture, some parts of the region are actually experiencing a housing boom, with strong home-price appreciation.  Relative to the total market, that is small, but it is a rather sharp contrast.  Conditions in agriculture are the best in recent years.  Spring rains have alleviated drought conditions in much of our region.  Strong demand and limited supplies continue to boost farm commodity prices and farm incomes.  However, we are also beginning to see the effects of higher livestock and crop prices on retail food prices themselves.  An additional concern is the sharp rise in land prices throughout much of our District.  First-quarter cropland values in the District rose roughly 12 percent above year-ago levels, and ranchland values have strengthened as well, that much or perhaps a little more.  Our contacts in the real estate industry indicate that some of the recent surge in land prices is speculative in nature, and some District bankers have expressed concern about the bubble in farmland values driven in part by the ethanol boom that we have heard about.  In recent examination reports, our supervision staff have begun to see some increases in nonperforming real estate loans, and that includes some pickup in other real estate owned as well.  These developments are very preliminary, but they are reminiscent of an earlier time, and we are trying to pay a little more attention to that. On the national outlook, data released since the last meeting support the view that growth will pick up over the year.  I have been encouraged by the recent pickup in retail sales and by positive news on employment and personal income.  At the same time, the recent increase in longer-term interest rates, if sustained, is likely to damp growth somewhat in the period ahead.  In particular, the rise in the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate may deepen and prolong the ongoing housing slump.  The combined effects of weaker growth in the first quarter and the rise of long-term rates have led me to lower my estimate of growth in 2007 to about 2.3 percent.  I expect growth of 2.7 in ’08 and 2.8 in ’09.  I now think the risks, perhaps, are roughly balanced.  While the downside risk from housing remains, the outlook for other sectors, as others have reported, has appeared to improve.  Markets seem to have adopted this view as well, as removal of the expected policy easing has contributed to the flattening of the yield curve at this point. In terms of the inflation outlook, recent data have been favorable, with core CPI on a twelve-month basis down to 2¼ percent.  I expect continued moderation over the year.  In particular, if owners’ equivalent rent continues at the slower pace of the past three months, it will help bring down the twelve-month core inflation number over time. Despite these recent improvements, I continue to believe that upside risks to inflation remain.  The possible pass-through of recent energy and food price inflation to core inflation may slow progress toward lower inflation.  In addition, pressures from resource utilization and slow productivity growth, if that happens to be the case, could affect that outlook as well.  Finally, I am somewhat concerned with the recent uptick in longer-term inflation expectations.  We have talked about the TIPS five-year, five-year-ahead breakeven inflation rate; as mentioned in the earlier briefing, it has increased about 20 basis points over the past month.  So in light of these factors, I believe it is important that we continue to signal to the markets that current inflation rates are not acceptable over the longer term.  Thank you."
"348";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My projection was closely in line with that of the Greenbook, modestly below-trend growth for a few quarters, held down by a prolonged weakness in housing.  As that drag abates, the economy picks up to potential and is held back from overshooting that potential by various factors, including the rise in the saving rate and slightly lower growth of government spending. Under these circumstances, core PCE inflation holds in the neighborhood of 2 percent.  I do not really see much to push it one way or another at this point.  The economy is producing very near its potential, as close as we can figure.  Inflation expectations have been moving in a narrow range.  Some of the transitory factors, such as owners’ equivalent rent, that we’re expecting to come down to reduce inflation have already done that to a considerable extent.  So I don’t see them, moving forward, as having a big effect.  Given the limited pass-through of energy and commodity prices into core prices, I would not expect much downward pressure on inflation from a leveling-out of those prices. I think that we are around 2 percent and that we will probably stay there, at least for a little while. In terms of risks, the recent data on capital goods, orders and shipments, and manufacturing activity suggest, as many have remarked, some reduced downside risk from business attitudes on spending.  They do not suggest a great deal of strength in business capital spending, however.  The fundamentals are less favorable than they were a couple of years ago, and the most recent data, which we received today, suggest a pretty flat or a modest upward tilt to capital spending in the second quarter.  The data weren’t that strong, but they do suggest that what I feared in May—that we were in the midst of a cyclical adjustment that was going to make capital spending much weaker—has certainly abated. I agree with many others around the table that housing is a significant downside risk to the forecast, given the high level of inventories despite a major reduction in starts over the past year and the price-to-rent ratio being as high as it is.  The further slide in housing may be gentle, as President Lacker said, but I do not think we’ve seen the bottom yet.  You can go a long way at a gentle slope.  [Laughter]  We also have not yet really seen the full effects of the tightening in subprime credit terms or, obviously, of the recent increase in mortgage rates. I also see a big downside risk from consumption.  The Greenbook has the growth of consumption sustained despite an increase in saving rates as the growth in disposable income exceeds the growth in GDP—and that is with the labor share recovering and the business profit share declining.  I see two downside risks to that.  One is that the saving rate will rise faster as the housing weakness feeds through both in terms of wealth effects and in terms of reduced availability of credit as terms tighten and there is less equity to borrow against, particularly for liquidity-constrained households.  I also continue to see a downside risk to equity prices, although I have certainly been wrong so far.  Nellie’s table presenting the difference between the staff’s forecast of profits and the market’s forecast of profits showed a huge difference for next year.  So though I think the basic outlook is fine, I still see some downside risk on that side. On the inflation front, I, like others, see the better-than-expected core inflation as a hopeful sign; but it is recent and may be affected by temporary factors, and I do not think we need to get too enthusiastic about it.  I do see several upside risks to inflation:  the high level of total headline inflation, which could erode inflation expectations; business resistance to any erosion of profit margins as unit labor costs pick up; the high levels of resource utilization in the United States; and the tighter global conditions of demand on potential supply that others of you have mentioned. Let me say a word or two about my year-three projections.  I projected output growth at 2½ percent, the unemployment rate at 4¾ percent, and core PCE inflation at 1.9 percent.  I certainly saw my output and employment projections as a sense of what the steady state was.  On the unemployment rate, I do think the odds are better that the NAIRU is lower than that it is higher than the staff’s 5 percent assumption.  This judgment is partly based on the very moderate pickup in the employment cost index, and average hourly earnings growth has actually been coming off recently.  On the behavior of core inflation, I don’t see much evidence that we are significantly beyond potential now, although I recognize that, with a very flat Phillips curve, it could be a long time before one figures that out.  But I had growth of potential at 2½ percent, which is below what I infer to be the central tendency of the Committee. Regarding my reading of the decline in productivity growth, productivity over the past five quarters has been growing significantly below the staff’s estimate of 2½ percent. Some of it is cyclical.  There could be a revision, as Presidents Plosser and Yellen have suggested.  I confess to having asked David Wilcox about this at the break, and he said that the data are kind of ambiguous here and that it is much too early to predict a significant downward revision to employment.  But I hope you are right.  Now, some of the recent slowdown certainly must be cyclical, though I would have thought that labor hoarding and things like that would be much less in today’s flexible labor markets, with so much more use of temporary workers than there has been in the past.  I would think that the cyclical effects on productivity would be muted, that businesses would move pretty promptly to adjust their labor forces to output.  So I wonder how much cyclicality there is.  The big uncertainty is in the construction industry and in the fact that construction employment hasn’t come down. We don’t quite understand why it hasn’t come down more.  So perhaps productivity will pick up. But I still would look at the staff’s 2½ percent as having even just a little more downside than upside risk to it, given the fact that we have had more like 1 to 1½ percent in the past four or five quarters.  So I stuck with the staff’s forecast of 2½ percent potential GDP. In some sense, our view of what the potential growth rate is isn’t all that important for monetary policy.  We ought to be looking at the gap.  We ought to be looking at the pressure of the level of production on the level of potential GDP.  But I don’t think it’s quite that easy.  We don’t know what that gap is.  We have seen that the surprises over the past year or two have been in the behavior of the unemployment rate and capacity utilization relative to growth.  So we do tend to look at our estimates of potential growth and the actuals coming in relative to those estimates and pass judgment on what’s happening to the output gap even when the unemployment rate doesn’t move.  We just need to remember that potential growth is an entirely estimated number that we will never observe, and we need to be aware that it might not be quite as high as the central tendency indicates that my colleagues on the Committee apparently think it is.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"349";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  The last time we met, there seemed to be a bit of increased uncertainty about a potential downdraft on economic growth, and now some of that concern about that downturn seems to be no longer there.  Some intermeeting data have come in a little more on the upside, and obviously the markets have changed their expectations and seem to agree with that.  I think the strength in the labor market and in consumption, although facing some challenges, is still at a reasonable level.  It does seem that we are getting some signs that investment is coming back. Recent durable goods numbers, which came out today, perhaps raise some questions of that.  We have had a couple of good months and now a bit more of a challenge.  But when you smooth through, I think, exactly as Governor Kohn suggested, that we’ll have moderate growth going forward, a forecast that I think is consistent with the Greenbook forecast.  Strength in nonresidential construction, as we have heard around the table, has also provided us with a bit more optimism for investment in general.  But investment is obviously closely tied to where productivity is going because, if we don’t have investment, particularly in the high-tech areas rather than just in the construction sectors, it is going to be hard to sustain high productivity growth.  When we get the revised numbers on July 27 and we also get advance GDP, we’re going to get a lot of information about that, and I think there is still a lot of uncertainty as to exactly where productivity is going.  So I will defer my comments until the next meeting because we will have those numbers by then. Regarding consumption, we have been having the offsetting wealth effects of the recently robust equity asset market and much less robust housing asset market, continuing strength in the labor market, and as the Greenbook points out, increasing disposable income because we’re having incomes grow faster than productivity growth, at least right now. That suggests that we might maintain a reasonable support for consumption growth, but again, as Governor Kohn said, there are potentially some challenges here. But now I want to discuss the big challenge that everyone keeps talking about, which is the housing market.  It has become obvious that the transition is going to be quite a long one and potentially a painful one, perhaps more in individual pockets and for individual families than for the macroeconomy.  It will not just disappear after the third quarter of the year or even the fourth quarter of the year.  I would think in four different ways about how housing can have a broader effect on the economy. First is obviously the direct effect on prices.  The Case-Shiller ten-city index suggests that the prices will fall about 3 percent over the next year.  Now, that’s roughly where the market was just before the issues in subprime arose at the end of February, and it is actually better than it was last fall.  So the markets don’t think that there will be an enormous challenge with respect to prices, at least in these ten markets.  But as President Poole mentioned, sometimes the prices even in these improved indexes, like the Case- Shiller index, may lag what’s going on and may not accurately reflect the underlying actual values that people can realize.  So there still may be more challenges even though the index suggests that house prices are down only 3 percent.  It is also interesting to look at the delta, the change in the index.  We haven’t really seen much from that, which I think is heartening, but it is still something that we have to watch out for. Second are the indirect effects, the wealth effects.  As I mentioned, there have been offsetting wealth effects from the equity markets and the housing market.  More broadly, there can be confidence effects on spending and on saving behavior.  So far we haven’t seen a lot of evidence of that.  As Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned, there have been anecdotal reports of challenges in other areas of consumer credit, although so far no real systematic data suggest that.  Even if there is a little movement up, in almost all the typical indexes we use, many of which were mentioned in the briefing, we are at lows or are much lower than usual historically.  So even with the small movement up, there are not necessarily enormous challenges; but these effects also have to be watched. A third very important potential effect of this long transition is a response by us or by lawmakers that could make the transition even longer and more difficult.  As a number of you know—and all of you have been facing pressure on some of these things—we will be putting out the subprime adjustable-rate mortgage guidance that we put out for comment just at the end of February.  Our timing couldn’t have been better for getting that out—we did it just as the problems were becoming more of an issue publicly.  I hope the guidance will be out by the end of this week.  We are proposing guidance that subprime adjustable-rate mortgages have underwriting at the fully indexed rate.  I do not think that’s going to be much of a shock to the markets.  The markets have largely moved there already.  This was true from some early statements by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.  Also, some of the major players who were not underwriting at the fully indexed rate are simply not there anymore— they are bankrupt—and some of the other players who were not doing it have changed their standards.  As we know from the survey of senior loan officers, standards have been rising. That is not to say that it won’t have some effect, but relative to where the market has already moved, the effect is not going to be significant. The other major guidance is for giving a prepayment penalty grace period of sixty days so that people will have at least sixty days before the reset to refinance their mortgage. It’s unclear from the studies we have done at the Board and from looking around how much of an effect that will have on the initial rate or the so-called teaser rate.  It seems that changing their ability to do that from zero to thirty to sixty days is unlikely to have an enormous effect on the teaser rate, but that is something that is uncertain.  There are some states that already outlaw prepayment penalties or have restrictions on them.  There is not a lot of evidence suggesting that it is more difficult to get financing in those states.  Again, these guidelines are untested, but I don’t think they will have an enormous effect on the market, but they are obviously something to watch. As you well know, we have put out an interagency letter suggesting that servicers and lenders work very closely with distressed borrowers to try to work things out and keep people in their homes.  Doing so is in the interest of the people in the homes; it is virtually always in the fiduciary interest of the loan servicer and of the lender.  I think we have been making progress on accounting issues that have been making it difficult for some servicers to do this, and we are working very closely with the SEC and with FASB on some of these things.  We may be making progress in giving comfort to the servicers who want to do some restructurings that would help keep people in their houses and would ultimately be better for the individuals and for the owners of the securities.  We have also had the HOEPA hearings here in which we talked about the potential for rule writing in several areas, such as requiring escrow for taxes and insurance, some regulation or restriction of prepayment penalties, and various other things.  That would be down the line, but again, we are thinking that this is unlikely to have a major effect relative to where the markets have already moved. Fourth and finally, there has been a lot of interest in the effect of subprimes in the housing market not only on the mortgage market but also more generally on the financial markets, as Governor Warsh and Vice Chairman Geithner pointed out.  Fortunately it seems that liquidity is largely being maintained in the mortgage origination market.  There are still fairly robust amounts of subprime and alt-A originations occurring.  They obviously are going to be declining over time because there are fewer being made; but they were at an unusually high level in 2006, and so it’s a natural part of the transition process that they would go down.  There has been a very significant increase in spreads, as has been mentioned by the previous speakers, and there’s much more tiering of risk.  It is not just that the Bs are all the same; it is where they originate.  The markets are looking through the packages to see what’s in them, which is very, very valuable.  Increased volatility and higher pricing in these markets and the higher long-term interest rate will be a bit more of a challenge for people doing refinancing, although we’re now down to about 5.08 for the ten- year, off 20 to 25 basis points from the high of the other week, and so it may not be quite as much of a challenge.  But there is also a legal risk in this market because, if some problems become larger, there could be concern about what the new instrument really means and what you have actually purchased.  If legal risk is there, the markets will start to run away from these things.  Then you may have some severe liquidity problems.  I do not think that we see those challenges yet, but it is one indirect effect on the financial market of some of these issues. Just quickly on inflation—most people have said that we’ve seen some moderation. It is a little too soon to declare victory.  As we said in the initial briefing, when we drill down into the components and look at owners’ equivalent rent, we may get some nasty surprises going forward.  Some numbers have gone down, but owners’ equivalent rent may come back up a bit.  So I don’t think we can say that the temporary elevation in that area has passed and that we can move on.  I think some challenges are still there.  Fortunately, expectations still seem reasonably well contained.  But I think that there may be some challenges going forward as the economy continues to grow at least at a moderate pace, and some of the temporary factors are not necessarily completely behind us.  We still have to look for potential price pressures going forward.  Thank you."
"350";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Fifth District’s economy has picked up since the last meeting.  Retail sales rose briskly in June following several months of flatness, and shopper traffic increased more broadly as well.  Of particular interest, building supply and furniture retailers report better sales.  Big-ticket sales remain generally weak, however, with domestic brand automobile dealers continuing to note soft sales.  Activity at District services firms added to an already healthy pace of growth, with revenues and employment expanding somewhat faster in June.  In May, our manufacturing sector finally joined in the general manufacturing pickup that began a few months back in other regions.  Our indexes for shipments and new orders swung well into positive territory after having spent the entire year well down in the negative region.  This rebound appears to be broadly based, with most industries posting stronger readings. Housing sales and construction remain weak in most parts of the District, though home prices have been more resilient, with very modest gains reported in most areas and lower prices in only a few.  In contrast, the commercial real estate sector appears to be fairly strong, with both leasing and construction looking solid. Regarding inflation, our survey measures suggest that price trends in the services sector remain moderate.  Our manufacturing numbers, however, consistent with President Moskow’s report of anecdotal information, indicate significant price acceleration, on both the product and the input sides. At the national level, the new information on the real economy we have received since the last meeting has been fairly positive.  In particular, I’m heartened by the recent reports on business investment and manufacturing, which appear to confirm our expectations that the softness we were seeing a few months ago would prove to be transitory.  Consumer spending also continues to expand, although not as rapidly as earlier in the year.  Housing, of course, continues to be the main drag on spending, and the most prominent source of uncertainty about the real outlook.  My sense is that the uncertainty is receding, however.  Construction numbers have more or less moved sideways since the beginning of the year, in contrast to the sharp fall we saw in the first three quarters of last year.  So it looks to me as though we’re nearing a bottom in housing activity, albeit a bottom that may slope gently away from the steep cliff we descended last year.  At this point, I think the risk of encountering another cliff has become relatively small. We have also received favorable readings on core inflation for the past three months.  This has brought the twelve-month core PCE number down to 2.0 percent. While this news is good, we should react cautiously, of course.  We have seen several months of favorable data before only to see several months of unfavorable numbers. Moreover, the Greenbook points to a number of special factors suggesting that the second quarter’s better inflation performance is likely to be transitory.  I am inclined to agree with that assessment, and so I think we could well see core inflation rise again. Measures of near-term inflation expectations have not moved much in recent months. They all still point to PCE inflation expectations of 2 percent or so.  Moreover, five-year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation has moved up ¼ percentage point, for whatever reason, since just before our last meeting.  All this makes it hard to be confident that we are going to see a sustained decline of inflation below 2 percent anytime soon. The good news on the real side, however, suggests that we are making progress toward seeing downside risks diminish enough for us to do something about inflation.  Thank you."
"351";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like to speak earlier next time, so I don’t have to give credit to so many of the previous speakers—[laughter] including President Poole, who really said a lot of what I have to say.  There wasn’t much change in the Sixth District economic picture during the intermeeting period, particularly regarding things that are relevant to the national outlook.  So I am not going to devote a lot of time to discussing across-the-board conditions in the District.  My staff’s outlook— and my outlook—for the national economy doesn’t differ much from the Greenbook analysis and forecast, so I also won’t detail small differences between those two forecasts.  The Greenbook outlook reflects the baseline expectation of a diminishing drag on real growth from residential investment.  Since our forecast largely agrees with the Greenbook, we obviously see the most likely playout of the housing correction similarly. However, as suggested in the Greenbook’s first alternative simulation, we may be too sanguine.  I think this is really President Poole’s message about a recovery in the housing sector.  That is to say, the downturn in residential investment will be deeper and more prolonged and possibly involve spillovers.  So I would like to devote my comments, in a cautionary tone, to this particular concern. Credit available for residential real estate purchases is contracting, and the credit contraction, specifically in the subprime mortgage market, has the potential to lengthen the transition period required to reduce housing inventories to normal levels.  This tightening of credit availability, along with higher rates, may affect the timeline of the recovery.  One market of concern is the starter home market.  The subprime mortgage market has been a major credit source for first-time homebuyers—although, as has been mentioned earlier, subprime mortgages are a small portion of the aggregate stock of mortgages.  Subprimes were 20 percent of originations in 2005 and 2006, and if you added alt-A nonprime mortgages, you would get 33 percent of originations in the past two years.  In many suburban areas, like those around Atlanta and Nashville in my District, much home construction was targeted at first-time buyers.  We have heard anecdotal reports from banking and real estate contacts in our region that tighter credit conditions have aggravated the already sluggish demand for homes.  The country’s largest homebuilder—there may be a debate with President Fisher—[laughter] so one of the country’s largest homebuilders, headquartered in Miami, reported on Tuesday a 29 percent drop in homes delivered and a 7.5 percent drop in average prices.  But that is combined with a 77 percent increase in sales incentives.  They attribute their negative sales experience to rising defaults among subprime borrowers and higher rates.  That company’s CEO said that he sees no sign of a recovery, and he provided guidance of a loss position in the third quarter. Because of the major role that homebuilding—and, I might add, construction materials, particularly in forest products—plays in the Sixth District economy and because of some tentative signs of spillover, we will continue to monitor these developments in our District very carefully.  As I stated at the outset, we share the basic outlook described in the Greenbook, but observation of the housing sector dynamics in the Sixth District has raised our level of concern that the national housing correction process may cause greater-than-forecasted weakness in real activity.  If that is the case and inflation gains prove transitory, as suggested in the Greenbook commentary, we may be dealing with a far more challenging policy tradeoff than we are today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"352";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  My view of what has been happening in the economy is that we have been basically going through a rebalancing.  We had a sector that was clearly bubble-like with excessive spending, and now we are getting the retrenchment, which is taking a bit longer than we expected.  But the good news is that we are going through a rebalancing in which we are just moving resources to other sectors and that is actually going much along the lines that we want to see.  The problem in a rebalancing episode is that you are always worried about the risk that is possible because these transitions don’t always occur smoothly.  I think that we were much more worried about that—at least I was more worried—at the previous meeting.  But we have been seeing that the rebalancing is actually going along pretty well.  In particular, although the housing market is very weak, very much along the lines of the Greenbook forecast, it hasn’t surprised us this particular period.  It’s just that it is pretty bad.  But the risks are actually fairly balanced on housing because we do not see it as very strong and that is part of the process of undoing the previous excesses. Another very important thing is that we have not seen any surprising spillovers from the housing market.  As time goes on and nothing really bad happens, we become more confident that, in fact, the downside risk isn’t there either.  We have also seen that the investment sector has been looking a little stronger.  Again, that really did concern me at the last FOMC meeting.  Yet we have had some reasonable numbers; they are not spectacular, but I think the downside risks have dissipated. So the bottom line is that I see the economy as rebalancing and doing it in a fairly good way.  In fact, from a long-run perspective, this is a good thing and not a bad thing. The downside risk has dissipated, and the risks are now quite balanced.  So I am quite comfortable with the Greenbook forecast on this, which is that we have growth somewhat below trend but moving back toward trend, and I see that there has been a shift in a positive direction and the risks are not excessively on the downside but are much more balanced. When I look at the inflation picture, I am in a way pleased with the recent numbers because there is no strong indication that we are far from potential output and, in particular, there is a little indication that the tightness in the economy certainly will be unraveled. According to our forecast, not much is going on in that area, so what’s going on in inflation expectations will be dominant.  I mean, given that inflation expectations have been pretty well anchored around 2 percent, although there is some uncertainty, I thought that we would have a return to 2 percent numbers a bit more quickly than the original Greenbook forecast showed.  I was really pleased because the Greenbook has basically moved closer to the picture that I had all along; so now I’m very comfortable with the Greenbook forecast. In contrast to some other people, I think the risks are pretty balanced.  Now, maybe that is not really different because of the people who have inflation going below 2 percent, and I don’t see that.  So I believe it’s going to be 2 now and it’s going to be 2 for a while unless we make a concerted effort to change inflation expectations.  Then there is the whole issue of how we might go about doing that.  But given the current environment, my view is that risks are fairly balanced.  Other people are saying that there is risk on the upside, but I think that’s because they just have slightly lower numbers regarding where they think inflation will be.  But probably when we look at it from that perspective, it is about the same.  So right now I think the economy is evolving in a pretty reasonable way, and I’m sure we will be surprised in one direction or another in the future.  Thank you very much."
"353";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Seventh District have changed little since my last report.  Overall activity in the District is lagging the nation, mainly because of the continued difficulties of what we now call the Detroit Three, formerly known as the Big Three, [laughter] and their suppliers.  But other sectors of our region are doing better—notably, a number of manufacturers outside autos—and consumer spending is moving forward at a moderate rate. Looking at the outlook for the national economy, the Greenbook baseline forecast has growth recovering to potential and core inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  Our outlook is not much different.  We see growth returning close to potential.  Assuming that monetary policy maintains its slightly restrictive stance, we think inflation will edge a shade below 2 percent by 2009.  That would be a good outcome, and I sure hope we get it. The biggest news since the May FOMC meeting is the adjustment in financial conditions.  The change in fed funds futures brings market expectations into better alignment with what I think will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.  I’m not sure, however, how much restraint we can expect from the increase in long-term interest rates.  As the Chairman heard from our directors last week, the effects can be muted by ample liquidity in the financial markets.  One of our directors, who heads a large private equity firm, says that he does not see much of a change in the lending environment. Financing for even high-risk projects continues to be readily available at quite favorable rates and terms.  Notably, such loans are being made with few covenants and no automatic default triggers. Of course, the housing market remains a risk.  Like the Greenbook, we continue to expect large declines in residential investment through the end of this year, and I remain concerned that builders may need to cut back even more to reduce the high inventory of unsold homes.  Our Detroit Branch director, who is CFO of Pulte Homes, noted that two-thirds of their sales usually occur between the Super Bowl and Memorial Day.  Sales this year in that period were sluggish and relatively unresponsive to price discounting.  Accordingly, he is not looking for a turnaround in housing markets before ’08.  Another director, the head of U.S. Gypsum, agreed that it would be ’08 before we could expect a pickup in housing. With regard to consumer spending more generally, some contacts noted the impact of higher gasoline prices.  A developer of malls and shopping centers downgraded his expectations for the rest of 2007, but he is not overly pessimistic and is expecting retail sales in the second half to remain near their first-half pace.  Both GM and Ford believe that the higher gasoline prices are holding down the overall level of motor vehicle sales in addition to moving the mix of sales away from SUVs and toward cars.  At this point, they believe that higher interest rates are having only a marginal effect on demand. Both are predicting that total light vehicle sales will be about 16.5 million units in 2007. That is the same as the pace predicted by the participants in our annual outlook symposium that we held in Detroit earlier this month. But the rest of the manufacturing is doing better than autos.  Producers of heavy machinery and agricultural equipment continue to report strong demand.  The Chicago purchasing managers’ report, which is confidential until its release this Friday, was 60.2 in June; that reading is down only a bit from its very high one of 61.7 in May.  Some of this strength reflects strong growth abroad, which is fueling the demand for U.S. products, as we talked about during the chart show.  Indeed, I think that there may be some upside risks to the GDP forecast from faster-than-expected export growth.  Labor markets continue to be strong, and we heard the usual stories about selected labor shortages and associated increases in wages.  One exception is the soft demand for temporary workers, but this could be normal for a mature business cycle. Turning to prices, our contacts seem to be a bit more pessimistic about the prospects for inflation.  We heard concerns that higher energy prices would boost transportation costs and that the demand for food stuffs from abroad and the booming domestic ethanol market are pushing up food prices.  In contrast to the anecdotes, the incoming data on core inflation were better than expected.  Our indicator models revised down a tenth or two from the last round; they now have core PCE inflation being about 2 percent this year and next and then edging down to 1.8 or 1.9 in 2009.  Without any meaningful resource slack, this improvement would require a comparable adjustment in inflation expectations, which may be difficult given a prolonged period of core inflation at or above 2 percent.  So I continue to think that the predominant risk remains that inflation will not moderate as expected."
"354";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, the news in the Third District economy has been mixed but, on balance, slightly more positive than the previous report.  The District continues to grow at a moderate pace, and we expect that pace to continue.  The bright spot since our last meeting is a rebound in regional manufacturing activity, which had been flat for the past six months.  In June, the Philadelphia Business Outlook Survey index of current activity rose sharply—18 percentage points—from a level of 4.2.  This is the highest level it has obtained since April 2005.  The index of new orders also showed a sizable jump, and capital spending plans firmed in the survey.  Respondents also expected further improvement in manufacturing activity over the coming months. Job growth in the region, however, was somewhat slower over the past two months compared with earlier in the year, but we really didn’t expect much since payrolls seemed to rise much more rapidly than expected during the first quarter.  Year-to-date payroll growth is running about 0.6 percent at an annual rate.  That rate is slower than the national average but is fairly typical of our region, where population growth is rather flat.  Labor force participation is rather flat as well.  Unemployment rates, however, remain low in our three states, and firms still report having difficulty finding both skilled and unskilled workers. It is no surprise, as everyone has said, that residential construction in our region continues to decline and remains weak.  The value of contracts for residential buildings has fallen more than 30 percent in the region during the first five months of this year compared with last year at this time—but that, we have to remember, was near the peak.  Real estate agents and homebuilders generally report slowing of sales in May.  While the number of existing homes for sale on the market has increased, average selling prices have not changed much.  I would characterize the nonresidential real estate market in the region as fairly firm, although construction is not as strong as last year.  Office vacancy rates continue to fall, and in Center City Philadelphia, they dropped to 10 percent.  They were about 17 percent just around eighteen months ago.  Real estate firms report that overall demand for industrial space continues to be robust and that vacancy rates for this type of space are near record lows in some markets.  Rental rates continue to rise, particularly for warehouse space, and rents are at a record high in those areas.  I take these reports as indications of continued expansion in economic activity going forward. Interestingly enough regarding building, I had two observations from CEOs.  One is CEO of a building supply company that manufactures throughout the United States and has sales of almost $10 billion.  He said that, remarkably, even with what is going on with homebuilding, his sales are holding up very, very strongly and they are doing very, very well this year.  Another CEO, whose company produces products mostly for residential cabinetry and other types of things, one of the largest in the country, says that, while new home sales for his work are way down, they have largely been offset by remodeling activity—people have substituted remodeling for buying a new home. As long as I’m reporting anecdotes here, I will pass on one other anecdote, for what it is worth, about trucking.  I listened to President Fisher and President Poole talk about volumes in trucking.  Just as an observation, an executive who runs a trucking company throughout the country told me that one thing that has happened in trucking is that, rather than shipping boom boxes, they are shipping iPods.  [Laughter]  That is true of a lot of consumer goods.  Instead of shipping large CRT screens, they now ship flat panel displays. So even while the volume of goods is being reduced, gasoline prices are high, and they are laying off truckers and downsizing the volume, the value of what they are shipping has been maintained pretty well.  So he was noting a dynamic of value versus volume here, which I thought was very interesting. On the inflation front in the District, prices for industrial goods continue to increase, but retail price increases have not been widespread.  However, many of our business contacts continue to express concern over rising energy costs and food prices and the effect on their businesses and the consumers.  I interpret this to mean that they continue to be puzzled by our focus on core inflation when they see that overall inflation is what affects the consumer and their businesses, and they seem to doubt core inflation’s value as a policy objective or a measure of underlying inflation.  They may be wrong in that, but it tells me that, if they continue to be confused by how we view core inflation and what we use it for, we might need to improve our communication to the public about how we think about it and why we focus on it. On the national level, I have become more comfortable with the economic situation as the year has progressed.  At our meeting in May, we were beginning to see some positive signs regarding both real economic activity and inflation.  Durable good orders were up, allaying some concerns about the first quarter’s weakness in business investment.  Improved ISM numbers were signaling that the slowdown in manufacturing might be ending; and although housing markets remained weak, there were limited signs of any significant spillovers to other sectors.  Labor markets remained firm.  At that time there were signs that core inflation might be moderating.  As a consequence, I expressed hope that in the coming months those data would be reinforced. Fortunately, from my perspective, those hopes have been largely realized.  Coming into this meeting, we have received more positive news on the economy, and I have become somewhat more confident that the economy is on track to return to near-trend growth later this year as the effect of the housing correction moderates, albeit very slowly.  Indeed, data received to date suggest that we will see a substantial rebound in real GDP growth this quarter, as the Greenbook has noted.  After several months of stagnation, manufacturing activity seems to have picked up, and business fixed investment is moderately strengthened. Labor markets remain firm, and yet in recent quarters we have noted a seeming disconnect between strong labor markets and weaker GDP growth.  However, we now may be getting some hints that this puzzle is more apparent than real, and I want to reinforce the point that President Yellen made earlier in that I think two factors suggest this.  First, from December to May the household survey showed almost no employment growth whatsoever, whereas the establishment survey showed 1.2 percent annual growth during that period.  Second— and again as President Yellen noted—the Business Employment Dynamics report came out. It was only for the third quarter of last year, but it showed about 155,000 fewer jobs created in the third quarter than we thought.  What is important about that report is that it arguably does a better job of tracking the birth and death of firms in the data, and so there is some reason to believe that, while this is suggestive, the payroll employment that we have been seeing may not be as strong as perhaps we thought, and that may make some of this puzzle less of a concern.  Moreover, as President Yellen pointed out, it is also relevant for the longer term because, if employment wasn’t as strong as we thought, productivity is going to end up being higher than we thought, and it will help resolve some of that slowdown in productivity.  So I think there are various hints that that may be the direction that we are headed. In my own forecast, I see slightly more underlying strength and so a somewhat faster return to trend growth than the Greenbook does.  The current stance of monetary policy is maintained.  I see strength in personal income, a strong balance sheet (as we saw earlier today), strong equity markets, and a resiliency already shown by consumers despite the lower home equity values and higher gasoline prices, suggesting that there is probably slightly more momentum in consumer spending than suggested in the Greenbook.  I am modestly more optimistic about the labor market than the Greenbook—modestly, as I anticipate less of a downturn in labor force participation rates than is built into that forecast. The rise in long-term interest rates reflects the market’s upgrading of its assessment of the economy’s strength going forward.  Indeed, as has been noted a couple of times, that uptick in long-term interest rates has been, I won’t say a worldwide phenomenon, but certainly widely spread in many countries around the world, which may be saying that global growth is more stable, predictable, and positive than perhaps we thought. Now, this is not to say that I do not see risks around this growth forecast.  Of course, as everyone else does, I see housing as the biggest downside risk that we face.  There is still considerable uncertainty out there, and I do not want to underestimate the risk.  Housing inventories remain high, and I do not see any strong evidence of pickup in demand.  Despite the problems in subprime lending markets, however, I think the financial sector remains healthy—healthier now than it was perhaps in the early ’90s with the previous housing boom.  I am more comfortable with the notion that there will be no spillovers into other parts of the economy, and thus I have become more comfortable with forecasts of return-to- trend growth in the second half of this year and into ’08. On the inflation front, higher energy prices have led to an acceleration of headline inflation, but there has been some improvement in core inflation measures in recent months. The three-month growth rates in the core CPI and the core PCE have been decelerating since February.  Although these developments in inflation are encouraging, I remain cautious about extrapolating too much from recent data.  During this cycle we have seen periods of deceleration reversed a couple of months later.  Indeed, the Greenbook expects that much of the favorable readings on core PCE inflation will prove transitory.  So I remain concerned that our core inflation rates may not continue their recent drift down.  I would also caution that headline inflation, as I noted earlier, has remained stubbornly high.  Thus, in approaching my forecast, I have assumed that the appropriate policy path was one that would return the economy to steady-state growth and to my inflation target by the end of the forecast period. Given my outlook on the underlying strength of the economy and an inflation goal of 1.5 percent for the PCE, it should not be surprising that my forecast incorporates a slightly tighter policy path than the Greenbook does.  In particular, in my forecast the federal funds rate rises 50 basis points, to 5.75 percent, by early ’08.  As progress is made on bringing down inflation starting in the second half of ’08, the fed funds rate moves down, ending at about 5 percent by the end of 2009.  This policy path reflects my view that, unless we take further action by additional firming or an announcement or both that commits us to an inflation goal that is lower than the market currently expects, which seems to be about 2.5 percent, I believe it will be difficult to sustain an inflation rate that is in keeping with my view of price stability.  I believe this can be accomplished with relatively little effect on real growth in 2008.  My assumption in the model with which I’m working is that, once we begin to raise rates, the markets will quickly recognize our commitment to lower inflation and expectations will move down accordingly, mitigating the real output effects of this modest tightening.  The movement down in expectations could be expedited by the Committee’s explicitly announcing the target.  This view of expectations formation is more heavily weighted to forward-looking elements than to distributed-lag elements of past inflation.  By the way, I want to applaud the staff for their work on inflation dynamics.  I thought it was an excellent piece of work.  I found the discussion very helpful and a step in the right direction, both conceptually and empirically. In any event, the bottom line for my forecast is that I anticipate that the economy will grow just below trend of 3 percent in 2008 and at trend of 3 percent in 2009, and we achieve an inflation goal of 1.5 percent by the end of the period.  Of course, this forecast is based on my desired inflation objective, which may not be representative of other members of the Committee.  If there were a common objective that differed from my own view, then my presumed appropriate policy path might be different.  Given this observation and the lack of an agreed-upon goal, I think we need to be concerned about how the public will interpret these forecasts, but I will save my thoughts on that for the next go-round."
"355";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me talk first about some of the anecdotal reports.  A contact with a large software company suggested that the IT industry is doing fine.  Labor is very tight because technical people are in such scarce supply.  This company is expanding development facilities in China and India.  They are not allowed to import the labor they need, and so they will send the operations abroad. My contacts with transportation industry people get the same information that Richard Fisher is emphasizing.  Movement of goods is just really, really flat.  The over-the-road trucking industry is actually taking down capacity, selling off the older, less efficient trucks.  In the express business, UPS is taking down capacity.  FedEx is more optimistic, probably taking market share.  A contact with the fast food industry says that their business volume is down.  The whole industry is down.  Sales revenues are up a bit, but it is because of price increases.  The casual dining industry is down even more. There is sort of a disconnect here between the overall view of the economy, I think, and the anecdotal reports that come from the movement of goods.  Of course, the most cyclical part of the economy is always the goods part.  The services part is much more stable.  Perhaps what is going on here is simply what is also in the Greenbook’s second-quarter numbers, because the goods part of the economy—consumption—is pretty flat.  I think consumption is only—I forget the exact number—1.6 or something. That is an annual rate.  You have to divide that by 4 to tell you what is actually going on in the quarter itself.  Of course, the housing industry continues to decline.  So maybe these anecdotal reports really are consistent with what is going on and what is in the Greenbook picture.  The Greenbook picture makes a lot of sense to me. Let me talk a little more about housing.  The staff presentation had a point that I want to underscore—that the housing downturn is unlike any other that we have had.  I think the chart went back to 1972, but you could go back before that.  If you look at the housing downturns and the recessions of the 1950s, they were all related to a very standard cyclical pattern.  Interest rates would rise, housing—starts, permits, construction—would start to turn down well before the cycle peak, and then housing would start to recover after the cycle peak as interest rates came down.  The current situation is completely different from that standard pattern.  Here we had a housing boom driven by a period of very low interest rates.  The period really got started when we were holding the fed funds rate at 1 percent.  Then you had a lot of these financial innovations and subprime mortgages that added a sector to the market that hadn’t traditionally been there.  Interest rates came up, housing prices are flattening out, and my concern is that there is a lot more to go.  This is an asset market that does not work anything like securities markets.  It is completely different from the stock market and the bond market. Housing starts and permits peaked in the early part of last year, and the adjustment really got under way.  But if you think about how much of the adjustment is complete—well, there is not much sign that much is complete because the inventory of unsold new houses is close to its peak.  There is no convincing evidence that it is really starting to come down.  We have seen some bankruptcies of builders, but not very many.  A lot of banks—I know from our contacts—are putting pressure on their builders to sell out their houses and pay off the loans.  The same thing is true of “the ground,” as the real estate people like to put it.  Builders are stopping their development of new land for housing developments because they don’t have the financing to support it anymore.  The banks are starting to turn off the credit spigot because these companies are getting pretty close to the edge.  They have laid off a large number of workers, but they have to sell out their inventory.  Still, the number of months’ supply that they are sitting on is abnormally high; it really hasn’t come down.  We also know that prices in this market respond with a very substantial lag to the underlying determinants of prices.  So prices of existing homes are only gradually adjusting, and I think there is probably more of that to go. We know that there will be a lot more resets of these adjustable-rate mortgages. The projections are that a lot more defaults than we have yet seen will occur in that area. So I think that we have a long adjustment to go here.  Whether that will spread into the rest of the economy, I don’t know.  I share the Greenbook estimate that probably there won’t be major fallout, but it seems to me that the risk there is significant.  I just wanted to underscore that point because I think this risk is by far the biggest that we face at this time.  Thank you."
"356";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Regarding the national economy and real growth, it seems to me that recent developments are unfolding to a considerable extent largely as anticipated.  Growth was positive but subdued over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this year.  It apparently snapped back discernibly in the current quarter, and my forecast is for sustained growth around trend going forward.  In examining the twelve-month period spanning the last three quarters of last year and the first quarter of this year, it is apparent that the slowing of aggregate demand went beyond the housing sector and, in fact, was fairly broadly based.  To be sure, residential construction activity contracted persistently and substantially over those four quarters.  In addition, spending on equipment and software barely advanced, federal government outlays were soft in real terms, and there was a significant inventory correction.  In most cases, with the likely and perhaps obvious exception of residential construction, there are reasons to believe, based on some of the indicators that David Wilcox covered this afternoon as well as materials distributed before the meeting, that these components of demand—that is, spending on equipment and software, federal government outlays, and inventories—will strengthen going forward.  I thought it was particularly heartening, as noted in Part 2 of the Greenbook, that apparently the inventory overhang in construction supplies and in autos has been worked off, which suggests that we should see improvement in those sectors going forward.  As I have commented before at recent meetings, I think the outlook for nonresidential construction, for net exports, and for consumer spending remains positive, although not unduly exuberant.  All of this fits reasonably well with my view of what we should expect from productivity gains going forward, as well as increases in employment and hours worked.  So, overall, I think the outlook for the real economy is promising and favorable. As to inflation, there has been, as everybody has noted, some moderation in the core measures recently.  I expect this performance to continue, not necessarily on a month-by-month basis but over time.  Overall, my reading of monetary policy is that it is moderately restrictive.  As a consequence, that should feed into a further, gradual diminution of inflation along with ebbing of some of the transitory factors that pushed it up for a time.  I would add that anecdotes from our business contacts don’t suggest any changes in pricing power or acceleration of inflation at this point. Now, of course, risks to the outlook abound, as they always do, and many have already been mentioned.  Several relate, of course, to housing—construction activity, home prices, mortgage-related paper, and so forth.  Then, you can add uncertainty associated with energy prices, the run-up in long-term interest rates that has already occurred, and I am sure a few things that I haven’t enumerated.  I wouldn’t want to sound overly complacent or sanguine, but I would observe that many of these risks are not new. Many of them are already built into the Greenbook or other forecasts.  In any event, if one of them were to occur in isolation, I would doubt that it would have a profound effect on the outlook that I have described.  Thank you."
"357";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Regarding overall economic growth, my own macroeconomic views are not inconsistent with the central tendency of the projections that were pulled together for this meeting.  I think the staff and the participants around the table deserve significant credit for being stubborn about the moderate-growth hypothesis while markets have been on all sides of it.  The markets appear ready to look through the second-quarter GDP growth number, which appears to be a bit above trend.  I’d say that we have gotten some credit from the markets for being stubborn and stubbornly right on our economic forecast, but they certainly haven’t given us their proxy, and I would not expect them to do so.  They happen to share our views for now is what I would say, and I wouldn’t expect that situation to remain over the forecast period.  Again, neither should our intention be to somehow get these curves to match over the coming several quarters. On the inflation picture, though it has improved a bit—and I am trying not to disregard very good news—I must say that it strikes me as thoroughly unconvincing.  To me, inflation, in our old statement language, remains the predominant risk.  I am less certain that core will continue the recent trend.  I do believe that headline inflation may be telling us something in terms of secular trends around energy and food that we can’t dismiss, and the warnings from some of the other signals that we would see as rough proxies for inflation are still very real. Regarding what the financial conditions are telling us about growth, it strikes me that, from all the data we have received between our last meeting and this, financial conditions might be as different as any other sets of data that we received.  My view is that financial conditions are still supportive of growth, but somewhat less so.  It is hard to determine at this point how much, but let me take a stab at doing just that.  Since we last met, as Bill said at the outset, we witnessed ten-year Treasury yields increase on the order of between 30 and 50 basis points.  I am not uncomfortable with that incremental tightening of policy in the financial markets, but we have to be careful of what we wish for.  I think the explanation from our staff here in Washington and Bill and the staff in New York is right, which is that markets have not come to a rosier view of the future.  All they have really done is to take out the downside risk that came out of the first quarter.  As the data came in a bit above expectations, that insurance bet that they had—that we were wrong and would have to cut rates—really lost credibility.  I think their central view of the economy now is not one that roars back but one that is quite consistent with the moderate growth story.  The financial markets have indeed tightened policy somewhat.  Even since the time that the Bluebook was produced last week, spreads have apparently widened in addition to the risk-free rate being somewhat higher.  But this is all happening in very real time, and my report a week ago would have sounded quite a bit different from the one today. We have witnessed increased term premiums and greater volatility across many, if not all, financial markets.  Both the MOVE index for Treasuries and the VIX for equities are high relative to the averages of the past year but are still fairly reasonable over a somewhat broader period—say, the last five years.  Term premiums I would characterize as returning to more-normal levels—but, again, not out of line with history. We have seen in the Bluebook that credit default swap (CDS) spreads and other spreads had widened, but that yet hadn’t happened in the high-yield market, where apparently there was some narrowing of spreads.  That has changed rather dramatically in the past four or five trading days.  I’m sure Vince will share more information on this tomorrow.  But the CDS spreads really occurred first; then there was a lag to high-yield spreads.  In the past two weeks, investment-grade CDS spreads have widened about 7 basis points, high-yield CDS spreads have widened about 20; a relatively new index of loan CDS spreads has widened about 65 basis points; and most, if not all, structured products, even assets wholly unrelated to the housing markets, have been undergoing some spread widening.  As I mentioned, high-yield spreads appear to be catching up to CDS spreads, and with the incredible flow of deals in the market, I would guess that the trend continues. We’re seeing higher financing costs and slightly tougher terms for LBOs; the latter is a remarkable new development.  M&A prices, probably for the first time since I have been sitting at this table, appear in the markets to be coming off their levels.  So when auctions for properties of publicly traded companies are occurring, the price between initial indications of interest and final bids for the first time may actually be coming down. Why is that?  Interest coverage ratios cannot go much below where they have been in this cycle.  It is 1.2 or 1.3 times, but again, as the risk-free rate has gone up, as spreads have widened, you can buy just a little less debt for that.  As a result, equity players that do not want to compromise their equity returns can pay a little less for these properties. Whether this phenomenon is very short term, like the phenomena we heard about after the tumult in late February and we returned to in the heady days of the capital markets, I do not know.  This may just be a temporary preference shift toward quality and toward higher volatility and a return to the “glory” days, but I tend to think not.  It is a tough call, and I reserve the right to change my judgment. I think that the new supply that’s coming into the markets, most of which needs to get priced before the markets slow down in August, will test the markets’ resilience, will test prices, and will test terms.  Up to this point we have seen very little reduction in liquidity, but we are seeing a few deals being pulled from the market.  Pricing power appears to be coming back to investors, and negotiations around prices and terms seem significantly more balanced than they have been in a very long time.  Some of the instruments that we have sort of giggled about around this table—the pay-in-kind notes with optional cash payment— seem to have lost some traction in the market in the past week.  I do not know whether they will return, but I take this new discipline in the markets as an encouraging sign.  So what is going to be the resulting effect on prices, terms, and conditions?  That is something we will have to judge; but financial conditions, as I said at the outset, are perhaps somewhat more restrictive than they were, but they should still be quite supportive of growth. At the outset I talked about the risk on the inflation front.  Let me build on a couple of remarks that Vice Chairman Geithner made about risks now in the financial markets.  If the problems that we have seen around structured products that have come out of the Bear Stearns scenario are really about the subprime markets and subprime collateral and housing, there’s not much to worry about.  But to the extent that the story is really about structured products—products that have not been significantly stress-tested—then there is a risk that the financial markets may react and overreact.  That scenario will bring up reputational risk issues.  Even financial intermediaries that are in the agency business are relearning the lesson that agency business is not free—that there are, in fact, dissynergies from being in the principal investment business and the agency business under one marketing name.  We are learning a lot about what the markets believe about the transparency of prices, particularly in times of financial distress.  Of course, in times of distress, the correlations among all these assets do not look as they do in models, and that is something that will play itself out.  I think that Tim rightly referenced the role of gatekeepers in the credit agencies, who I suspect are going to have a fairly rude awakening over the next six to nine months.  As I also said, regarding this financial innovation, which on net is of great benefit to us, we will really see some of the products tested.  Along with the products, moreover, the market participants’ behavior will be tested, perhaps in this upcoming period, as never before.  So the financial markets are a friend on this, but there is greater risk than there was when we last met.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"358";"MS. MINEHAN.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The pace of growth in New England, at least as measured by employment, remains below that of the nation.  Indeed, since the trough of the last recession, New England’s jobs have grown at less than half the pace of the nation as a whole.  Some of this is the traditionally slower pace of job formation in the region, and some is undoubtedly the result of the kind of industries— telecommunications and technology more generally—that were hardest hit in the 2001 recession and have yet to recover fully.  But some of it also revolves around issues of supply.  Almost every firm, large or small, comments on the difficulty of finding skilled labor.  There is also reason to believe that, at least relative to the rest of the nation, the supply versus demand imbalance may be a particular issue in the region.  This comes from the Conference Board’s online job-posting measure, which for some time has shown New England as having the highest number of advertised job openings relative to the size of the labor force.  Contacts report that they are willing to offer—and do offer— higher pay to get the skills they need, but finding the workers is harder to do and takes longer than earlier in the cycle. Another issue that came up again in our round of contacts is the pervasive rise in the cost of almost any metal, but especially copper and aluminum.  Contacts at one very large diversified company speculated about China’s stockpiling valuable metals. Whatever the cause, worldwide demand is strong, and prices are rising for all types of metal inputs.  Some firms report progress in passing on those price increases.  Indeed, larger manufacturing companies appear to be buoyed, if not driven, by strength in foreign markets.  One firm reported that their booming aircraft business required such long hours and continued stress on skilled workers to figure out ways to meet demand that employee turnover had tripled.  Not surprisingly, year-over-year manufactured exports for the region rose in the first quarter. Elsewhere, news in the region has been fairly positive, with business confidence rising and commercial real estate markets good and improving throughout.  Residential real estate markets remain slow.  Regardless of what measure is used, the region’s home prices appear to have slowed more than the nation’s.  However, although we had led the nation—this is not something in which you want to lead the nation—in the rate of rising foreclosure initiations, especially for those related to subprime mortgages, the pace of this growth has subsided.  Indeed, initiations of subprime foreclosures went down in the region most recently.  Moreover, in the most recent data on home sales, the Northeast was a bright spot.  I have speculated before that the New England residential real estate market could be bottoming out.  Such thoughts may remain in the category more of a hope than a certainty, but perhaps the pace of decline is slowing.  Finally, while consumer confidence has been bouncy recently, probably from concerns about gasoline prices, demand seems reasonably strong as gauged by local retailers.  Software and IT firms are showing considerable strength, and at least in our region, so is temporary help. Coincident indicators of regional health also show solid growth for all six states.  In sum, the region appears to be doing fairly well; and except for residential real estate, there are perhaps growing signs of price and resource pressures, in that regard not unlike the nation as a whole. Turning to the nation, I was pleased to see that incoming data validated the substantial pickup in second-quarter growth that we, along with the Greenbook, had forecasted.  Indeed, outside of residential investment, incoming data have depicted an economy that is growing at a relatively healthy pace.  Data on shipments and orders of capital goods have improved, consumer demand seems relatively well maintained despite high gas and soft home prices, and payroll data show little sign of dwindling labor demand.  Markets have at last decided to adopt the Committee’s more positive outlook on economic prospects, and credit was repriced as a result.  I view this event as healthy.  It has tempered our GDP forecast slightly, but the continued ebullience of equity markets is an important offset.  As I noted at our last meeting, we find ourselves a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook about trends in residential real estate, based on new housing starts and data on new home sales most recently, and we have moderated the pace of decline of residential investment for the second quarter just a bit relative to our May forecast.  The April value of nonresidential construction put in place was a clear positive as well.  The health of the rest of the world continues to surprise, and we, like the Greenbook, expect little drag from net exports over the forecast period. Turning to projections for 2008 and 2009, the factors shaping our outlook haven’t changed much.  We continue to see output accelerating mildly as the housing situation moderates and more of the underlying strength of the economy shows through.  This is tempered a bit both by rising long-term interest rates and by our expectations that consumers will mend their ways a bit—consume less and save more.  This hasn’t shown signs of happening yet.  By the end of 2009, GDP is about at potential, unemployment has ticked up a bit but remains below 5 percent, and core inflation moves down gradually to 2 percent—again, not much change and certainly within the central tendency of members’ forecasts.  One obvious risk to this forecast lies in housing, as everybody has said.  But as I noted at our last meeting, the longer there are no obvious spinoffs from the subprime problem to the wider economy, the more that particular risk seems to ebb. Indeed, as we have yet to see the saving rate pick up with the moderation in consumption over what would be expected by the fundamentals, there may be some upside to growth. Pressures from abroad—worldwide expansion of somewhat larger size than we expected—do raise some upside issues, both for growth and for inflation. On the inflation side, it is true that the April and May core data were encouraging. However, those numbers were dominated by temporary rather than permanent effects, at least in our view.  So we haven’t moderated our forecast of core inflation, as have the Greenbook authors, albeit they moderated it only in a very minor way, and I remain concerned about upside risks.  Headline CPI inflation has been strong.  The unemployment rate and widening concerns about input costs suggest that pressures to raise prices might have grown, and strong growth worldwide affects not only input prices but the value of the dollar as well.  If anything, since our last meeting, I think that risks related to growth have abated and have become more balanced and risks regarding inflation have grown.  Thus, as we look over the next two and a half years, our forecast sees policy staying somewhat restrictive given the inflation risks and then easing a bit in late 2008 or 2009 to a level closer to its equilibrium rate. Finally, continuing some thoughts I began to articulate at our last meeting, as we think about policy, we also need to be concerned about financial stability.  This is particularly true given what we’ve seen in the markets for credit derivatives.  We’ve talked before about how high levels of liquidity and low interest rates worldwide cause much reaching for risk, much reaching for return, and related risk-taking.  While the Bear Stearns hedge fund issue may well not have legs, the concerns regarding valuation of the underlying instruments do give one pause.  Can markets adequately arrive at prices for some of the more exotic CDO tranches?  What happens when the bottom falls out and positions thought to be at least somewhat liquid become illiquid?  Is there a potential for this to spread and become a systemic problem?  Maybe not, and I am not advocating our taking any action as a central bank.  But I do think the size of the credit derivatives market, its lack of transparency, and its activities related to subprime debt could be a gathering cloud in the background of policy.  Thank you."
"359";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  News from the Fourth District is little changed from my last report.  The District economy continues to be weighed down by weakness in the housing market, and there is general consensus among my contacts that the housing sector has not yet seen bottom.  To date, adverse spillovers from housing to other sectors of the economy have not been observed, although this remains a significant risk to the outlook. While I have heard some reports from my business contacts that the labor market is strengthening, the official data still do not show net employment growth in the region. My projections for the national economy still call for growth to resume to a more typical expansionary pace as we move beyond 2007.  My projection for GDP is slightly stronger than what is seen in the latest Greenbook because of my assumption for slightly stronger growth in potential.  Obviously, I don’t make that judgment with great confidence. However, the business leaders I talk with tell me that their plans to expand capital are consistent with a pickup in productivity growth from its recent cyclical low.  This includes the Cleveland Cavaliers—[laughter]—a franchise which, as many of you know, experienced a substantial productivity shortfall against the San Antonio Spurs a couple of weeks ago.  [Laughter]  Here, too, we are projecting a good rebound, so to speak, in 2008.  In the meantime, I would like the record to show that I am making good on my wager with President Fisher.  I brought with me a selection of Cleveland’s finest, and I will present those to Richard after this meeting with my heartfelt congratulations.  I am putting this back, because it feels funny having a beer bottle in my hand.  [Laughter],   I also extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Spurs on their fourth and final NBA championship.  [Laughter]  Now, turning to inflation, I am hearing reports of upward price pressures across a handful of industrial commodities, and notably for metals.  But wage pressures remain modest.  Nevertheless, for the first time in more than a year, I am hearing from my business contacts that they are concerned about inflation.  They are bringing inflation concerns up with me, and they are telling me that they concur with the Committee’s assessment that inflation remains a risk.  To be sure, there were many positive signs in the May CPI report.  The traditional core CPI beat expectations, and while the trimmed mean estimators that we produce in Cleveland were a little higher than the measure excluding food and energy, even those indicators were consistent with the moderation and the longer-term inflation trend we expect to see. Looking at the core measures enables me to be encouraged by the May CPI report.  But that view is a rather hard sell to a public that saw headline CPI inflation rise 8½ percent at an annualized rate last month.  Indeed, our readings of the underlying inflation trend and what people are feeling in their wallets have been at odds for many years now. I understand that our policies are not well advised or even equipped to address transitory price movements.  But at some point, large and persistent price disturbances, such as we have seen in energy markets, warrant our attention.  If these isolated price pressures become more generalized and enter into consumer and business decisionmaking, we could easily find ourselves living in the Greenbook’s “drifting inflation expectations” scenario. In summary, I think the housing market still presents a risk that the economy may not resume a more typical growth trajectory over the forecast period.  Nonetheless, that concern is trumped by the risk that we may yet lose the public’s confidence that we are making sustainable progress against inflation.  Therefore, I continue to believe that the predominant risk going forward is that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"360";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Data relating to both economic activity and inflation during the intermeeting period have been encouraging.  Economic indicators have strengthened considerably, and recent readings on core inflation have been quite tame.  Although a portion of the recent deceleration of core prices likely reflects transitory influences, the underlying trend in core inflation is still quite favorable. I view the conditions for growth going forward as being reasonably solid.  The main negative factors are tied to housing.  The latest data don’t point to an imminent recovery in this sector, and I fear that the recent run-up in mortgage rates will only make matters worse.  In addition, housing prices are unlikely to rise over the next few years and, indeed, may well fall, and the absence of the housing wealth gains realized in the past should damp consumption spending.  I agree with the Greenbook that the recent run-up in bond and mortgage rates reflects primarily a shift in market expectations for the path of policy and, therefore, implies only a small subtraction to my forecast for growth in 2008. In my view, the stance of monetary policy over the next few years should be chosen to help move labor and product markets from being somewhat tight today to exhibiting a modest degree of slack in order to help bring about a further gradual reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability.  The stance of monetary policy will need to remain modestly restrictive, along the lines assumed in the Greenbook and by markets, in order to achieve that goal.  My forecast is for growth to be around 2½ percent in the second half of this year and in 2008, slightly below my estimate of potential growth, and for the unemployment rate to edge up gradually, reaching nearly 5 percent by the end of next year. Under these conditions, core inflation should continue to recede gradually, with the core PCE price index increasing 2 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 2008.  This forecast is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations and the eventual appearance of a small amount of labor market slack.  In addition, special factors such as rising energy prices and the sustained run-up in owners’ equivalent rent that have boosted inflation should ebb over time, contributing a bit to the expected decline in core inflation. In terms of risks to the outlook for growth, I still feel the presence of a 600-pound gorilla in the room, and that is the housing sector.  The risk for further significant deterioration in the housing market, with house prices falling and mortgage delinquencies rising further, causes me appreciable angst.  Indeed, the repercussions of falling house prices are already playing out in some areas where past price rises were especially rapid and subprime lending soared.  For example, in the Sacramento metropolitan area east of San Francisco, house prices shot up at an annual rate of more than 20 percent from 2002 to 2005.  Since then, however, they have been falling at an annual rate of 3½ percent. Delinquencies on subprime mortgages rose sharply last year, putting Sacramento at the top of the list of MSAs in terms of the changes in the rate of subprime delinquencies. Research by my staff examining metropolitan areas across the country indicates that the experience of Sacramento reflects a more general pattern.  They found that low rates of house price appreciation, and especially house price decelerations, are associated with increases in delinquency rates even after controlling for local economic conditions such as employment growth and the unemployment rate.  One possible explanation for these findings is that subprime borrowers, especially those with very low equity stakes, have less incentive to keep their mortgages current when housing no longer seems an attractive investment, either because prices have decelerated sharply or interest rates have risen.  These results highlight the potential risks that rising defaults in subprime could spread to other sectors of the mortgage market and could trigger a vicious cycle in which a further deceleration in house prices increases foreclosures, in turn exacerbating downside price movements. The risks to inflation are also significant.  In addition to the upside risks associated with continued tight labor markets, a slowdown in productivity growth could add to cost pressures.  Although recent productivity data have been disappointing, I expressed some optimism at the last meeting about productivity growth on the grounds that at least some of the slowdown appeared to reflect labor hoarding and lags in the adjustment of employment to output, especially in the construction industry.  Data since that meeting have reinforced my optimism concerning trend productivity growth.  In particular, new data in the recently released Business Employment Dynamics report suggest that productivity growth may have been stronger than we have been thinking. This report, which includes data that will be used in the rebenchmarking of the payroll survey in January, shows a much smaller increase in employment in the third quarter of 2006 than is reported in the payroll survey; it, therefore, implies a larger increase in output per worker. A second risk to inflation is slippage in the market’s perceptions of our inflation objective.  Although inflation compensation over the next five years is essentially unchanged since our last meeting, long-run breakeven inflation rates implied by the difference between nominal and indexed Treasury securities are up about 20 basis points. However, our analysis suggests that this increase reflects in good part an elevation in risk premiums or the influence of various—let me call them “idiosyncratic”—factors of the type that Bill Dudley mentioned, such as a possible shift in the demand by foreign central banks for Treasuries or special factors affecting the demand for inflation-indexed securities and not an increase in long-run inflation expectations.  We base this conclusion on the fact that long-run breakeven inflation rates have also climbed in the United Kingdom—a country where inflation expectations have been remarkably well anchored over the past decade and where inflation has been trending downward.  The fact that breakeven inflation rates rose in both countries, despite their different monetary policy regimes, suggests that a common explanation is needed rather than one specific to the United States.  I think this conclusion is supported by the Board staff model that attributes about half of the movement in breakeven inflation to risk premiums.  That said, our understanding and estimates of risk premiums are imprecise, so we must continue to monitor inflation expectations very carefully—of course, along with everything else. [Laughter]"
"361";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070628meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The outlook looks a little better, I think.  The United States looks okay, and the world looks very strong. Housing here seems as though it will get worse before it gets better, but the rest of the economy seems to be doing reasonably well—with output and investment spending perhaps a bit firmer than we thought they would be and employment growth and income growth looking reasonably good. We have not significantly changed our central projection.  We still see an economy growing around 3 percent over the forecast period, about our estimate of potential, with core PCE inflation falling just below 2.  This assumes a path for the nominal fed funds rate that is flat for several more quarters, essentially the same as in the Greenbook and in the market now.  The risks to this outlook, though, have changed.  We see less downside risk to growth but still believe the risks to our growth forecast are weighted toward the weaker outcomes. Although the recent inflation numbers have been good, they probably exaggerate the moderation of underlying inflation, and we see, therefore, continued upside risk to our inflation forecast.  I still think this latter risk should remain our more consequential concern. Relative to the Greenbook, we have a bit more growth because of our higher estimate of growth in the labor force and a bit less inflation, but these differences are small, smaller than they have been, and they do not have significant implications for our views on monetary policy.  The markets’ perceptions of fundamentals have in some respects moved in our direction in the past few weeks.  I say “in some respects” because we need to be attentive to the rise in implied inflation that you see in TIPS.  Our view and the markets’ view of the expansion, the risk to the outlook, and implications for monetary policy have converged. This means that the effective stance of monetary policy is a little tighter than it was. A few important issues going forward:  On the growth front, I still think that the probability of weakness exceeds that of strength.  There is still a significant risk that we will see a more substantial adjustment of house prices, perhaps drawn out over a sustained period of time with greater adverse effects on confidence and spending.  Of course, if employment and income growth stay reasonably strong, the effects of that potential scenario should be manageable.  If not, we will have more to worry about.  I note that some major financial institutions are now starting to report signs of rising delinquencies in consumer credit products outside mortgages such as automobile loans and leases.  This is the first time that I have heard that report in a significant sense, and maybe it is a sign of some vulnerability ahead.  The strength of demand growth outside the United States has been helpful, and we agree with the Greenbook that it looks likely to continue for some time.  But things could be kind of bumpy out there, particularly in places like China, and monetary policy in much of the world is only now starting to move short-term real rates higher into positive territory. On the inflation front, it seems early to declare satisfaction or victory, not particularly because of the recent reacceleration in headline inflation but just because of the role of transitory factors in the recent moderation in core and the rise in breakevens in TIPS. We cannot be fully confident yet that a constant nominal fed funds rate at current levels will deliver an acceptable inflation forecast.  We do not, in my view, need to try to induce right now a further tightening of financial conditions to push core inflation down further and faster.  But we need more time before we can justify shifting to a more balanced risk assessment of inflation or something equivalent, something that would have the effect, for example, of indicating satisfaction with current levels or of suggesting that the risks are balanced around the path of inflation that we see in our central tendency projections. With financial markets, we are at a delicate moment.  The losses in subprime are still working their way through the system.  Rating agencies are likely to downgrade a larger share of past issues, more than they have already.  The marks that people show indicate that both hedge funds and dealers in a lot of this stuff may still have a way to go to catch up with the movement in market prices.  This dynamic itself could induce a further reduction in willingness to finance new mortgages.  You could see pockets of losses in the system, liquidity pressures in hedge funds and their counterparties, and further forced liquidations. It is possible that we will still have a bunch of that effect ahead of us, even if no big negative shock to demand occurs and induces a broader distress in consumer credit.  We could also see it spread to commercial real estate.  We could see a broader pullback from CDOs and CLOs as well, either from a general erosion of faith in the rating models—as Bill said, it is a possibility—or from just concerns about liquidity in those instruments.  We could see a sharp, substantial widening of credit spreads provoked by an unanticipated default or two or just a general reassessment of risk at current prices.  A very large amount of LBO financing that is yet to be closed, distributed, and placed is still working its way through the system. As in the past, we could see a deal or two get hung, the music stop, and that force some broader repricing.  People get stuck with stuff they don’t want to hold or did not expect to hold.  I think we now see more sensitivity in markets about the prospect of a diminished appetite among the world’s savers and central banks to increase their exposure to the United States, or at least we see more sensitivity to the perception out there that the dynamic might be unfolding.  You can see a bit of all this in some spreads, in some reports of resistance to further erosion in covenants, in some reduced appetite for new bridge book exposure to leveraged lending.  You can see it in some changes in margin terms in some instruments vis- à-vis some counterparties.  For now I think it is a relatively healthy, still pretty modest, and quite contained shift toward a more cautious assessment of risk, but these things generally don’t tend to unfold gradually.  On balance, though, I think we are in a pretty good place in terms of policy, in terms of the market’s expectations about policy now, and in terms of how we have been framing the balance of risks to the outlook."

President Lacker.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman.,   Governor Kohn.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you, and thank everyone.  President Lockhart.,   Thank you for the useful discussion.  As usual, I am going to very briefly summarize what I heard.  I will be happy to take any comments on that.  Then I just want to make a few short points.  Again, most of the key points have been made. Most participants expect growth to remain moderate over the forecast period.  Despite lower household wealth resulting from weaker house and stock prices, consumption is likely to continue to grow as labor markets remain strong, real incomes increase, and gasoline prices moderate.  Business investment should also grow moderately, although lower productivity and higher volatility could be drags on investment.  Commercial real estate, in particular, may be slackening, but it retains good fundamentals.  The global economy is strong.  Industrial production is expanding at a reasonable pace.  However, downside risks to growth were noted and perhaps received somewhat greater emphasis than at past meetings.  Most notably, housing appears to have weakened further, with sales of new and existing homes declining and inventories of unsold homes remaining high.  Homebuilders are experiencing financial strains, and there is downward pressure on home prices.  Spillover on consumption spending is not yet evident but is a possible risk. In this regard, developments in credit markets received considerable attention.  On the positive side, the repricing of risk and the reevaluation of underwriting standards seem appropriate.  Liquidity still exists, credit is still being extended, and markets may work out their problems on their own.  A lower dollar and lower long-term Treasury rates also tend to offset financial tightening.  However, higher risk premiums, tougher underwriting, and greater uncertainty may constrain housing and investment spending, leading to broader macroeconomic effects.  In more-pessimistic scenarios, dislocations in credit markets may last awhile and have a more substantial effect on credit availability and costs for businesses as well as for homebuyers. The possibility of contagion or severe financial instability also exists.  Many participants took note of the NIPA revisions and their implications for productivity growth, consumer saving, and unit labor costs.  Meeting participants tend to put potential growth at higher rates than the Greenbook. Views on inflation are similar to those in previous meetings.  Recent readings are viewed as reasonably favorable.  However, risks to inflation remain, including the possible reversal of transitory factors, tight labor markets, the high price of commodities, and higher unit labor costs resulting from lower productivity growth.  In all, the risks to inflation remain to the upside.  That is my summary of what I heard.  I’m sure a lot more could be said.  Any comments? If not, let me just make a few additional comments.  There have been two very important developments since the last meeting.  The first was the downward revision to the NIPA growth numbers.  It’s not obvious yet, of course, how much of that reflects a permanent decline in productivity and how much is transitory.  But certainly the best guess is that some of it is more long term in nature.  I think the main point I’d like to make is that the implications of this downward revision for inflation and monetary policy, except perhaps in the very short run, are not obvious.  The question is, What is the effect of the lower productivity growth on aggregate demand?  We have examples of both types of phenomena.  In the late ’90s, the pickup in productivity growth stimulated a very strong boom working through the stock market, consumption, and investment, so it led to an overheating economy, whereas in the earlier part of this decade, productivity growth picked up again but with weak aggregate demand.  We had a jobless recovery associated with that.  So it remains to be seen exactly how aggregate demand will respond to these developments.  I do think that perhaps that in the very short run, given wage behavior and unit labor costs, if I had to choose, I would say that there is a slight bias toward higher inflation and tighter money.  In the longer run, you would expect to see lower long-term rates because of slower growth. The second issue that has been widely discussed around the table is the financial market. It is an interesting question why what looks like $100 billion or so of credit losses in the subprime market has been reflected in multiple trillions of dollars of losses in paper wealth.  So it’s an interesting question about what is going on there.  I think there are three reasons that the financial markets have moved in the direction they have.  First, there has been a widespread repricing of risk.  That is, obviously, a healthy development, particularly if there is no overshoot, which is a possibility.  But all else being equal, it is restrictive in terms of aggregate demand, and it makes our policy tighter than it otherwise would be.  The second reason for the changes in markets is that there has been a loss of confidence in the ability of investors to evaluate credit quality, particularly in structured products.  There is an information fog, as I have heard it described.  This is very much associated with the loss of confidence in the credit-rating agencies. I think one of the implications of this is that some of the innovations we have seen in financial markets are going to get rolled back.  We are going to see more lending taken out of originate-to- distribute vehicles and put back onto portfolio balance sheets.  So the question is how much effect this adjustment process will have on the availability of credit.  The third reason that I think the markets have reacted as much as they have is concern about the macroeconomic implications of what is happening.  In particular, there is a fear that subprime losses, repricing, and the tightening of underwriting standards will have adverse effects on the housing market and will feed through to consumption, and we will get into a vicious cycle.  That certainly is reflected in the expectations of policy. I am not going to go through all the things that are going on now in the markets.  You have had very good reviews of that.  Obviously, the markets right now are not functioning normally.  Some conduits of credit are simply closed or frozen.  A number of companies are having difficulties with short-term finance, and so, per President Fisher’s comment, we are watching those things very carefully.  We are prepared to use the tools that we have to address a short-term financial crisis, should one occur.  In the longer term, of course, our policy should be directed not toward protecting financial investors but, rather, toward our macroeconomic objectives.  That is very important.  Then the question is what the long-run implications of the financial market adjustment will be for the economy.  I think the odds are that the market will stabilize.  Most credits are pretty strong except for parts of the mortgage market.  But even so there will be notably tighter credit, tighter standards, probably some loss of confidence in markets, and higher risk premiums that will on net be restrictive.  This restrictive effect could come in various magnitudes.  It could be moderate, or it could be more severe, and we are just going to have to monitor how it adjusts over time.  Again, there is a bit of a risk—and tail risk has been mentioned not only in a financial sense but also in the macro sense—that, if credit is severely restricted so that we get feedback from lower house prices, for example, into the financial markets, that situation would be difficult to deal with. Those are the two major issues that people have talked about.  Just very briefly on the overall assessment—on the output side, economic growth looks a little softer to me, mostly because of housing.  There are also some slightly worrying developments in terms of automobile demand, which suggest some weakening in consumer spending.  But there are some strong elements as well.  Also the labor market has marginally softened.  The unemployment rate is about 25 basis points above its recent low; so there has been some movement, and I still expect to see some reduction in construction employment.  So I think there is a bit more softness and there are a few more downside risks to output than at our last meeting.  Like others, I think the recent inflation data are moderately encouraging.  I continue to see risks.  If you’re not satiated with risks, I’ll add one more, which is that if the housing market really weakens and people go back to renting, we could get the same phenomenon that we saw last year, by which rents are driven up and we get an effect working through shelter costs.  So I agree with those who still view the risk to inflation as being tilted to the upside.  If there are no comments or questions, let me turn now to Brian to discuss the policy action."
"363";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, at the past few meetings I have spoken about my District as having strong growth.  I have asked questions about the strength of the growth in the national economy, and I have described the global economy from the standpoint of the way the staff here writes about it and the way we do our own work as “hotter than a $2 pistol.”  Nothing has really changed since my last intervention.  I would note that, unlike President Moskow’s District, our District is unusual on the other side:  We are not experiencing the kind of decline in home prices that is being experienced elsewhere.  We’re suffering from widespread labor shortages, for both unskilled and skilled labor.  We believe that we are seeing significant labor hoarding in our District.  Unemployment is strikingly and historically low in the two major cities of Dallas and Houston at 4.1 percent, in Austin at 3.5 percent, and along the border areas unprecedentedly in the low single digits.  Salaries for accountants in our District are up 5 to 8 percent.  Law firms—I note that there are 1.2 million lawyers in America and 1.1 million people who work in the auto industry from parts to final assembly, which is a statement on our society—[laughter] are raising first- and second-year annual compensation by double digits for their new lawyers.  So there is still price inflation in the service sector.  We perceive, through our discussions with CEOs around the country, that while there has been a net downward movement in the more-robust measurements of price inflation—the trimmed mean—there still are some threats on the inflation front.  For example, the CEO of Wal-Mart USA told me yesterday that, internally, when they evaluate their comparable store measurements, the comps are being driven by inflation, not by volume.  As for the demand for ships—if you read the Wall Street Journal yesterday or from the interviews I have had with large shippers, the bulk carriers are trading at record highs.  The Baltic index is at a record high, driven by exports of iron ore, pulp, and other products to voracious Chinese demand and by the return of exports from China to a voracious European demand.  Container shipments are up 20 percent year over year in terms of European imports. The price pressures being exerted there seem to be invading other areas.  One of the more interesting observations was what has happened recently in terms of the pricing of paper products being led by SCA, which is a European corporation.  Kimberly-Clark and the others have fallen in line.  They are asking for double-digit increases.  So although we are seeing some mitigation of price pressures, I am nonetheless concerned that, given the international dynamics, we still have the potential for price increases and a bit of resistance to what I would like to see. In terms of economic growth nationally, I just want to comment on some things that the staff presented.  I thought the Greenbook was excellent.  I did speak to two of the five largest publicly held builders.  They report that all-in, with incentives, their prices have been marked down an average of 25 to 35 percent from a year ago.  Those are significant numbers.  For example, in the Imperial Valley of California, homes selling for $550,000 to $600,000 have been now marked down to $400,000 to $450,000.  The builder with the most experience—forty years of experience—who has lived through all kinds of cycles is of the strong belief that we are in the second year of a five-year correction.  Like the point that you made, President Yellen, this is of great concern.  So net from the Dallas Fed standpoint, we have lowered our expectation for second-half growth to 2 percent.  We are still concerned, despite the encouragement of marginal movement, on the inflation front.  I’d like to leave the discussion of the economy there and just turn to the previous discussion we had and the references made by President Moskow and President Yellen. This may be a bit harsh, but if you look at the front page of the Wall Street Journal from this morning, I see what I call the “Churchillian maxim” at play, which is, “I shall fare well in history because I shall rewrite that history.”  Whether you use Greg Ip to rewrite the history or you rewrite it yourself, no amount of rewriting of history will exonerate us if we are not prepared for the more-dire scenarios that were presented by the staff.  I would ask that we do some scenario preparation in terms of, should we encounter increased financial market turbulence, what actions we might take to deal with it.  For example, it is not clear to me that a widespread opening of the discount window solves the problem given the structure of what I call “ersatz credit” that is then spread throughout the system.  It’s not clear to me that even dealing, for purposes of the present meeting, with the fed funds rate is the issue because it is not an issue of just pricing in the marketplace.  It’s a structure issue, and it’s a covenant issue.  It’s an availability issue. I started my career, Mr. Chairman, with Herstatt.  [Laughter]  That was not an auspicious beginning.  I lived through the corrections of the S&L market, portfolio insurance, the crashes of ’87, ’97, and so on.  When you sort through them, all of them have a common basis, and that is a search for greater yields or greater return, leverage in order to achieve that return, and some assumption of risk mitigation leading to what I call “rational complacency.”  I believe that’s at play presently.  I agree fully with President Yellen that it presents a significant risk.  However, I want to exercise great caution in interpreting these signals.  I think we have to be extremely careful about what we do and what we say.  Just to show my hand, I would not be in favor of cutting the federal funds rate at this juncture.  I think we have to analyze the language carefully. But my request is that, in addition to our exercise on communication, we take a serious look at the various scenarios that might obtain, so that no one could ever accuse us of being unprepared in case the worst obtains.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"364";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Mr. Chairman, the Tenth District economy overall continues to perform well, with strength in energy and agriculture partially offset by the weaknesses in residential construction.  Developments since the last meeting include some softening in District manufacturing activity similar to that shown in the July ISM survey numbers and in other regional Reserve Bank indexes.  We have also seen a slowing in overall employment growth.  In contrast, consumer spending seems to be holding well in spite of higher gasoline prices.  Indeed, reports from District directors and business contacts indicate a strong summer tourism season with increased air traffic and higher hotel occupancy rates throughout the western part of our region.  The recent slowing in District employment growth has been somewhat surprising to us, given the activity in much of our region.  Since the beginning of 2004, District employment growth has been running around 2 percent, and in the past few months has slowed to about 1½ percent.  Geographically, the slowdown has been most notable in Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, and Oklahoma, and anecdotal information suggests that the slower growth is due more to a shortage of skilled and semi-skilled labor than to any weakening in demand.  This anecdotal information is supported by new regional information on employment costs by the BLS. According to them, recent employment cost increases in these states have been well above increases nationally and in other parts of our region. Construction activity remains mixed, with weakness in residential construction offset to some extent by strength in commercial construction.  Just an aside, when you talk about things that are on the horizon, we are a little concerned about commercial real estate because it is very hot right now and there is a fairly large portion of it on the books of the banks in our region.  On the residential side, there is considerable variation across our region.  In some areas where energy and agriculture are strong, housing activity is actually above normal.  In other parts of the District, however, both national and local developers are experiencing the most difficult conditions in some time.  In most District metro areas, inventories of unsold homes continue to rise, but the rate of increase has diminished somewhat in recent months. Turning to the national outlook, data released since the last meeting support the view that growth will pick up over the year.  Compared with the Greenbook, I am more optimistic about both the near-term outlook and longer-run growth.  Specifically, I think second-half growth is likely to be around 2½ percent.  Growth in 2008 and 2009 is likely to be near potential, which we estimate to be around 2¾ percent.  Housing obviously constitutes the major downside risk to growth over the next few quarters.  I am not yet convinced, however, that recent financial market volatility and repricing of credit risk will have significant implications for the growth outlook.  It is still reasonable at this point to think that the recent volatility will prove transitory, and the repricing of credit risk is, in that sense, desirable.  I am also encouraged by the results of the July senior loan officer survey, which suggests no general tightening of bank credit conditions.  Like the Bluebook, I think that Treasury yields are likely to move back up once the markets feel more comfortable about the state of the economy and credit conditions and realize that policy easing is not likely to be forthcoming.  Although weakness in housing and tighter credit conditions have increased the downside risk to output, I believe that strength in consumer spending, exports, and government spending will help maintain moderate growth in the period ahead. With regard to the inflation outlook, recent data on core CPI and PCE continue to be favorable.  However, I am expecting some pass-through of higher energy prices to temporarily boost core measures over the second half of this year.  In addition, pressures from resource utilization and slow productivity growth remain.  Thus, despite recent improvements, I continue to believe that some upside risk to inflation remains.  Thank you."
"365";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Building on what the Vice Chairman just said, I have been listening in on that Morning Call.  I’ve found it very useful, and it’s certainly an opportunity to ask questions if you have them. My forecast for the most likely outcome for output over the next few years is close to that of the staff—growth a little below potential for a few quarters, held down by the housing correction, and the unemployment rate rising a little further.  Although some recent data for housing, consumption, and capital spending have been a bit to the soft side, we need to view those data against the background of a lower path for potential GDP and recall the tendency we’ve seen over the past several quarters for short runs of data that are a little hotter or a little cooler than we expected.  I think this is sort of what it feels like when the economy is running at about 2 percent. I see a number of reasons to think that moderate growth remains the most likely outcome going forward.  First, as President Stern has stressed from time to time, is the natural resilience of the economy, its tendency to grow near potential unless something is pushing it one way or another. If anything, this resilience has probably increased over the past couple of decades, reflecting more- flexible labor and product markets.  Second, global growth remains strong, supporting the growth of exports.  I don’t think this growth should be undermined by the fact that some unknown quantity of losses in the U.S. mortgage market is being absorbed by investors overseas, and the recent declines in the dollar will reinforce the effects of good foreign demand for U.S. goods and services.  Third, the most likely factor to throw the economy off its potential is the financial markets.  My most likely forecast assumed that the credit markets would begin to settle down over coming weeks with some, but limited, net tightening of conditions.  I’ll return to the subject in a bit, but my outlook in this regard does rest fundamentally on the very strong financial condition of the nonfinancial business sector and commercial banks and my expectation that most households accounting for the vast bulk of consumer spending will not find credit availability newly constrained.  Finally, a resumption of growth in consumption should be supported by moderate growth in jobs and household income as the rebound in productivity is limited by the slower path for trend productivity and as income shares shift a little toward labor.  I also assumed that households would not face a repeat of the rise in gasoline prices that has taken something out of recent consumption demand. Then moderate growth in consumption along with good export markets should, in turn, support business investment spending.  I expect this path for output to be associated with core inflation remaining in the neighborhood of 2 percent.  If energy prices follow the path in futures markets, total inflation would come down to 2 percent as well. Basically I don’t see anything in my central tendency forecast for the economy that would push inflation very much one way or another.  The economy produces around its long-run potential. My NAIRU was 4¾ percent.  Inflation expectations as best we can judge are anchored at something like 2 percent PCE inflation.  I’m encouraged that the most recent data on prices have tended to confirm that core inflation remains fairly low.  Most measures of compensation also do not show a marked acceleration that might be associated with producing appreciably beyond the economy’s sustainable level of production.  Risks around my inflation forecast remain to the upside, provided that output follows my most likely path.  Utilization is tight.  The recent run-up in energy prices could still feed through to expectations.  The damped increase in productivity growth implies greater pressure on business costs and margins.  Historically, nominal wages have tended to respond more sluggishly to changes in trend productivity than do prices, and this could be especially the circumstance when workers have seen real incomes held down by higher energy prices and business profit margins have been high. At the same time, like many around this table, I think that the downside risks around the forecast of moderate growth and production going forward have increased.  For some time I thought that the risk of a shortfall from our central tendency outweighed the risk of an overshoot, mainly centered on housing and consumption.  But the financial developments of the last intermeeting period have appreciably increased those risks.  As many have remarked, and Bill said so nicely, problems have spread from the subprime sector to a good part of the mortgage market more generally, including a severe restriction on securitization of nonconforming mortgages.  Some business credit has been affected.  Spread are widening across a broad array of instruments and ratings.  This has occurred in an atmosphere of greatly increased volatility and uncertainty, partly related to the questions about the pricing of complex structured credits that weren’t well understood and compounded by a loss of confidence in the rating agencies.  The uncertainty is also a reflection of the perception that activity and prices in the housing market have not yet shown any signs of beginning to stabilize.  I agree that we need to keep our focus on the effects of these developments and the financial markets on the economy, not on the distribution of wealth in the financial sector. The relationship of financial markets to real activity is multifaceted, not easily modeled with interest rates and stock prices, especially when markets are reconsidering risk.  Tightening nonprice terms of lending, the reduced availability of credit, and simply the pervasive sense of uncertainty about the price of assets and cash flows can also affect spending.  In such an environment, it wouldn’t be surprising if businesses and households postponed capital investments. I agree that this reassessment is a fundamentally healthy but somewhat messy correction to more-sustainable term and risk premiums.  The most likely outcome is that it will be limited in duration and effect, and that’s what I assume for my forecast.  Well-capitalized banks and opportunistic investors will come in and fill the gap, restoring credit flows to nonfinancial businesses and to the vast majority of households that can service their debts.  In the end, credit conditions will be tighter than they were a little while ago, for the most part justifiably so, and the effect on output will probably not be very large.  To be sure, the latest episode comes on top of a rise in term premiums over the May to June intermeeting period.  As a consequence, financial conditions have tightened noticeably in the past few months, even abstracting from market disruptions of the last week. The federal funds rate has been as high as it has been in part to offset the accommodative effects of low volatility and tight term and credit premiums.  I think that, even in the relatively benign adjustment scenario, we’ll need to look at whether that rate is still sufficiently supportive of economic activity.  But in the circumstances—that is, the benign adjustment—that reassessment can await further information about aggregate demand and further assurance that inflation will remain low.  I assumed an easing of policy in 2008 and 2009 in my projections to take account of this.  But we can’t know how the market situation will evolve.  I also believe that there’s a non-negligible chance of a prolonged and very messy adjustment period that would feed back substantially on confidence, wealth, and spending.  With the rating agencies discredited and markets vulnerable to adverse news on the economy, the period of unusual uncertainty could be prolonged.  The greatest risk is in the household sector, where uncertainty about valuations of mortgages could continue to feed back on credit availability, housing demand, and prices in a self-reinforcing cycle.  Moreover, as lenders and borrowers revise assumptions about house prices even further, credit from home equity lines of credit and mortgage refinancings will become even less available and more expensive, putting to the test the hypothesis that I have been working under—that the feedback from housing on consumption can be approximated by a wealth effect, not something more serious working through housing equity withdrawal.  As I noted, I don’t think this is the most likely outcome, but this tail of distribution is a lot fatter than it was only a month or so ago.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"366";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  I was looking back at my notes of the past few meetings and noted that the position we are in is a bit like that in the May meeting, at least the way in which people are characterizing things—that economic fundamentals still suggest moderate growth for the intermediate term but that uncertainty has gone up dramatically.  Then, in the June meeting, we said that uncertainty went down, and now we’re saying that uncertainty has gone up again.  So we seem to have a little volatility just like the markets do, but obviously, we are responding to what the markets are doing.  Clearly, there are key downside risks.  The risk that I’ve mentioned many times before that concerns me and that we now have more data on is productivity and potential growth.  With the revisions since ’03, the compounded growth rate of productivity is down to 1.4 percent from 1.8 percent.  The revision is fairly significant over this period.  I am not ready to go quite as far as the Greenbook has gone in marking down potential, but I do think that it is a real possibility, and it is very closely linked to my concerns about investment, which obviously the financial market volatility has affected. Orders and shipments of durable goods have been a bit choppy, and we haven’t seen the kind of rise that we would expect, given the balance sheets and given all the other sorts of strength that we would otherwise see in the economy.  Nonresidential investment has been strong, and there is still some strength in mining and drilling, but I have a lot of concerns outside that area.  As a number of people have mentioned, there is little change in the actual cost of capital, even though spreads have risen, because the Treasuries have gone down.  But with more uncertainty and more volatility, as Governor Warsh and others have mentioned, undoubtedly that is going to weigh heavily in the board room.  It is going to weigh heavily on capital expenditure plans.  So all other things being equal, businesses are likely to be a bit more cautious going forward.  But that caution with respect to investment and the slowing of the investment recovery make it harder to be optimistic about a rebound in productivity growth.  So that’s something that I watch very closely because I think it is a very, very important effect. On the consumption-saving balance, certainly we still have very robust labor markets— average growth of 120,000 private-sector jobs per month this year, which is a step down from last year but still a robust level.  We have a transition from a sort of cushion of the strong equity market offsetting the negative wealth effect in the housing market.  Now, if they become more correlated—and, in particular, more correlated and both go down—that obviously would raise some concerns about slowing consumption growth and increasing saving.  So I think that is something to be very mindful of. With respect to housing and financial markets, in the senior loan officer survey with respect to mortgages, when you drill down into it, both in April and in July more than 50 percent of the senior loan officers reported that they are tightening credit standards for subprime, and about 15 percent are for prime.  That is fairly significant.  The depository institutions are pulling back, and we have certainly heard reports that some of the large institutions are no longer offering 2/28s or 3/27s.  There has also been a tightening outside the depository institutions.  The reason for part of the tightening is that some of the mortgage providers are simply no longer there.  We have had dozens of smaller providers of credit go out of business, and the ones that are still there are obviously changing their underwriting standards.  As President Rosengren mentioned, we are seeing some questions about the originate-to-distribute model.  We are also seeing volatility on the financial market side.  But part of that volatility, as a number of people have expressed, is about concerns about what is going into those securities in the originate-to- distribute model.  That may raise some questions in the long run about how much we’re going to see this market come back.  I share Governor Warsh’s concerns, not only from the point of view of the financial markets but also regarding the structure of mortgage markets—that we may be seeing a little less of that kind of structure than we have seen in the past.  So that, combined with the tightening of standards more broadly, may make financing more difficult to get.  This, of course, is occurring in many parts of the country—not all parts but many parts—where housing inventories are very high and in some cases are still rising.  Obviously, that puts a lot more pressure on the housing market, and I think the drag from the housing market, as many of you said, is likely to continue. Fortunately, the financial market volatility is coming at a time of relative strength in corporate balance sheets.  Debt-to-asset ratios have been declining, and liquid assets as a percentage of total assets have been high.  That provides much more of a cushion, much more insurance.  As President Poole mentioned, the banking system is in a dramatically different state from when we had challenges before in the housing market or major challenges in financial markets.  The major banks have very high, relative to historical trends, capital-to-asset ratios in excess of the required minimums.  They have been very, very profitable.  If you look at the largest banks—and I was just looking at some that were most involved in the leveraged-loan market—they each have tier 1 capital on the order of $80 billion to $90 billion.  The earnings for each over the last year are $25 billion to $35 billion.  There is also a lot of discussion of the amount of highly leveraged loans in the pipeline—on the order of $300 billion.  But unless they have to take losses on that $300 billion, which is not going to happen, they have very thick capital cushions and very high earnings.  So at least for the foreseeable future, this will just be more a challenge to their earnings than a challenge to capital. That is extremely important because the banking system can provide a critical automatic stabilizing mechanism, as it did in 1998, when there are liquidity challenges.  In 1998 we had the Asian crisis that spread to Latin America, then the Russian crisis, and LTCM.  There were some parallels to what we are seeing now:  Risk spreads were rising very dramatically after a period of near-record low levels, and we saw the yields on Treasuries go down quite a bit because that’s where people were going.  But what was happening in the system was that people were pulling money out of various funds and instruments and putting it into the banking system.  So the banks do act as liquidity providers and liquidity insurers, and I think we’re starting to see a bit of that now with people pulling out of some of these instruments and so more is flowing into the banks. It’s a little early to tell.  We haven’t gotten enough data on that.  But anecdotal reports are consistent with exactly what happened in 1998.  As people need an alternative to commercial paper or other short-term sources of credit, it can be very helpful that the banking system will have more liquid resources to do that, and obviously it’s a strong capital environment.  Also, as Governor Warsh mentioned, there are more large private pools of capital to step in to bid for the LTCMs, if such things happen.  When we look back to LTCM, only one offer was on the table— from Warren Buffett—and there were a lot of questions about how serious that offer would be. Now a number of players have the wherewithal to be the equivalent of that in this market, which has the potential to be quite helpful.  There are obviously more potential downside risks, but a lot of stability exists in the banking system to deal with some of these risks and, given the strength of the balance sheets, should be helpful in the short or the intermediate run. With respect to inflation, as many people have mentioned, a number of risks are still skewed to the upside, with robust global growth, potential pass-through, some previous high energy prices, and a lower dollar.  So I still think that there is much more of a potential upside skew to inflation than a downside skew.  Basically, I would start taking my first steps, but just very first steps, a little more toward a balance of risk because of the greater downside to growth. Although there are still upside risks to inflation, as Vice Chairman Geithner mentioned, overall we might want to think of moving a little more toward a greater balance of risk but still with a predominant concern for inflation."
"367";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the Fifth District we continue to see moderate economic growth, though it has been uneven across sectors in recent weeks. Manufacturing activity rebounded somewhat in June and July after several months of weakness, with our indexes showing increases in new orders and shipments.  Activity at District services firms advanced at a steady pace, with solid revenue growth and a broader pickup in hiring.  The retail sector, however, has lost much of the momentum reported last month, as softness in big-ticket categories continues to constrain revenue growth.  On the employment front, District labor markets are increasingly taut, given steady hiring activity and slower labor force growth.  In addition, in contrast to the Eighth Federal Reserve District, contacts continue to report rising wage pressures and difficulty finding qualified workers.  Housing markets remain weak across much of the District. However, commercial real estate activity remains healthy, with steady demand reported for office and industrial space.  Some contacts, however, have expressed concern about slower activity in the retail segment of that market.  Turning to prices, our July surveys indicate increased inflation pressures.  The average current rate of increase of manufacturers’ prices has moved up for both raw materials and finished goods over the past few months, reversing the decline seen earlier this year. Price pressures on the services side have picked up as well, though expectations for future prices eased somewhat in the July report. At the national level, we continued to receive fairly good news on inflation.  After annualized rates of monthly core PCE inflation above 2 percent at the beginning of the year, we’ve now had four months of readings below 2.  But there are still abundant reasons for caution, as President Moskow, for example, noted.  I’ll mention the Greenbook, which cites transitory factors—apparel and owners’ equivalent rent, for instance—that have contributed to the recent moderation.  The passing of these damping forces could well push core inflation back up in the near term.  So although I think we have reason to take some comfort from recent inflation numbers, and I do, I want to wait to see more evidence, especially as growth moves back toward trend. I still think the prospects for a return to trend growth are reasonably good, and my assessment of trend is still a bit higher than the Greenbook’s, in part because I’ve not revised my estimate of productivity growth much in response to the GDP revisions.  Obviously, there are downside risks to be concerned about, and financial market activity since the last meeting obviously raises some concerns.  As far as we can tell at this point, the heightened turbulence of the past month is all pretty closely related to subprime and nontraditional mortgages and the leveraged financing of private equity buyouts in the corporate sector.  These two market segments are relatively new, and they represent the latest manifestation of the broad, ongoing wave of financial innovation that we’ve been seeing over the past few decades.  Because these two markets are so young, one would expect participants’ risk assessments to be more uncertain and thus be more sensitive to what is learned from market events and incoming news.  That said, developments in the past month have certainly been quite dramatic, and it looks less like rapid learning than it does rapid unlearning of what was previously viewed as known—although that, too, is of course a form of learning. The implication of these revised risk assessments for the economic outlook and for policy depend on whether they affect business investment or household spending on consumption or new housing.  At this point the answer to that question is not yet clear, but it’s worth noting that, by many measures, corporate credit quality seems to remain pretty good by historical standards, and the buyout movement, as President Poole just noted, seems to have been more about restructuring liabilities and governance arrangements and less about funding capital spending.  So it’s not obvious why there should be dramatic effects on business investment.  What about consumption?  PCE was fairly soft last quarter, and this softness could be a harbinger of more-sustained weakness.  The second-quarter softness may well be a one-time phenomenon, however, reflecting both the sharp rise in gasoline prices in the first five months of the year and some payback from the strong spending growth in Q4 and Q1.  Moreover, the outlook for household income looks pretty good, with labor market conditions fairly firm and consumption gains showing no sign of slowing down. In addition, household net worth is coming off a relatively high base.  Neither of these fundamentals seems likely to be seriously threatened by the repricing that’s in train. Housing, on the other hand, continues to be the predominant area of concern regarding real spending, and financial market developments have only heightened that concern.  The Greenbook paints a fairly pessimistic picture.  The decline in residential investment accelerates over the remainder of year and continues into next, and the inclusion of three “greater housing correction” alternative scenarios suggests that the staff is especially concerned, justifiably so in my view, with the downside risk to their outlook.  But even though the housing market has definitely deteriorated, the outlook for housing is quite uncertain in my mind, and I continue to think that a more moderate decline is also possible and that housing could be somewhat less of a drag on growth than the Greenbook forecasts.  At this point, however, the reassessment under way in secondary markets regarding housing-related credits still has a way to go, and until that process plays out, it’s going to be hard to gauge the resulting magnitude of repricing at the retail level.  About all I conclude at this point is that the outlook for housing is still awfully uncertain right now.  Thank you."
"368";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My basic view of appropriate policy is little changed from the previous meeting.  None of the intermeeting developments yet compel me to change my view that our focus should remain on reducing inflation and inflation expectations.  The outlook for GDP growth remains acceptable, especially in view of the recent downward revisions in the data and the associated lowering of estimates of growth potential.  Our baseline outlook is consistent with that of recent months, but the new concern is obviously the financial markets that clearly are skittish about spillovers from the subprime market and about contagion in credit markets spreading beyond structured products. Evidence within the Sixth District is consistent with this basically stable and positive outlook.  Florida is seeing some notable spillovers from their problems in real estate, but some of these problems are idiosyncratic to the state—for example, the widespread inability to get wind and storm insurance.  The rest of the District has not seen serious spillover into the broader economy. Just like the Greenbook, we view the fundamentals of the economy to be stable.  Although the residential real estate market may take some time to stabilize, the problem seems generally contained.  Our model suggests slightly stronger growth than the baseline Greenbook throughout the forecast period.  Our trend growth rate has not been reduced quite as much as the Greenbook’s, and our inflation forecast is not as favorable.  At this juncture, we are not ready to give much weight to some of the more extreme alternate Greenbook scenarios.  We certainly recognize more uncertainty and volatility than at the last meeting, but we’re still expecting results essentially in line with the baseline Greenbook forecast. In the past few days, I have had substantive conversations with some well-positioned credit market observers, including managers of large investment portfolios, suggesting that the skittishness of financial markets is not likely to abate until later this fall.  They have suggested that the choppiness in financial markets will be the rule in the near term and, very important, that the threshold for what constitutes a shock is now much lower than usual.  I believe that the correct policy posture is to let the markets work through the changes in risk appetite and pricing that are under way, but the market observations of one of my more strident conversational counterparts— and that is not Jim Cramer [laughter]—are worth sharing.  This party sees problems in the subprime structured debt market spreading to the CLO leveraged-loan market and, in a knock-on effect, to repo and commercial paper markets as well as to investment-grade corporate credit.  This party points to nonprice rationing, commercial paper rollover risk, and general CDO contagion caused by the damaged credibility of rating agencies and contraction of collateral values.  This party argues that treating the widening of credit spreads as normalization ignores substantial subsurface potential dislocations as evidenced by the collapse of American Home Mortgage Corporation.  All that said, another counterpart noted a large pool of money now on the sidelines that is ready to provide financing for reasonable deals if prices fall low enough.  Importantly, a large portion of this money comes from reliable long-term sources of investment, pension funds and insurance companies. Notwithstanding some descriptive rhetoric, this is not the credit crunch of the late 1980s, when the traditional financial intermediaries were strained for capital.  The traditional investors are still out there with substantial liquidity, and they are just temporarily on the sidelines for understandable reasons and, barring further shocks, should return to the markets in force later this fall.  The dislocations in the financial markets call for a posture of vigilant monitoring of developments but nothing more for now. Regarding the balance of risks, it is early to materially adjust the weighting of GDP downside versus inflation upside risks.  But I have heightened concern, as many of you do, about the continuing housing sector weakness combined with some potential of credit market turbulence in time affecting business investment and consumer confidence and thereby the real economy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   I want to make a comment following the remarks of Governor Warsh and Governor Kroszner related to the calendar of potential market stabilization and the leveraged-loan market.  Both of you cited a backlog of $300 billion or something maybe slightly less than that.  In one conversation I had, a market observer cited $470 billion and argued that it would take well beyond our September meeting, into October and November, before the market would clear in that particular part of the market.  So to connect this comment to Governor Geithner’s comment about maintaining some flexibility as we go into the fall and observe the markets, we have different estimates out there of how much backlog there is, and therefore we are likely to be still facing a great deal of uncertainty at our September meeting."
"369";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Charlie, could I ask you about the issue of the fan charts?  As I understood the proposal, the fan charts would be in there, but we would not be producing our individual fan charts.,   So I think you are absolutely right.  I strongly agree with you that it is important to have something that is visually dynamic to get across uncertainty for many, many reasons, particularly to get people to understand that, even when we don’t get it exactly right, we may still actually be doing a very good job and then, of course, to evaluate us in a more reasonable way.,   But I think it is a question of nuance.  One of the issues that I wonder about here is that for us to do a communal fan chart would be extremely difficult technically.  So the question is how we get across the issue of uncertainty in a very graphic way, and I think it can be done by producing information along the lines that the proposal mentioned.  But I think we will need to see examples.  So I would recommend that the subcommittee or whoever will be involved with the staff give us some different ways of doing it so that we can actually get some polling information on people as to whether or not this is effective.,   It is not just the media.  Think about the financial analysts who are writing about this all the time—and they get paid a lot more than we do.,   Thank you.  Well, except for the fact that we have had a benchmarking of potential GDP downward and greater weakness in housing, my forecast is basically similar to my forecast at the last FOMC meeting and is consistent with the Greenbook forecast—that we would have a return to trend growth a bit later than we had expected but by mid-2008 and 2009. In regard to the issue of inflation, let me just provide a little information on the model that I’m thinking about.  You know that I think a key driver of inflation, of course, is inflation expectations, and that there are good arguments to say that they are grounded around 2 percent. We have been seeing numbers continually coming in that are very consistent with that, which gives me more and more confidence that, in fact, inflation is gravitating strongly to this 2 percent level. But I want to talk a bit about the issue of output gaps because I think that it is important, even if you think that inflation expectations are extremely important, not to have a deus ex machina view of the inflation process, which is that inflation is caused by expected inflation and then where does that come from?  So I think that resource utilization is important.  However, the problem is that what is really important is not just current resource utilization, which is what we tend to put in our econometric specifications, but also the future expected path of resource utilization and output gaps.  Of course, one problem here is that it is hard to measure.  Also, if you are doing monetary policy right, then there is an expectation that you are going to do the right things to eliminate those output gaps.  In fact, that is exactly what is in our forecast and exactly what our policies have been doing.  So one reason I think, in the current juncture, that it is not critical to talk about output gaps a whole lot is that basically we are doing the right thing. That context gives me further reason for saying, given our forecast, that a 2 percent inflation number is where we are heading, just not now, and that the trend is solidly in place.  But we are going to stay there for the foreseeable future, unless we screw up somehow, and we are not going to do that.  [Laughter] One key point that makes me a little different from the Committee on inflation is that I do not see the upside risks as being greater than the downside risks.  I really do see the risks as being quite balanced on inflation—again around this 2 percent number.  Yes, we do have some temporarily good news, and it is going to be unraveled a bit, but it is still consistent with the 2 percent overall trend.  In terms of output gaps and future expectations, I don’t see those getting people thinking that we’re going to have too tight resource utilization. Let me turn to the issue of the financial markets because, obviously, that is the big gorilla sitting at the table.  I don’t see what is happening now as a direct spillover from the subprime market.  It is very consistent with the way that Bill was talking about this issue.  Of course, the media are making the subprime market into the whole story, but I think it is just not the right story.  The subprime market is really a very small percentage of the total credit markets.  What I think is much more important is that people are questioning and reassessing the quality of the information that exists in financial markets.  The point of the subprime market is just that we now trust the credit-rating agencies less.  Basically what I think is happening in a way is quite a good thing:  We were concerned that the markets were a little too optimistic, that there was too much opacity, and that people weren’t worried about it.  Now, in fact, they are worried about it, and I think that is fundamentally a healthy situation.  Also, the parts of the market that are having the problem are the most opaque parts, it is not clear that they are particularly important to the things we really care about in terms of our policies, which is what will happen to aggregate demand and, therefore, to both inflation and output.  So at this point, I take the view that this could all end very well and could in the long run make the situation healthier, and this view is consistent with what Governor Kohn was pointing out. But I do worry that this reassessment could actually find more—what’s the right word?— skeletons in the closet or bad things happening than were expected.  In the past, we’ve seen that, when the quality of information gets questioned and people don’t think the marketplace is providing the right information, headwinds in the economy can become quite significant.  The most recent episode that I am thinking about, of course, is the episode of Enron and its aftermath, in which a key reason that the economy was so slow to recover was that the quality of information was impaired.  Then, people realized that the markets in fact did have some slight elements of financial instability—again, not too serious because the banking system was in such good shape.  We could have a similar situation occurring now.  So the sort of bad scenario that I see is an Enron-type scenario, not something much worse than that.  But we really have to keep on top of this.  It means, I think, that there are greater downside risks to the forecast.  The survey of all of us indicates that people are now much more worried about downside risks than they are about upside risks.  I think that is absolutely right, and, in fact, it could get a lot worse.  So the way I would view the situation is that right now we should be pretty calm, but we want to monitor it very carefully and be ready for some potentially bad things to happen and just hope that they don’t.  The kind of scenario that we’re seeing in the Greenbook is one that is going to play out.  Thank you."
"370";"MR. MOSKOW.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Seventh District have changed little since our last meeting.  We continue to lag the nation largely because of difficulties in the auto industry.  Our contacts thought that the U.S. economy had softened a little since June but that international sales continue to be strong.  They also voiced continuing concerns about input cost pressures.  There is no good news to report on residential construction. Some of my contacts again pushed back their expectations on when housing markets would begin to improve and are now saying later in 2008.  We did hear some upbeat comments from our directors about nonresidential construction in the District, but manufacturers of heavy equipment indicated that they were seeing less demand for products that are used in nonresidential construction.  We also heard some less-optimistic reports about consumer spending.  A major shopping center developer and operator scaled back his expectations for the second half of this year and now thinks that spending will be softer than in the first half.  In addition, a large national specialty retailer saw a broad-based slowing in its sales over the past six weeks.  Still, no one was overly pessimistic.  In our own forecast, we assume that the weakness in consumption relative to trend during the second quarter was largely transitory, perhaps a reaction to the run-up in gasoline prices. Regarding the motor vehicle sector, the major topic of discussion is the current labor negotiations and the possibility of a strike in September.  I get the sense that the odds of a walkout are small because both the automakers and the UAW think that a strike would be very damaging.  As our director who heads the Michigan AFL-CIO noted, a strike would be mutually assured destruction.  The UAW realizes that the negotiations are occurring against the backdrop of very bad economic conditions in the traditional automaking regions.  For example, since 2000, Michigan has lost 400,000 jobs.  That’s an 8½ percent decline in employment.  A strike would be seen as just adding to these economic woes.  So from all my discussions with management and labor, my impression is that the climate for change underlying these negotiations is stronger than it has been in the past, but I am not sure how big a move the UAW leadership thinks it can get approved by its members. Of course, the major development affecting the forecast since the last round is the turmoil in credit markets that we were talking about earlier.  Our director who runs a major private equity firm made a number of interesting comments regarding the difficulties that banks were having selling off loans that had been made to risky borrowers with extremely beneficial terms, such as covenant-lite and an option to accrue interest charges.  The bottom line is that he thought that after the current shakeout there would be fewer buyouts and that pricing and terms would become more reflective of risk.  Going forward, it seems likely that the market will favor so- called strategic buyers, the nonfinancial firms that are looking for acquisitions that would directly enhance the efficiency and scale of their business operations.  So while we are concerned about the negative implications of tighter credit conditions, markets may now do a better job in pricing the tradeoff between risk and return, which is a positive development. So how might these financial developments affect the real economy?  If sustained, the fallout of credit market jitters on the stock market and other assets would weigh on spending through the standard wealth-effect channels.  With regard to the credit markets themselves, the key question is how many of the deals that are now being canceled or scaled back would have resulted in an expansion of business activity as opposed to simply transferring ownership.  Given the modest changes in interest rates on higher-rated debt, continued growth in C&I lending, and ample internal funds of nonfinancial firms, the cost of capital for most investment projects probably has not risen substantially.  So the first-order effects on spending will likely be limited. Of course, this could change quickly in the current volatile markets, and we will need to monitor these developments carefully, or should I say you will need to monitor these developments carefully.  [Laughter]  However, right now, putting all these factors together, we view the developments in credit markets as a risk to the near-term forecast but not a reason to lower the outlook for growth very much.  That said, we, like the Greenbook, have marked down our assumptions concerning potential.  We now see potential as a bit above 2½ percent.  However, relative to potential, our forecast for real activity is not much different from last round.  We see growth averaging close to potential in the second half of ’07, which is stronger than the Greenbook, but running a touch below potential in ’08 and ’09, which is similar to the Greenbook. Our inflation forecast also has not changed much since June.  We still see core PCE prices increasing a shade below 2 percent by 2009.  But I must say I remain concerned about the inflation forecast.  The standard list of upside risks—the lack of resource slack, cost pass- throughs, inflation expectations—these could break the wrong way and require a policy response.  So, if potential output growth is, in fact, significantly lower than our earlier assessment, then you could face some challenges in calibrating policy as the economy and economic agents adjust to the lower trend in productivity growth."
"371";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, the news in the Third District has been generally positive.  Economic activity continues to expand in the tri-state area but at a less rapid pace than at our previous meeting.  Our Business Outlook Survey indicates that the District’s manufacturing output continued to expand in July, although at a somewhat slower pace than in June.  The June measure, you may recall, was more than 18 in our Business Outlook Survey, the highest level that it had been since April 2005.  In July the index dropped to a little over 9, although it was still significantly positive.  Shipments of new orders increased in July, and the outlook for manufacturers’ own capital spending plans remains positive and is at a level typical of an expansion.  Firms in our survey generally see improvements in their businesses coming in the second half of the year.  Residential construction, however, continues to be very weak in the region, but we have not seen, at least according to OFHEO indexes, any absolute price declines in our area. This is confirmed by our business contacts, who report that they have not seen steep or broad-based declines in house prices, except for properties along the Jersey shore, where the boom was most prevalent.  At our last meeting I characterized the nonresidential investment market as firm, and that characterization continues today.  Office vacancy rates in the Philadelphia region remain very low and declining, and rents in office and warehouse spaces remain at a record high.  Although reports on retail sales in our region have been mixed, sales appear to have improved somewhat in late June and early July, especially at higher-end retail establishments. Bank lending has continued to advance but at a more moderate pace than at the time of our last meeting.  Our banking and other business contacts indicate that banks have money to lend to customers with good credit ratings, and so I don’t get the sense that area businesses are facing a credit crunch of the normal type.  Banks are comfortable with their lending standards and do not expect to make any big changes along this dimension in the foreseeable future.  For the most part our banks were not in the subprime business and obviously don’t intend to start now, [laughter] and thus they have not seen an appreciable deterioration in their balance sheets or in those of the businesses to which they lend—their customers.  Clearly, there is nervousness, but as yet there seem to be few consequences for the real economy. June employment growth in the region was below trend, but the region’s unemployment rate remains relatively low.  Our staff expects employment to continue to grow at a moderate pace going forward and expects the region’s unemployment rate perhaps to rise modestly by the second quarter of next year.  Yet businesses continue to report tight labor markets.  One very large builder, who is headquartered in our area and who builds mostly high-end homes, has actually reported that he cannot finish a number of homes that he has under contract and that buyers are waiting to move into.  He cannot find labor.  Because of the crackdown on illegal immigrants, who do a lot of the landscaping, a lot of roofing work, and all the labor that goes into finishing these homes, he cannot hire these workers, and so he actually has to put off closing deals because he cannot find workers to complete the homes. On the inflation front in the District, employment costs in the Northeast are increasing at about the same pace as in the nation.  Area manufacturers continue to report higher production costs, but there is relatively little evidence of pass-through of those higher costs to customers as they see it.  Consumer prices are growing more slowly in the region than in the nation.  So in summary, the Third District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  While there is nervousness caused by the recent volatility in the financial markets, businesses do not yet see that affecting their current growth or prospects for future growth.  Business contacts as well as the Philadelphia staff expect this moderate pace of expansion to be continued in the coming months. At the national level, the news has been mixed.  On the positive side, employment and income growth remain solid.  Manufacturing output continues to improve, and core inflation and inflation expectations remain contained, although both remain higher than I would like to see in the long run.  On the negative side, news on business fixed investment and housing has been disappointing.  After encouraging signs of stabilization early in the year, the sales of both new and existing homes have continued to decline.  Sales of homes declined 6.6 percent in June and almost 8 percent in the second quarter.  At the time of our last meeting, I expressed the view that I was getting hopeful that economy was on track to return to near-trend growth later this year.  Setting aside the issue that our perception of long-term trend growth in real GDP may need reassessment in light of the benchmark revisions, as we’ve been discussing—and I’ll return to this point in a moment—the recent data on housing are suggestive of a weaker third quarter and perhaps fourth quarter as well.  Though I think the underlying steady-state demand for housing is lower than the pace of housing demand before we saw the downturn begin, which implies that much of the adjustment in housing supply is part of a healthy adjustment to a new equilibrium, the stock of unsold homes continues to cause a drag on residential investment.  I also think that there is some risk of temporary weakness in business fixed investment going forward simply because of increased uncertainty.  So the return to trend growth, which I think will happen within the forecast period, may be delayed by a few quarters and may not get under way solidly until late in the first half of next year.  You know the old saying:  “If you can’t forecast well, forecast often.”  [Laughter] The biggest economic news headlines since our last meeting have focused on the volatility of the financial markets and the repricing of risk.  I am inclined to put minimal weight on the current financial conditions for a slowdown in the pace of economic activity going forward.  Although risk spreads have widened in the past three weeks or so, the cost of capital for high quality borrowers has hardly changed and remains relatively low by historical standards.  This suggests to me that what we are seeing in the marketplace—at least right now but which could change, as we’ve all noted—is a change in the relative price of various measures of types of risk.  The cost of capital for some borrowers is increased, but demand for business investments that originate from large corporations with good credit ratings has not changed and is not likely to be adversely affected very much in the repricing of risk, if that’s what this represents.  This news was reinforced to me by my conversations with area bankers, as I mentioned earlier, who say that they have plenty of money to lend to good credit risks.  There is no evidence of a general credit crunch from their point of view. My general view regarding the limited nature of the credit repricing is reinforced by the fact that default rates on auto loans, credit cards, and other types of consumer debt instruments have not changed much, suggesting that the spillover effects, at least to date, have not been very measurable. Thus, I think that the decline in the subprime market is primarily a result of lax underwriting.  Those lenders are now paying the price, but we must be very careful not to act or appear to act in a way that supports bad bets or lax underwriting standards without more widespread evidence of systemic problems affecting the real economy. Let me now turn to what I think is a more fundamental factor for gauging the strength of the economy going forward and, therefore, the appropriate stance for monetary policy.  In the most recent Greenbook, the Board staff revised down the rate of growth of structural productivity more or less in line with the reduction in real GDP growth, as we have been discussing.  It is certainly reasonable to think that this new information about the pace of real GDP growth during the past three years contains information about the rate of growth of structural productivity going forward. But that is not an infallible signal.  In my thinking about how monetary policy needs to be set, distinguishing temporary decreases in the rate of growth of productivity from permanent decreases is a critical piece of the puzzle.  A transitory decrease would not affect the steady-state equilibrium real rate to my mind.  But a permanent decrease would imply a lower steady-state equilibrium real rate and, thus, a lower natural rate for the federal funds rate.  If the equilibrium real rate is lower, holding the fed funds rate constant, of course, would imply an implicit tightening of monetary policy. I am still grappling with the implications of these benchmark revisions for future productivity growth.  At this point in my forecast, I’m assuming that the revisions imply a rebenchmarking of the growth rate of structural productivity, but that rebenchmarking or that lowering of the trend rate of growth of real GDP is not enough so that core inflation can decelerate toward price stability in the next two or three years or so under a constant fed funds rate.  But the reduction in the growth rate of structural productivity does feed through to a somewhat looser required path of the fed funds rate through 2008 to 2009.  In my forecast, appropriate policy has the fed funds rate rising to 5½ percent in the first quarter of ’08, holding steady there for two or three quarters, and then gradually drifting down toward a more neutral rate consistent with lower inflation expectations and lower trend output growth.  With this path of the fed funds rate, I expect the economy to return to near potential real GDP growth in the first or the second quarter of 2008.  I expect the housing correction to continue through the first half of 2008, but the drag lessens over the year.  I expect the core inflation rate to be somewhat higher in the second half of the year than in the first half, but I expect the economy by 2009 to grow near its potential growth rate, which I now assume to be 2.8 percent, about 0.2 percent lower than I had last time, with the unemployment rate close to its natural rate of 5 percent and core inflation at about 1.5 percent. I have two other brief comments I’d like to make about our forecasting exercise and some information I think is relevant.  We continue to focus on the PCE price index, and I have some objections to that.  I continue to believe that the CPI is a better measure, if for no other reasons than that it is more familiar to the public and that it is not revised.  We were lucky this time in the GDP revisions that the PCE price index was not revised very much, and I think we run the risk that focusing too heavily on a measure that does get revised can cause us some difficulty.  I also have some concern about the empirical ability of core PCE to actually be a very good predictor of headline PCE inflation at the end of the day.  So I am still struggling with our choice of the index there.  The other item that I would like to emphasize—and it was driven home to me in a meeting with some reporters in the not-too-distant past—is that I do believe that moving toward measures of uncertainty that include some fan charts would be useful.  I was hesitant at first about that in part because getting appropriate measures of uncertainty that are internally consistent across all our forecasts and all our models would be very difficult.  Yet some, what I would view as very sophisticated, journalists continue to confuse the issue of the range of our forecasts and our central tendencies with the issue of uncertainty or certainty.  They do not understand that our central tendency is an agreement about what our point forecast is but that it may reveal very little or nothing about the degree of uncertainty in our forecasts.  So I think it is very important that we quantify that in some way to be clearer and to eliminate some of that confusion.  I’ll stop there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,    Right.,   Well, I am encouraged that that is going to be the case.,   That is fine.  This point was driven home to me by somebody who I thought was fairly sophisticated.  He saw the central tendency narrow and thought that therefore we were more certain about what our forecasts were.,   No, they are not.,   They could be negatively correlated actually.  Just because our point forecasts converge does not mean that our uncertainty about that forecast is decreased.,   It just means that there is more agreement."
"372";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the beginning of the break, two of our leaders made a special point of indicating that I was first up after the break.  I guess that was an invitation to be fast and quick.  [Laughter]  I’ll try. My overall impression from my business contacts is that things are more of the same rather than anything very much different.  I would note that the financial market upset is too recent to have affected the plans of companies operating in the real economy.  Obviously financial firms are scrambling.  There seems to be something of a disconnect between my trucking industry contacts and what I see in the industrial production numbers.  The industrial production numbers suggest that goods production is rising; I don’t know how they’re moving, but they don’t seem to be moving by truck.  One big over-the-road trucker says that loads are down 8 percent year over year.  The company has already cut trucking capacity 10 percent.  He expects another cut of 4 percent by the end of this year.  He’s trimming capital spending next year for trucks.  Obviously they see the business as being pretty slack.  Incidentally, nobody is talking about any particular labor market pressures.  Another big company probably best known for the color of its brown trucks [laughter] says that the industry overall is flat year over year.  It believes that the outlook is somewhat more optimistic than recent experience.  The international business is booming.  The Asia-Pacific region is shipping an awful lot of goods to both the United States and Europe.  My contact noted something that I thought was sort of interesting.  He said that there is some diversion from air freight to water transport—I guess because of the enormous cost difference, but it suggests that there may be a little easier inventory situation or something that is making that diversion make sense.  This company is very much in a cost-cutting mode because they have a big infrastructure, demand is relatively slack, and they have a lot of cost built in; and so the only thing they can do when they can’t build volume in the short run is to cut costs.  That company’s major competitor is much more optimistic and has capital spending plans for fiscal ’08, which ends in May of next year, up 20 percent from this year and sees a pretty strong business situation at least going forward. A contact in the restaurant industry says that restaurant prices are rising everywhere and volumes are falling, but overall business conditions are about the same.  The restaurant industry has been seeing that.  A contact with a major software firm is pretty optimistic.  PC sales are running at or above expectation.  My contact pointed out particularly that the quality of receivables has actually improved.  They’re not seeing any problem with collecting on the software that they sell, and 94 percent of the customers are current on making payments.  Even that is something of an underestimate because a lot of purchasers initiate the payment at the end of a thirty-day due period, and so the payment doesn’t come for another couple of days, despite our brilliant electronic clearing of payments. A comment about the housing industry:  Obviously the subprime issue is going to have a relatively permanent effect.  It is just changing the characteristic of this industry.  Underwriting was too lax, and that is changing.  I think it is somewhat surprising that the builders have not scaled back more quickly—that they continue to sit on such a large inventory.  Part of the reason is that, once a builder has started a development and has put all the infrastructure in place—the roads, the sewers, the water, and all of that—the only way to get anything out of that investment is to complete the subdivision.  In addition, a subdivision that stops is a bad signal for prospective buyers because they don’t want to move into something that is sitting there mostly idle.  So I think the builders have an intense interest in trying to complete these projects.  But what that means, of course, is that, as they complete those projects, they are not initiating a lot because they’re taking, as Richard pointed out, some pretty big price concessions in many cases, and so they are probably not going to be initiating as many projects in the future. My own bet is that the financial market upset is not going to change fundamentally what’s going on in the real economy.  First of all, bank capital is not impaired.  So unlike in some past cases, when losses on real estate impaired bank capital and thus affected the lending in areas that had nothing to do with real estate, I don’t think that’s the case this time.  Second, the fact that some LBO deals fall through isn’t going to change what those companies are producing.  The fact that the ownership hasn’t changed doesn’t change the company’s profit-maximizing level of production in the short run.  Obviously, that could change, but it seems to me that the best information that we now have is that this financial market upset is going to settle out and not have major repercussions on the real economy, putting the housing part aside.  Thank you."
"373";"MR. ROSENGREN.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  The Boston staff forecast is broadly consistent with the Greenbook forecast, with export-led growth being significantly offset by weakness in residential investment, resulting in a gradual increase in the unemployment rate and core PCE inflation settling around 2 percent.  The Boston staff forecast is somewhat more optimistic on residential investment but also has somewhat higher potential than the Greenbook forecast.  My own view is that residential investment is likely to be as weak as in the Greenbook forecast but that potential may be closer to Boston’s estimate.  Taken together, weak residential investment and somewhat stronger productivity, along with the possibility that construction employment will be more depressed going forward, may result in more of an upward drift in unemployment, helping to reduce some of the concerns with labor market pressures on inflation.  However, given the similarities in the forecasts, well within standard errors, at this time it is probably more important to highlight the risks to the forecast.  It is notable that the rather benign outlook of the forecasters is in marked contrast to the angst I hear when talking to asset and hedge fund managers in Boston.  The angst is new and reflects heightened concerns with the financial ramifications stemming from subprime mortgages. Recent developments in residential markets are of potential concern.  They have been raised by many around the table.  Over the past several years, large homebuilders have been able to increase their market share.  Given the use of subcontractors and with little obvious economies of scale, the primary advantage of large homebuilders would seem to be access to external finance, which allows them to purchase large tracts of land.  When housing and land prices were rising, particularly in fast growing areas of the country, this access provided a significant advantage over the small builders that could not tie up significant resources in land.  However, what provided a competitive advantage in the first half of this decade now places a significant strain on large homebuilders.  A large investment in land whose price is falling is aggravating the problem these builders have with unsold inventory and depressed prices for new homes.  Not surprisingly, the largest homebuilders, which account for nearly a quarter of homes sold, have equity prices trading lower than at any time in the past year, and recent earnings announcements have highlighted significant write-downs in land values.  The low equity prices of homebuilders seem broadly consistent with residential investment remaining quite weak well into 2008. Financial market disruptions are likely to be a further impediment to the housing market and potentially provide a channel for problems to extend beyond residential investment.  A number of financial instruments, such as the 2/28 and 3/27 mortgages that were widely used last year, are no longer readily available.  Furthermore, the originate-to-distribute model has been disrupted by the heightened uncertainty surrounding CDOs and CLOs that we heard about earlier this morning. There seem to be two significant developments.  First, the liquidity of these instruments has declined, making valuation assessment difficult.  As lenders have made margin calls, forced liquidation of collateral in illiquid markets has further depressed the market.  While of concern, I would hope that this is only a short-run effect.  The second development of concern is that many investors have been relying on rating agencies to evaluate credit risk but the underlying credit risk is relatively opaque and the correlations between tranches may not have been fully appreciated.  If investors have lost confidence in the rating agencies to accurately assess credit risk for structured products, the market could be impeded until confidence is restored.  Since similar structures are used for financial instruments besides mortgages, getting secondary market financing for a broader range of financing needs could be difficult, and external financing for some borrowers could be affected.  This has been reflected in the widening spreads for riskier corporate bonds, where the spreads have widened from unusually low levels and are still relatively narrow compared with earlier periods of significant financial disruption. While recent problems are not compelling enough for me to have a significant disagreement with the forecast presented in the Greenbook, the risks surrounding that forecast on the downside have increased.  I remain concerned that higher oil prices, a falling dollar, and tight labor markets pose upward risks to the forecast of inflation, but recent events have significantly raised my estimate of the risk of a slower economy than I would have predicted a few weeks ago."
"374";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, as best I can judge, recent readings on the economy are generally consistent with anticipation of moderate growth and some gradual diminution or at least no deterioration in inflation.  Second-quarter GDP readings, as far as I can tell, contain no big surprises.  In particular, the components of aggregate demand that were expected to bounce back after periods of sluggishness or, in some cases, correction—inventory accumulation, spending on equipment and software, and federal government outlays—all in fact did bounce back as anticipated.  The labor market report for July was positive, and anecdotes and indicators in our District are generally quite consistent with the tenor of that report.  The labor market appears to be healthy.  Job availability appears to be ample.  The labor market overall, I would say, is strong. Of course, all of that is by way of background because that information has been overshadowed in recent weeks by what I think are three or four developments of greater significance, one of which is the revision to the NIPA accounts.  The GDP and productivity data and, in particular, the downward revision to productivity may have significant implications for the longer-term performance of the economy.  I won’t dwell on that now.  Dave Wilcox covered some of that earlier.  There was also an upward revision to the personal saving rate, which possibly has implications for the outlook for consumer spending going forward, and I will come to that briefly in a moment.  Of course, the big headlines have been the turbulence in the financial markets and all the uncertainty associated with the duration of the repricing and the adjustments that are under way and their quantitative significance for the performance of the economy going forward.  This turbulence in the financial markets is likely the most significant development for the short-term performance of the economy and possibly for policy.  But at this point, it is very difficult, to put it mildly, to assess its effects for reasons I alluded to earlier— namely, that we don’t know how long this will last and what will follow in its wake.  Even if we knew the duration, would we be—at least would I be—all that confident that we could go from that to the magnitude of the effects on the economy?  So all of that suggests to me that we should have a good deal of caution at the moment.  Since we don’t, it seems to me, know enough to act decisively, we certainly don’t want to overreact or to act wrongly in these circumstances.  These developments really have taken hold forcefully in the past several weeks.  The situation has not been so dramatic for any extended period of time. Returning to the saving rate for a moment, I am quite cautious about drawing implications for consumer spending on the basis of a judgment about whether the saving rate is likely to go up or down.  An argument has been popular in some circles that, with the negative saving rate as reported until recently in the data, the implications for consumer spending were likely that spending was going to be sluggish going forward because the negative saving rate couldn’t persist.  It seems to me that the argument now, at a minimum, has to be less compelling, and so, other things being equal, we might be tempted to become more optimistic about consumer spending.  That could be swamped, of course, by the negative wealth effects coming out of the adjustments in the financial markets and the tighter financial market conditions as well.  On net, I guess I come out where I usually do on this—that it is mostly a matter of employment and incomes—and so far so good on that score. Finally, and this is the fourth development that I will mention—although I don’t think it’s as important as the other three, but I did want to comment on it—it looks as though, as part of the revisions to the NIPA accounts, the increase in unit labor costs will be revised up for the previous three years—that is, for ’04, ’05, and ’06.  I think that’s right.  Now, this is a matter of correlation and not causation, but it does appear that there is a pretty high correlation in the short run between unit labor costs and inflation.  That observation flashes a bit of a warning light on our expectations of a fundamental slowing of inflation over time.  Thank you."
"375";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many of us have discussed around this table and many of you already mentioned today, it has finally happened.  Per earlier discussions, the much-anticipated repricing of risk is upon us, and I think what we all have quickly recognized, then and now, is that the diagnosis was the easy part.  More difficult is to figure when the symptoms would manifest themselves; harder still is to understand the second- and third-order consequences; and perhaps most difficult is to determine whether any treatment is needed or whether, as the Hippocratic oath suggests, the patient will recover on its own.  Even orderly repricings have fat tails, as Governor Kohn mentioned, and what we find in the marketplace is complacency replaced very quickly by deep concern.  Certainly, this recent market turmoil looks particularly pronounced in contrast to previous periods when trees appeared to grow to the sky and markets were priced for perfection in a world that seemed to most of us to be decidedly imperfect.  Let me discuss two distinct matters—first, the state of the financial markets, building on the presentation from Bill, Tim, and others, and then the harder part, the impact on the broader economy—before trying to summarize the situation. The financial markets have really provided wind at the back of the broader economy throughout this most recent period, even until a month ago.  I think the open question, and the hardest, is whether those financial markets will prove sufficiently resilient—that is, whether the underlying shocks to the economy that might occur are exacerbated by this financial market situation or whether the worst of the outcomes are made less severe by the financial markets. Perhaps it is best to review the dynamics of different asset markets to assess their implications for credit availability during the forecast period.  The threat is that these different asset classes increasingly look correlated, particularly in times of distress.  Certainly, the events of recent weeks culminating in trading late Thursday and Friday of last week are troubling, driven by a combination of factors:  first, symbolized perhaps by one financial institution that has unwittingly called its own liquidity into some question; second, a function of a reduction in confidence in markets themselves—a pullback in liquidity—with considerably less trust in underlying valuations, underlying collateral, and the underlying structure of markets themselves; and third, an expectation, at least in the mortgage markets, that there is still another leg down and so one way bets, at least for a period, appear insufficient to bring other opportunistic capital in at this point.  The pullback was manifested in the difficulty of rolling over extendable commercial paper, as Bill and others have said, a lack of bid for anything mortgage related, a lack of trust in credit ratings, and a fear of using financial institutions as counterparties.  The next period in my judgment holds out some promise, but not a guarantee, of opportunistic capital.  Certainly, there are big fund raisings by investment banks and other private pools of capital at remarkable leverage levels, giving the potential that the pools of liquidity that are on the sidelines could quickly find their way back into the game. Let me now turn to different asset markets to try to assess when we will know how they will figure themselves out and make sure that we are able to get some judgments before it is too late.  So I will spend a moment on the bank and leveraged-loan markets, a couple of moments on the subprime market, and another moment on a third bucket of assets, which might be everything else, as we are trying to figure out whether there is real spreading.  First, in the bank and leveraged-loan market, the volume of loans, as many of you know, is somewhere between $220 billion and $320 billion of committed capital in the pipeline.  The underlying credits still appear quite strong, and I will tell you that I have a reasonably high degree of confidence that, in spite of the distress, these markets should work themselves out between now and the next FOMC meeting.  We certainly won’t see any return to the markets that people have gotten used to over the past several months and years, but I would be surprised if we didn’t see opportunistic capital coming into these markets and bidding prices.  Just to give you some idea, off that denominator of capital committed, we might see losses on the order of $30 billion or $50 billion.  I would say that’s a fairly conservative estimate.  Bank debt, which is the most secured, might have discounts of 3 to 5 percent, should bids find their way into the market in the coming days; leveraged loans and high yields, discounts of about 10 percent; and second lien mortgages, discounts of 15 to 20 percent.  Almost all of these are largely related to risk premiums, not credit quality.  Real money is still in these businesses.  Some of the hot money that was discussed earlier, some of these CLO buyers, are no doubt gone for some time.  I think the most encouraging thing is the new funds that have begun capital-raising campaigns, even over the past weekend, looking to buy the distressed securities, market-force the commercial institutions that have been having it on their books, and mark it to market.  Remarkably, many of the same commercial banks are prepared to stand behind these new leveraged investments with leverage of about 4 to 1.  So I would expect that market to increase pretty quickly.  Market functioning there is thus, in my judgment, likely to improve.  Some deals are certainly likely to blow up, relieving some of these banks of their commitments.  But in this market, because there are multiple gatekeepers and because valuing the underlying credit strikes me as not that time-intensive or taxing a process, it is likely in my judgment that, come fall, we will come to some new equilibrium. I can be far less confident, however, about the subprime mortgage market.  My base case assessment there has a much lower confidence level, both in terms of timing and in terms of outcome.  The subprime market has about $1.4 trillion in outstandings, and there is considerably less certainty about the underlying credit.  It is harder to measure and appraise the underlying pools.  Recovery rates will be still harder to find.  As a final note, which might have struck the markets last week, apparently more fraud is endemic to these pools, making valuation increasingly difficult.  As a result, I am less comfortable about suggesting what the underlying losses might be.  They might be $100 billion.  They could be considerably more.  I’m also less confident that there will be opportunistic capital coming back to these markets over the next thirty or sixty days.  With another leg down, it could take considerably longer.  As a result, I am quite a bit less confident that the market functioning will return as rapidly as we would hope.  I am more concerned that, unlike the multiple gatekeepers we find in the leveraged-loan markets, for those that relied on the single gatekeepers, the credit-rating agencies, given that their credibility has been shot, it is much harder to see that this market will unwind itself in a rather calm and comforting environment, at least over the balance of 2007. The final set of asset markets I’d speak a moment about is “everything else.”  What about everything else that is subject to structured products?  What about everything else that is subject to complex financial instruments?  Some questions arose late last week about the market integrity regarding those.  I think it is just too hard to judge how that is going to work out.  We are seeing losses showing up in some very unlikely places.  I’d like to say that what we have witnessed over the past week is transitory, but for that set of asset markets, it is probably hardest for me to come to a broader judgment. So what are the effects, then, on the broader economy?  I agree with the point that President Stern made earlier that this judgment is extremely hard to make.  I also agree with Governor Kohn’s judgment that there is a very real downside risk if some of these financial market turmoil issues persist.  If I look at some of the credit channels and at financial intermediaries and ask whether they are under stress, I see more dispersion of risk among similarly situated institutions.  Some commercial banks may well be under more distress than others.  I have no doubt that some investment banks are under more distress than others.  We see some of this dispersion in credit default swaps and some of it in equity prices, but my sense is that the underlying fundamentals of their core businesses are very different from each other and from their competitors than they’ve been at any point in this cycle.  For some of them to take losses on their own balance sheets of $3 billion, $4 billion, or $5 billion, as an investment bank, might not be hard to do when many of them have been picking up market share and using their own proprietary trading and agency businesses to steal customers and revenue from others.  But for the balance, I think it is unclear how it is going to result.  With many of the investment banks’ quarters ending in August, the markets are going to put genuine pressure on them to come clean with their losses.  I expect most, if not all, of them to do so.  So I think come mid- September we’ll have a clearer sense of what their own marked-to-market models suggest.  What about the broker-dealers?  Again, not principally their regulators but I suspect the markets are going to push them to come clean with what their losses are.  Large financial institutions I would expect, though with less confidence, to take writedowns of their portfolios of leveraged loans and writedowns to some extent of their mortgage products to try to assure the investing community of their financial positions.  I hope that the process would work out this fall, but as I mentioned, I’m less comfortable that we’re going to get that kind of transparency with the regulated commercial banks than with some others. Private pools of capital are also undergoing a real shakeout.  For those with liquidity pressures, which will tend not to be the largest hedge funds or private equity funds, we will read about their problems, and we will read about their closings, over the coming weeks and months. The good news is that the largest among them have used the period of strong liquidity over the past year to more or less have quasi-permanent capital to term out their loans and provide capital so that they could take advantage in this period.  I understand that there has been very little spike in margin calls where most of the assets rest in the hedge fund community.  So for many of us who have talked about hedge funds bringing resilience to these markets, this is really a time of testing.  I think the early news for the largest among them is quite positive. Many of you have talked about what the other transmission mechanisms are for having GDP effects.  The wealth effect is real.  We have lost about $1 trillion in market capital in the past twenty trading days, and that can’t be discounted.  Questions about board room confidence and cap-ex in the second half of this year are equally real.  My sense is that we are going to finally use that excess cash on balance sheets that many of us have long talked about.  Finally, with respect to consumer confidence, though I think the recent data suggest that it’s positive, I suspect that the next set of data we get will show a retreat from those numbers.  It is very hard to judge how real consumers are going to react here. Let me make two final comments.  Opportunistic capital is a key here to a smooth transition.  It’s key to ensuring that what happened in the financial markets doesn’t seep its way into the real economy.  Of the equity investors that were using loose credit markets to get equity returns, the most sophisticated are focusing on and looking for equity returns in the debt markets. So many investors previously investing in equity are now looking to the debt markets, where they see a risk-reward tradeoff that is better than it has been in a long time.  That gives me some confidence that opportunistic capital will come back to some of these markets.  That said, rating- sensitive buyers will no doubt pull back given that ratings are less authoritative.  So I will end where I began, which is looking at economic fundamentals.  I think Governor Kohn talked about how the capital markets, the financial markets, and the labor markets have proven to be absolutely core to the resilience of the broader economy.  To the extent that there is now an unfortunate timing between weakness in the financial markets and some potential weakness in underlying credit, we can rely less on the financial markets to come to the rescue, should that circumstance occur.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"376";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports that I am hearing from business leaders in the Fourth District lead me to conclude that the pace of economic activity hasn’t changed a great deal since our last meeting.  However, the uncertainties surrounding the business climate seem to have risen measurably.  The troubled housing sector is still weighing on the region, as it is nationally.  I now have little doubt that this theme is going to recur throughout the balance of the year and perhaps well beyond.  My view of the housing sector conforms closely to the way housing is depicted in the Greenbook baseline, but I have had many conversations in the past few weeks with anxious industry insiders, who believe that housing markets are likely to worsen substantially over the balance of the year with the possibility of significant spillovers to other sectors of the economy.  The stories they tell me sound a lot like the greater housing correction scenarios that are depicted in the Greenbook.  Indeed, casualties in the mortgage markets are rising, and I am hearing more and more that the fallout from housing is affecting deals in other sectors of the economy.  For example, I talked with a CEO who runs a large national real estate development company.  He told me that some of his projects are being held up by his investment banker’s inability to price deals and to bring them to market.  Where the deals can be priced, risk spreads have widened across a range of issuers and financial instruments.  This CEO’s comments are very much in line with the points that Bill Dudley made in his report earlier this morning. Because of these uncertainties in financial markets, some of my contacts confirm that they have been reevaluating their capital formation plans.  They are trimming their projections of some of the projects that they are going to put on the books, and that led me to trim my projection for business fixed investment accordingly.  Even with this adjustment, however, I am concerned that the pattern of business investment that I have incorporated into my GDP projections for this meeting may still be somewhat optimistic.  This is a risk to the outlook that was not on my radar screen at our last meeting. The June retail price measures gave us more evidence that the inflation trend may be coming down.  Inflation moderated in the second quarter, as measured by the median CPI and the 16-percent trimmed mean that we produce at the Cleveland Fed.  I am not yet persuaded that this progress will be sustained, but the patterns in the June data were promising.  My projection for inflation in the outyears of the forecast are actually a little more favorable than what is in the Greenbook baseline, primarily because I still expect a bit more potential GDP growth than the Greenbook envisions.  So I am feeling more comfortable about the inflation risks than I have felt for a while but less comfortable about the real-side risks.  My overall risk assessment is moving closer into balance.  Nevertheless, I still think that inflation is the predominant risk we face today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"377";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Data on inflation during the intermeeting period have continued to be encouraging, but the prospects for economic activity have become dicier.  The results for GDP in the second quarter as a whole actually took on a positive tone, with final sales mainly accounting for the healthy growth rate.  But the quarter ended on a weak note, with disappointing data for housing consumption and for orders of core capital goods.  Of course, the big developments since our last meeting were in financial markets.  I read them as pointing to weaker growth going forward and greater downside risk.  The market for mortgage- backed securities is now highly illiquid, and there are indications that credit problems are spilling beyond the subprime sector.  It thus seems likely that lending standards will tighten for a broader class of borrowers in the mortgage market. The drop in equity prices and rising rates on most risky corporate debt are further negatives for growth.  There are some offsets to these negative factors, including the decline in the dollar and, most important, the steep reduction we have seen in risk-free rates.  On balance, however, I expect these offsets to be only partial, providing a cushion against future weakness, because I interpret the decline in Treasury rates during the intermeeting period primarily as a reflection of weaker growth expectations and a correspondingly lower path for the expected future fed funds rate and not a consequence of the fall of the term premium.  The jump in oil prices since our last meeting is a further factor weighing on aggregate demand.  As a result of these considerations, I have lowered my growth forecast for the second half of this year ½ percentage point, to just over 2 percent.  This rate is moderately below my estimate of potential growth, which I now put at about 2½ percent. Going beyond this year, the outlook depends on one’s assumption concerning appropriate monetary policy.  I consider it appropriate for policy to aim at holding growth just slightly below potential to produce enough slack in labor and credit markets to help bring about a further gradual reduction in inflation toward a level consistent with price stability.  Barring a more serious and prolonged tightening of credit market conditions or a general liquidity squeeze, I would keep the fed funds rate modestly above its equilibrium level to accomplish this goal. However, I now see the fed funds rate as well above the neutral level.  So I think it likely that the fed funds rate will need to fall appreciably over the next few years.  My assessment of the neutral federal funds rate declined during the intermeeting period for two main reasons—first, because of the tightening in financial conditions associated with the reassessment of risk now taking place and, second, because of the NIPA revisions, which suggest slower structural productivity growth and, in all likelihood, correspondingly slower growth in aggregate demand.  I thus think that a larger decline in the fed funds rate will be needed over time than in the Greenbook baseline to achieve a soft landing. A key development during the intermeeting period was the downward revision of real GDP growth over the 2004-06 period.  This adjustment reinforces the work of productivity experts at the Board and elsewhere who had previously found evidence of a slowdown in underlying productivity growth.  The revision in actual productivity was big enough to lead us to lower our estimate of growth in both structural productivity and potential output, although our estimates remain above those in the Greenbook.  In addition to tighter financial conditions, lower structural productivity growth was the reason that we lowered our forecast for real GDP growth to 2¼ percent in 2008.  As a result, the unemployment rate edges up in our forecast, reaching nearly 5 percent by the end of next year.  The modest amount of slack that this entails should help bring about the desired gradual reduction of inflation in the future. Readings on core PCE prices have been quite tame for some time now, rising only 0.1 percent in each of the past four months.  Although a portion of the recent deceleration in core prices likely reflects transitory influences, the underlying trend in core inflation still appears favorable.  We anticipate that the core PCE price index will rise 2 percent this year and that core inflation will gradually ebb to around 1.8 percent over the forecast period.  This forecast is predicated on continued well-anchored inflation expectations and the eventual appearance of a small amount of labor market slack, as I just mentioned. For some time now, I’ve thought an argument could be made that the NAIRU was a bit lower than assumed in the Greenbook, and the new evidence that structural productivity growth has been lower than we thought for more than three years reinforces this view.  It means that the relatively good inflation performance over this period occurred despite the upward pressure that must have been operating because of the deceleration in structural productivity.  In any event, I also expect to see modest downward pressure on inflation in the next couple of years from the ebbing of the upward effects of special factors, including the decline in structural productivity, energy and commodity prices, and owners’ equivalent rent. In terms of risk to the outlook for growth, the housing sector obviously remains a serious concern.  We seem to be repeatedly surprised with the depth and duration of the deterioration in these markets; and the financial fallout from developments in the subprime markets, which I now perceive to be spreading beyond that sector, is a source of appreciable angst.  Of course, financial conditions have deteriorated in markets well beyond those connected with subprime instruments or even residential real estate more generally.  It appears that participants are questioning structured credit products in general, the risk assessments of the rating agencies, and the extent of due diligence by originators who package and sell loans but no longer hold a very sizable fraction of these originations on their own balance sheets.  The Greenbook has long highlighted, and we have long worried about, the possibility and potential consequences of a broader shift in risk perceptions.  With risk premiums having been so low by historical standards, it would hardly be surprising to see them rise, making financial conditions tighter for any given stance of monetary policy.  While it remains possible that financial markets will stabilize or even reverse course in the days and weeks ahead, the possibility that the financial markets are now shifting to a historically more typical pattern of risk pricing is very much on my radar screen. Should this pattern persist and possibly intensify, it will have very important implications for policy."
"378";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070807meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The balance of risks has changed since our last meeting—significantly, in my view.  Overall spending by households and businesses is weaker.  Housing, of course, is significantly worse, and the underlying pace of productivity growth and potential growth seems lower.  In addition, financial market developments have deteriorated with a very broad based increase in risk premiums, decline in some asset prices, pockets of liquidity pressures, and some disruption in mortgage markets and high-yield corporate credit markets.  These developments in financial markets, even though they represent a necessary adjustment, a generally healthy development, have the potential to cause substantial damage through the effects on asset prices, market liquidity, and credit; through the potential failure of more-consequential financial institutions; and through a general erosion of confidence among businesses and households.  If this situation were to materialize and these effects were to persist, they could have significant effects on the strength of aggregate demand going forward.  The process now under way in financial markets could take some time to resolve, and finding a new balance could take a while. We have modified our forecast in ways similar to the changes to the Greenbook.  We have a slightly weaker second half of ’07 and a slightly lower estimate of growth in ’08 and ’09, reflecting a downwardly revised estimate of potential growth.  Our growth numbers for ’07, ’08, and ’09 look roughly like 2½ rising to 2¾ percent.  Our inflation forecast is essentially unchanged, with core PCE inflation moderating to slightly under 2 percent over the forecast period.  Our differences with the Greenbook are not trivial, but they seem well within the somewhat greater uncertainty we now face about the outlook for growth.  The negative skew in our view of the risks to the outlook suggests a somewhat downward slope to the path of the fed funds rate going forward, to the appropriate stance of monetary policy, rather than the flat path assumed by the Greenbook.  So even if financial market conditions stabilize and credit markets, particularly the mortgage markets, find equilibrium relatively soon and start to open up again, the growth risks have shifted a bit more to the downside around the lower expected path.  In contrast, if the disruption in credit markets persists and liquidity markets are further impaired, then we face the prospect of a significantly weaker path to aggregate demand. Inflation risks in our view, however, remain slightly tilted to the upside, but these types of risk are very different.  The inflation risks are modest and manageable.  We characterize them as skewed to the upside in part because of the differences across the Committee as to our desired individual long-run views about the inflation level, in part because of our differences as to what’s an acceptable period for bringing core inflation down to that objective, and in part because of different views about the structure of inflation dynamics in this economy.  The risks to markets and ultimately to growth are very different.  There’s a much longer negative tail in terms of the range of potential outcomes, and those risks are going to be harder for us to manage, partly because they depend on confidence.  Because of these differences, I think it’s hard to counterpoise these two risks against each other and assess the balance between them.  Of course, as always, we should weigh each by their probability, their effects, and our capacity to manage those effects.  I think that the probability of a bad inflation outcome has diminished from what we would have said two quarters ago and the probability of an adverse growth outcome has increased.  As I said, the latter risk is interesting and complicated in part because it might be harder to manage. I want to make two points in this regard.  First, a number of you have said that we want to see more evidence of adverse effects on aggregate demand before we change our view about the appropriate path of monetary policy.  I don’t really think that’s the right way to think about this.  If we took that approach, we’d inevitably be too late.  Just as we think about inflation risks by looking forward and looking at expectations, we need to be forward looking and thinking about the potential implications of these dynamics of financial markets on the growth outlook.  The information we have now about what’s happening in markets and about the implications for credit markets and ultimately for confidence and demand is very stale and uneven.  My second observation about this challenge is that what makes it hard is partly that you are seeing a combination of things.  You are seeing a loss of confidence in the capacity of investors to assess underlying risk in mortgage markets in part because of uncertainty about what housing prices are going to do and in part because of uncertainty about correlations in losses across households.  You are also seeing a collapse in confidence, as Bill described it, in how to value complex structured credit products, probably from the loss of faith in ratings and from the changes ahead in ratings methodology and in actual ratings. You’re also seeing the difficulties that investors and counterparties now have in evaluating the risk in exposure to financial counterparties, and you’re seeing in some ways reflecting all of this a diminished willingness to finance what’s relatively high quality paper.  We live in a system in which risk has been transferred much more broadly, but a lot of that risk has gone to leveraged funds that have much less capacity to absorb this kind of shock without facing a lot of liquidity pressures.  The combination of these things means that you’re seeing some impairment in the natural dynamic by which, when prices adjust, you have new people coming in willing to buy at those low prices.  But these challenges in information and in diagnosing what’s happening in markets mean that the process is not working as quickly as you might have thought in mortgages and in high-yield corporate credit.  You can see this sort of skew in the risks reflected, I think sensibly, in the change of market expectations about the fed funds rate.  You can see this balance in the distribution that Bill described, where you see a sharply negative skew in expectations about the path on the downside, and you see that come also in the context of relative stability of inflation expectations.  That shift of mean expectations, in the distribution, does not come with any sense that the consequence might be some erosion in confidence about our capacity to keep inflation expectations down. Now, in terms of policy, I personally wouldn’t want to lean against the change in market expectations that we’ve seen so far, even though it has moved a long way in a short time.  It’s really important to give ourselves more flexibility than we now have to respond to what could be a rapidly deteriorating overall environment; that’s just pragmatically essential, given that the range of foreseeable monetary policy actions we’re likely to confront has broadened very substantially relative to where we were a quarter ago.  The challenge, of course, is to figure out a way to acknowledge and to show some awareness of these changes in market dynamics without feeding the concern, without overreacting, about underlying strength in the fundamentals of the economy as a whole or in the financial system.  That is a difficult balance, but I think it requires some softening of the asymmetry in our assessment of the balance of risks now. An advertisement in response to a bunch of points made so far, including by President Fisher—the Morning Call that Bill Dudley’s staff runs from New York is a very good, fairly textured prism of what’s happening across these markets.  They do a good job of trying to integrate a bunch of the anecdotes and the facts, and it’s the most efficient device any of us have to check in about that evolving balance.  It won’t satisfy everybody’s demand to have as much information as is out there, but it’s a fairly efficient way to get a pretty good picture, and so I commend that to you. It’s a really good, thoughtful, and reasonably deep collection of wisdom in the markets today."
"379";"CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  President Fisher.,   Thank you.  The news about the Italian strike is concerning me considerably.  [Laughter],   President Fisher, you raised a legitimate issue, which I think I should address now.  We will this afternoon be discussing this auction credit facility with a possible swap that would allow the Europeans to provide term dollar funding as well.  This work has been going on for a few weeks.  It has been very intensive.  The staff has done a great job, but as you know and as Bill explained, the financial market conditions have improved somewhat in the past few days, and so we view it—I view it and I think the Board views it now—as a relatively close call as to whether such a facility is needed at this juncture.  What I would propose to do is discuss it as planned on the agenda.  We would like to have a thorough discussion and, if the Committee approves the contingent permission, to use it should market conditions appear, in our judgment, to warrant it.  But just because, as you point out, there is some interaction with the monetary policy decision, I’d just like to say that, at this point, it is not by any means a certainty that we will go ahead and apply that particular agency.,   Sure.  President Plosser.,   Thank you.  President Yellen.,   Thank you.  President Rosengren.,   Thank you.  President Pianalto.,   Thank you.  President Lockhart.,   Thank you.  President Lacker.,   Thank you.  President Evans.,   Thank you.  Let’s put President Poole between us and the coffee break.  President Poole.  [Laughter]  Sorry.,   Before.  Go ahead.,   Thank you.  Sorry to have put you on the spot there.  It is 11:10.  Why don’t we take a break until 11:30?  Thank you. [Coffee break],   President Stern.,   Thank you.  Vice Chairman Geithner.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you, and thank you all.  Let me just briefly summarize and make a few additional comments.  Financial market conditions were a key theme of our discussion today.  Recent developments in financial markets have been reflected in reduced willingness to take risk and in tighter credit conditions.  Bank balance sheets are a potential constraint on credit extension.  Participants were unsure about how long these conditions would persist, but the repricing of risk seems likely to be persistent.  The tighter credit conditions will very likely weaken an already very weak housing market, as nonprime borrowers are rationed out and jumbo mortgage borrowers pay higher premiums.  Mortgage rate resets and foreclosures pose further risks.  Industries related to housing are naturally showing weakness. However, creditworthy borrowers are able to obtain credit.  Second-quarter and third-quarter GDP figures may be solid, but even so there have been some signs of slowing in the economy, even before the financial market developments, notably in the labor markets and in housing. Auto output is also on the weak side.  Labor markets do remain tight, and in general Main Street has been far less affected thus far than Wall Street.  Consumer spending continues to grow along with incomes, and net exports remain strong.  Financing should continue to be available for capital investment.  There were some regional differences in soundings on business confidence and expectations, but in any case, uncertainty has increased.  Some of the key questions include whether the further weakness of housing will spread to consumer spending; whether credit tightness will affect sectors other than housing, including the household sector and commercial real estate; and whether the labor market will continue to slow.  There is a general view that downside risks to output have increased with some very bad scenarios at least conceivable. However, others noted the resilience of the U.S. economy and the fact that previous financial crises had not necessarily reduced growth.  Inflation has moderated somewhat, and more participants view the risk to inflation as closer to balance.  Inflation expectations remain stable, and cyclical slowing is likely to reduce the pressure on resources.  However, tight labor markets, strong foreign demand, high oil prices, and other pressures still do exist. Are there any questions or comments?  Let me just make, as I said, a few extra comments here.  More so than usual, we have to look forward rather than backward.  We have to try to assess how these recent developments change the outlook, and that is very difficult.  To me, the critical elements to look at are housing and labor markets.  I think the interaction of those two sectors will determine the dynamics of the economy.  There has been some discussion about the fact that in 1998 there was very little effect of the financial markets on the real economy.  There was no obvious channel of effect in that episode.  In this case, there is, I think, a pretty clear channel of effect through mortgage lending, and we have already seen changes in availability of mortgages and changes in cancellations, sales expectations, and the like.  I would note that there are also—as you can see in the consumer confidence numbers, for example—expectations on the buyer side.  If buyers think that the housing market is going to be very weak, they will be less likely to want to get into it.  Finally, credit availability to homebuilders may also be an issue.  So I think there is pretty much a consensus that the housing sector will take another leg down based on financial market conditions.  I mention parenthetically that I have some concerns also about a few other areas, notably commercial real estate, and perhaps others like consumer credit and autos as well; but, again, I think the focus should be on housing. On the labor side, I think we can parse the job report numbers in some detail.  For example, on the one hand, the August report was not quite as weak as the markets thought it was. On the other hand, it revised down some previous numbers.  So overall there seems to be a sense that labor markets were slowing a bit before the financial crisis.  Even so, we have been expecting weakening in labor markets for some time, and I think now that the odds of that are really quite high.  I do expect to see continued expansion in construction layoffs.  There are losses of jobs, obviously, in mortgage finance and other related areas.  So I don’t know how quickly the labor market will weaken, but I do believe that it will weaken over the next couple of quarters. Now, those are two predictions.  Then the question is, What is the interaction between those two things?  I think there is potential for a negative feedback cycle, which is of some concern.  If labor markets weaken, particularly if they weaken severely in certain local areas, it will hurt house prices through two mechanisms.  First, house prices capitalize employment and other economic opportunities in an area, so house prices will fall as economic activity slows. Second, the demand for housing or the ability to make house payments directly depends on labor income.  Working in the other direction, as house prices fall, the normal wealth effects, but also possible precautionary saving effects or other liquidity effects, could begin to affect consumer confidence and consumer spending, and we get the makings of a potential recessionary dynamic that may be difficult to head off.  That is the scenario that concerns me.  I don’t know if it’s the modal scenario, but I think it’s one we need to watch very carefully. Beyond that scenario, there are further tail risks.  As a number of people have mentioned, most recently Governor Mishkin, these financial effects—financial accelerator effects, if you will—can be quite nonlinear.  The Greenbook has a 2 percent decline in house prices in each of the next two years.  It’s very possible that the decline could be greater than that.  Even if it’s not greater than that, it will not be uniformly distributed around the country.  In some parts of the country, house price declines will be much more significant.  The nonlinearity I’m talking about has to do with the distribution of equity among families.  If you have a 10 percent decline in house prices and two families, each of which has 50 percent equity in their home, then each family is going to experience basically the normal wealth effect.  But if one family has 100 percent equity and the other has 5 to 10 percent equity, the effects on behavior will not be linear. There will be a bigger effect on the family that finds itself in financial stress, and the possibility exists that weakening in these markets could feed back into some of the financial problems we are seeing.  So I am concerned about getting ahead of what could be an adverse dynamic between the job market and the housing market. On inflation, I think the slowing that we are likely to see will probably remove some of the upside risk that we have been concerned about.  I don’t know how these housing developments will affect owners’ equivalent rent.  We saw some perverse effects last time.  They are still possible.  A very small piece of information is that the PPI numbers yesterday actually had some favorable news in them in terms of both intermediate goods and medical costs.  So the near term still looks to be fairly good.  But I don’t dismiss inflation risks by any means, and we know that policy changes can work through expectations as well as through resource pressure, and so I consider that to be a serious concern.  Nevertheless, I do at this point think the principal risks are to the downside, and the interaction between different components of the economy presents the biggest challenge in that respect.  I will stop there.  Brian, if you are ready to introduce the policy alternatives now."
"380";"MR. EVANS.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To date, economic conditions in the Seventh District have changed little since our last meeting.  We continue to expand at a modest rate, as reported in the Beige Book two weeks ago.  Even after accounting for continuing declines in the housing sector, most of my contacts thought the national economy had softened.  Outside of housing, they generally reported a modest deceleration rather than an abrupt change in conditions.  Retailers thought that continued high energy prices were holding back consumers, but demand was not seen as deteriorating sharply.  A similar slowing was reported on the hiring front.  For instance, Kelly and Manpower experienced softer demand for temporary workers, but again this was not characterized as a general pullback in hiring.  Many contacts added that finding skilled workers remained difficult, as President Fisher mentioned. In terms of the business outlook going forward, several directors and other contacts noted that many in the business community were apprehensive about the prospects for growth.  They were concerned that these worries might soon begin to weigh more heavily on actual spending. For example, in the motor vehicle sector, both Ford and General Motors cautioned that the August sales numbers overstated the underlying strength in demand for vehicles.  They thought some selective incentive programs had boosted the sales figures.  I asked all my contacts about the effects of the turmoil in credit markets.  Though it is still early, none of them thought that the recent financial turbulence was causing creditworthy nonfinancial firms to have unusual difficulty in finding adequate financing.  As several people have said, many business people suggested that the situation is much better than what they hear from financial commentators on Wall Street.  Of course, we heard many examples of difficulties from financial market contacts, and several have spoken about that already. Turning to the national outlook, three broad developments since our August meeting have influenced my views on the economic situation.  First, financial conditions have become more restrictive.  Second, the incoming data suggest a greater decline in housing and a somewhat weaker labor market.  Third, inflation prospects have improved to the point where my outyear projections are within a range that many participants would view as consistent with price stability.  These projections embed a path for the federal funds rate that is similar to the Greenbook assumption. With regard to financial conditions, I think it is useful to consider the situation relative to an assessment of a neutral or an equilibrium federal funds rate.  Taking into account the slower growth of structural productivity, a neutral rate is likely between 4½ and 4¾ percent.  The Greenbook-consistent rate is in this range.  Until recently, one argument for keeping the target funds rate at 5¼ percent had been to offset otherwise accommodative conditions.  As recently as June, we had very low risk premiums and ample liquidity for all types of private borrowing, including large commitments for private equity deals.  Now, of course, overall financial conditions have tightened and in some markets have turned very restrictive.  Clearly, this restrictiveness is a downside for growth.  Whether it is as large as ½ percentage point, as the Greenbook assumes, is uncertain.  In any event, the ongoing repricing of risk also adds a good deal of uncertainty to the forecast.  You all know it is very difficult to forecast the impact of such financial turbulence.  Recent history and Dave Stockton remind us of this.  In the early 1990s, restrictive credit due to depositories’ capital adequacy problems had a significant impact on real economic activity.  In contrast, in the fall of 1998, we thought financial conditions would impinge a good deal on the real economy, but 1999 turned out to be a very strong year for growth.  Bottom line—and we all recognize this—we need to be careful how we react to the current financial situation. Turning more specifically to the outlook for growth, our Chicago forecasts have tended to be somewhat more optimistic than the Board staff forecast, and we remain so.  That said, the incoming data have been softer than we expected.  So we marked down our assessment of residential investment again, but not as much as the Board staff did—again, and the decline in payroll employment caused us to lower our near-term outlook somewhat.  As long as the financial difficulties are contained, and that is our working assumption, we expect growth to return to potential by the second half of 2008, and we have a higher potential output growth rate than the Board staff.  However, I admit that the risks seem weighted to the downside of this projection. With regard to inflation, the improvement in core PCE inflation earlier this year appears to have a bit more staying power than we thought it might.  If aggregate demand does weaken, as expected, then there is less risk of inflationary pressures arising from constraints on resource utilization.  Energy prices, though, are a concern.  My contacts do not seem to have much difficulty passing cost increases through to their customers.  Overall, however, we have core PCE inflation edging down to 1.8 percent next year and remaining near that rate in 2009.  I see the risk to this inflation forecast, conditioned on the outlook for growth, as being fairly well balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"381";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Well, Mr. Chairman, with regard to our District, we continue to grow apparently faster than the rest of the country.  There are signs of overbuilding, particularly in the multiresidential and some commercial sector areas.  I will give you one data point that focuses the mind, and then I’d like to go on to a broader discussion.  In the city of Austin, Texas, between 2000 and 2007, fifty condominium units priced at $1 million or more came on the market.  Over that seven-year period, forty of them sold.  There are now more than 560 coming onto the market.  We have seen a significant boom in construction in all the major cities of our District, and that does give me pause.  Nonetheless, we continue to speed along, driven not so much by energy as by medicine and the service sector.  So I continue to expect that we will outpace the rest of the country.  We are seeing some decline in terms of advanced airline bookings as they affect our District, but they’re not that different from the rest of the United States. What I’d like to address is the broader issue.  Mr. Chairman, I am a little confused as to why we are talking about the economic situation and then skipping a beat before we talk about the proposed discount window facility.  I do see the two going hand in hand.  I’d like to suggest that we’re navigating a very narrow passage here in something of a fog.  David, I think, was honest about that.  On the one side is a serious risk of overcompensating in our navigational course and incurring a moral hazard or overcompensating for what is a perceived risk in uncharted waters.  On the other side, I think we run the risk of biting off our employment growth responsibility to save our inflation-fighting face.  So on the starboard shore we hear a siren called “Very Large Financial Institutions,” which infer that a reduction in the fed funds rate will rescue them from peril, however self-inflicted that peril may have been and despite the fact that they’re well capitalized according to the reports that we have put together.  On the other shore, we are relying on navigational charts or uncertain landmarks or—as you said, David—rudimentary tools that are giving us mixed readings. I’m going to argue today that we should ease by 25 basis points, Mr. Chairman—I’m just showing my hand early—and indicate through our words that we might tilt the rudder a bit further if needed. Further, I am going to argue that we should defer discussion of the new discount window, and we can get to that later.  My concern is that if we fail to ease, we risk steering into a recession, but if we shift the tiller too radically on the fed funds side, I believe that we risk tacking onto that siren call that I mentioned earlier and that we will indulge rather than discipline risky financial behavior. What I’m about to talk about I base on a rather in-depth sounding, just to kill the naval analogy once and for all in this discussion.  [Laughter]  I sent you and the Vice Chairman a list of the people I consulted.  It is also based on what we’re hearing from our economists in the District and in our Bank and, very importantly, on what the Greenbook and the Bluebook have said.  There is no question that our contacts report a slowing in the pace that occurs through the third quarter, and they do detect a pulling in of the horns in terms of cost controls; budgetary planning; and U.S. capital expenditures as opposed to foreign cap-ex, which they’re still planning to expand significantly—all in light of the press given to the subprime debacle, financial turmoil, and just a general sense of caution. However, there are some very bright spots, and I’m going to go through these at a bit of length because I think they’re important to recognize.  AT&T, for example, a local but significant company says, “We’ve had the best quarter we’ve had on the consumer side, and on the business side it’s the hottest August in history.”  Their average revenue per user has risen for the past two quarters after declining for the past two and a quarter years.  Texas Instruments, an international company, reports “continued growth on the consumer side, robust industrial growth”—I’m quoting their CFO—and “strong industrial demand” and is struggling to meet demand.  Just to go to the other extreme, Brinker International is a middle-income restaurant chain that employs 120,000 and operates throughout the country.  Other than weakness in Southern California and Florida, traffic increases in July and August, seasonally adjusted, were “the best in twelve months.”  Wal-Mart reports, according to their CEO for U.S. operations, that August was “a perfect retail month.” They’re experiencing no problems with suppliers and no shortage of supply inventory.  They are feeling cost pressures from China, which I’ll turn to in just a minute.  Disney reports record attendance in their theme parks, very high advanced bookings through next spring, and very strong broadcasting revenues.  We are hearing the same from the other broadcasters and companies like Time-Warner, and needless to say, Exxon is a happy place right now.  The law firms that we have begun to survey rather thoroughly, reminding ourselves that there are more lawyers than there are auto workers in America, are experiencing a boom in business.  In short, if you take the summary offered by the CEO of  Time-Warner, who also sits on a significant bank board, as many people know, he says, “I see softness but not precipitous change, whereas the bank board I sit on keeps yelling ‘Incoming.’”  From a real Main Street perspective, he said that the changes are marginal. Now, to be sure, there are some weaknesses being reported.  The one utility I talked to at length is TXU.  The housing market has left a bit of a slowdown in demand.  Hookups by big industrials, however—steel, aluminum, et cetera—are running very good loads according to their CEO.  UPS reports that the package line has been flat to slightly up, with a pickup occurring in July and August.  The volume declined 0.2 percent in the first and second quarters, yet that’s against a “gee whiz” first quarter of 2006.  July and August have picked up 0.8 percent.  According to their CFO, “We have not seen an impact from the credit crunch.”  The CEO of MasterCard reports a softening, but nothing falling off the cliff.  Then JCPenney, which is a middle-third retailer, sees retrenchment in discretionary spending, the so-called appointment shopping.  Their back-to-school season was one of the strongest they have seen recently.  If you dissect, say, Cisco’s and EDS’s data, you see a significant cutback in IT expenditures by financial institutions, which you would expect—what they call the “big box” financial houses, Citi, Morgan, et cetera—and yet, according to John Chambers, rock solid growth in commercial and service-provider categories.  In summary, underlying economic growth, from the standpoint of anecdotal evidence from the contacts I’ve talked to, is stronger than it would appear from the press or from most prognosticators.  I think that’s one important point to take into consideration. It is also very important, Mr. Chairman, to think of how people react to what they’re seeing. There’s no doubt an effort, if you’re worried about the future, to tighten up on cost of goods sold and to reduce your head count.  Yet everybody is complaining that there’s a massive shortage of labor in every one of the companies I spoke of but one.  The other thing is that you change your strategic approach.  One relief that’s been provided here is that the private equity firms have been taken out so that bids of, say, seventeen times EBITDA, which is an actual case, with no due diligence, are no longer the case.  Four of the companies I spoke with are now able to make strategic acquisitions, and they plan to proceed.  The point is that the economy is not grinding to a halt.  I won’t mention lawyers again in this discussion except here, but see how they’re being hired now. Akin Gump, very large firms—they are working on strategic acquisitions, and you can see a ramp- up in the volume that’s occurring there.  So I think that’s an important thing to consider. Another very important point to consider is that price pressures have not disappeared.  I believe they are being maintained by global demand.  I’m going to give you just a couple of reference points, and then I’ll stop.  As you know, I like to quote the Panamax shipping rates.  When we last met, the spot daily rate for a Panamax ship—again, the dry bulk carriers—was $59,000 a day.  Yesterday, it was $70,000.  Port utilization is running at a record high.  Why?  Asian demand. After ten years of deflation, the major retail sources from China, according to Wal-Mart and other interlocutors, report cost increases running at 2 to 4 percent.  After ten years of deflation, they’re now inflating slightly.  (Although I said I wouldn’t mention lawyers, but just so you know, for the first time in history in Los Angeles, New York, and Dallas, all beginning lawyers start at $160,000. I think they are raising it to $180,000 in all markets.)  Sara Lee—from an agflation standpoint I think this is important and I think we have to be aware of the public perception—just announced a 5 percent increase in the cost of bread, and they announced that they “may hike another 5 percent at the end of the month.”  The spread between wheat and corn, Mr. Chairman, is the widest it has been.  It is usually $2.00 to $2.50; it is now $6.00.  Cooking oil prices, milk prices—even the Italians went on a one-day strike to protest the price of pasta.  It wasn’t successful, but that’s what they did.  The firms respond by “weighting out” the increased prices by putting less in the package here in the United States.  I want to mention again that we’re hearing widespread reports of labor shortages, and I do worry, Dave, that it somehow just doesn’t square.  I think your report certainly was elucidating, but it does have implications for how fast consumption can fall off, if indeed we’re suffering from a labor shortage.  Finally, there are price pressures that ensue from the booming construction markets in China.  Chinese demand for skilled labor last year, year over year, was up 100 percent.  They’re building a huge shipbuilding market and so on. So, Mr. Chairman, I am concerned, first, that while we have made progress by any measurement, including our beloved trimmed mean measure of the PCE in Dallas, that we’re just beginning to make such progress and that there are risks out there and we need to acknowledge them.  They stem largely from global demand.  Second, I’m very concerned that we’re leaning the tiller too far to the side to compensate risk-takers when we should be disciplining them.  So I’m going to conclude not with a sailing analogy but with a football analogy.  I don’t think it’s time to throw a “Hail Mary” pass.  I think it’s time just to continue to move up the field, running the ball as we’ve been doing, and I would strongly recommend a rate cut of only 25 basis points and no more. If, indeed, we accompany it with a change in the primary credit facility, then I think we have to have a very serious discussion of how far we’re willing to go on the fed funds rate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   It didn’t work.,   Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I look forward to that discussion.  I didn’t know that.  If they are, indeed, tied together, then I would be making a very strong argument against a 50 basis point cut if it were tied at the same time to this facility.  So thank you very much for that clarity."
"382";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As far as where conditions are today, I’ll keep my remarks short since they don’t differ a great deal from the Greenbook, Part 2, and the remarks of others.  On the District itself, our District continues to do economically well.  Energy obviously is a strong factor.  For agriculture, we have even adjusted the earnings numbers up dramatically since February.  Manufacturing has shown strength in August, and services seem to be good.  The surveys we’re doing also suggest those are continuing to do reasonably well.  My outlook in terms of what the reaction is or what we’re seeing in the economy for the national economy is not unlike that, except that the data are more mixed, as described by others.  So I won’t go into that. The issue is not so much where we are.  It’s where we’re going to be six and nine months from now, and the issues around that are issues of uncertainty.  Banking conditions in our region, and I think more broadly, are good.  The issues there, as we will talk about later, are issues of balance sheets, liquidity, and such things, which are important considerations to the economy going forward.  That will be an important discussion.  As we survey our businesses looking forward, we see the effects of some of the uncertainty where people, in a broad cross-section, are saying that they have not pulled back on their capital spending or in their hiring plans generally but are in a little more of a wait-and-see mode.  So there is a tendency to want to hold back, and the effects of that are really up in the air.  I think that’s important for us to consider.  Also, we have seen backing- off from funding commitments that were there.  Just like others, we’re seeing that as well in our region.  As a result, looking forward, we have reduced our outlook, but not anywhere near as dramatically as the Greenbook.  I think that we will get through this transition and that the economy has enough momentum that it will go forward if confidence hasn’t been lost.  So I don’t have quite as pessimistic an outlook going forward. The other element is the inflation outlook, and I think that inflation should remain relatively modest.  The thing that struck me is that the real rate has increased as inflation has come down over the past year since we last held, and so real rates are actually tighter.  That should have a favorable effect on the inflation outlook and also its own slowing effect in the economy, and I think that will be a very important part of our discussion going forward.  With that, I’ll just stop for the time being."
"383";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The repricing of risk and rechanneling of credit flows under way I believe will exert restraint on spending, especially in the near term, but over the longer run as well.  A critical channel of contagion that came into play in the intermeeting period was the involvement of the banks as providers of credit and liquidity backstops in the ABCP market.  As a consequence, uncertainties about real estate markets, the performance of nonprime mortgages, and structured-credit products came to rest as greater uncertainty about bank exposures.  The classic flight to safety under way—the desire to protect capital and liquidity—has caused banks and those providing them credit to become more cautious.  This has resulted in greatly reduced funding in term markets spreading the constriction of credit potentially well beyond the mortgage and leveraged-loan markets we talked about in early August. Like so many around the table, I feel that I can honestly say that the uncertainties around the output forecast were indeed larger than usual this time.  Fortunately, we don’t have many degrees of freedom to test hypotheses about the sorts of relationships that we’re talking about here.  I think we can expect effects on spending to be greatest in the short and intermediate terms, while markets are disrupted and while participants are struggling to find new ways of intermediating credit that address the perceived shortcomings of the previous practices.  In the short run, to preserve capital and liquidity while secondary markets are impaired, banks have tightened terms and standards for loans.  You can see this directly in the rise in spreads in the prime jumbo market, but it must be true for other less easily observed credits as well.  Some credits, such as nonprime mortgages and leveraged loans, just haven’t been available for a while. An already weak housing market has been most directly affected, and construction sales and prices will probably fall substantially further because of the reduced demand along with a large overhang of unsold homes.  Consumption spending is also likely to be trimmed.  Tighter terms for home equity lines of credit and second mortgages mean not only that housing wealth is declining but also that it is probably less liquid and more expensive.  To the extent that asset- backed security markets are affected and lenders have questions about consumer balance sheets, the cost of consumer credit could well rise also.  Household confidence has apparently been affected by the adverse financial market news.  Investment spending may also be held down by uncertainty, by a sense that consumer demand will be growing less rapidly.  I have been struck in listening to presidents around the table report about their Districts that the tone has shifted noticeably toward less optimism, slower growth, and more caution on the part of our business respondents.  It has been one of those shifts that you hear every couple of years around the table that are different from what might have been anticipated, say, from reading the Beige Book. There is also some tightening of credit conditions in the business sector—for example, for commercial real estate credit, as some have noted, and for credit for below-investment-grade firms. As a consequence, some downshift in GDP is highly likely over the next few quarters, and without policy action, we would most likely end up with a substantially lower GDP a few quarters out.  Indeed, in the Greenbook, the output gap is noticeably wider at the end of ’08 despite near-term policy easing of 50 basis points.  I also noted downside risk to my output forecast.  It seems to me that, in this period when markets are adjusting, those risks are most skewed.  The potential for adverse interactions seems large, as nervous creditors assess the implications of declines in house prices, volatile earnings of commercial and investment banks, and setbacks in overall confidence.  I think there is a non-negligible risk that the constrictions in credit availability would feed back on the economy and, in turn, feed back on credit supply.  As market participants are better able to distinguish and assess risk, liquidity will be re-established in many markets.  Although we have seen some improvement in the past week or two, markets are still quite dysfunctional in many regards.  Like others, I think it could take a while to discover how to structure securitizations that have the requisite transparency and appropriate principal-agent incentives to restore investor confidence and to recalibrate the roles of securities markets and banks.  The process could be particularly drawn out in mortgage and related markets, which are likely to be affected for some time by uncertainties about the prices of houses and about the performance of mortgages.  Moreover, some effects of the recent turmoil will be longer lasting.  Risk spreads in a great variety of markets are likely to be at higher, more- realistic, and more-sustainable levels; banks should be charging more for credit liquidity backstops; less leverage in the financial sector implies a need for return on the greater amount of capital involved in intermediation, including at banks; and some credit conditions at any given fed funds rate will be tighter one year from now than they were a few months ago. I have concentrated on problems for growth, but the upside inflation risks have not disappeared.  Unit labor costs have been rising.  Markups, while still high, have come in, affording a reduced cushion for absorbing labor costs.  Resource utilization remains high by historical standards.  Import prices may prove problematic.  Although commodity prices may level out as in the staff forecast, foreign economies also are producing at high levels.  Pressures on the costs of finished goods could increase, especially if the dollar declines further.  My expectations for the most likely path for inflation have been revised just a tick lower, given the favorable incoming data and the lower path for economic activity relative to potential, which will increase competitive pressures in labor and product markets.  For now, given this outlook, we need to concentrate on the potential effects of the disruptions to financial markets on the real economy when we consider policy in the next portion of this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"384";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  Obviously, I agree with virtually everyone around the table that some of the downside risks have increased, and it’s important to think about them in terms not just of the overall average but of tail risks.  As Vice Chairman Geithner pointed out, one of the responsibilities we have overall is for thinking about macroeconomic and financial stability, and so we have to take into account those tail risks.  Even if they may not change the mean or the median forecast that much, it is important that we think about those downside scenarios.  Obviously, the chance of those has increased.  Now, whether that is likely is something we will continue to discuss.  Some of those channels through which this could be happening are from the real sector in housing, concerns about information in subprime markets leading to broader problems in the markets.  I’d like to characterize the markets as being brittle. That is, they are in a state such that a little pressure here or a little pressure there has the potential to cause some cracks.  Many markets are functioning, but some are not functioning very well, and there is always the potential for something else to come along the line, even just a small amount of pressure.  We saw that what really initiated things right after our FOMC meeting was BNP Paribas’s announcement.  That gets back to something that Karen Johnson said earlier in one of these things.  It was hard to know that it was coming, and it would have been hard to know that it would have the kind of effect that it seemed to have of leading to a revaluation of September 18, 2007 84 of 188 risks not just in the subprime sector but much more broadly.  So I think we have to be very mindful of the brittleness of these markets. I do think that the numbers that have come in, looking in the rearview mirror, are pretty strong.  Looking forward, there is more uncertainty, as Dave and others have mentioned.  We obviously have the housing market problems, and we have the challenges in the labor markets. To throw something in from an anecdotal survey, although it’s a fairly systematic survey—at Duke they surveyed 600 CFOs of major corporations, and they asked a series of extra questions. The survey was done in August, and so it was filled out by the end of August.  We don’t know exactly when they filled these out, but they had to be in by the end of August.  Asked about the financial market turmoil, three-quarters of the CFOs said that it had no direct effect on them, but only 40 percent said that they were taking no action because of the financial market turmoil. A third of them said that they were going to be reducing capital spending, and 15 percent said that they were going to be reducing hiring.  This is not just of the one-quarter who said that there would be direct impact but of everyone, three-quarters of whom said that there would be no direct impact. But they said that they were reducing capital spending plans and hiring plans.  So this uncertainty could have real effects from these channels that we haven’t yet seen. Also, for what it’s worth, though I guess it’s more relevant for the next round, one of the questions was, “Would you be helped by a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate?”  A resounding 45 percent said no.  Less than one-third said that it would be more than a moderate help to them, but that’s something we’ll get to in a bit. One thing that I want to do—it has been important in my thinking and was also raised by a few people—is look at the parallels and differences with 1998 because that is the closest widening of the on-the-run, off-the-run Treasury spread, actually, much larger in 1998 than we have seen recently; a plunge in short-term yields; and a very strong desire for short-term Treasury paper—exactly as we have seen in both cases, although greater volatility in that short- term market today than in 1998 and higher volatility with respect to the equity markets today than in 1998.  Spreads also moved up—term spreads, swap spreads, and CP spreads went up quite dramatically, although in certain types of CP spreads a little bit less back then than today. An interesting thing I noted in going back and looking at the old memos, which were created I think by some of the people who are in the room now, was that one thing that brought the CP market back in 1998-99 was not an innovation but the dramatically greater use of something that had only just started to be used—asset-backed commercial paper—providing collateral that helped people to feel confident that they could buy this commercial paper and something would be there.  So it is sort of ironic to see that the challenge today was the innovation that, to some extent, saved the CP market back then.  We are seeing the same kind of swelling of bank balance sheets today that we were back then—an enormous amount of liquidity coming into the banking system.  In terms of the macro shocks, there are some parallels and differences.  We came into the summer of ’98 with an economy that was growing reasonably strongly, exactly the time of those productivity shocks that weren’t fully understood.  Some people had the intuition that those productivity shocks were going to be strong, but they were stronger than the Greenbook and, I think, any of the private-sector economists had anticipated.  There was also an important international shock, which we don’t have now, and there was also a very strong policy response, which helped provide liquidity in the emerging markets.  Interestingly, there was a policy cut of 75 basis points in a fairly short period of time.  We will get to that in the second round. But something that I think is different is that the source of the uncertainty, at least so far as market participants were concerned, was really focused very much on (1) the international markets and (2) LTCM.  The interventions in the international markets through the IMF, the World Bank, and others were helping to respond to some of those.  There was the working out in September, actually before any of the FOMC rate cuts occurred, to try to settle the LTCM issue. But being able to focus on the source of the uncertainty as the market participants perceived it back then was very important.  I think we have a much greater challenge today because the source of uncertainty is really a change in the whole model of how these markets are operating. In the old days, we used to know where the risks were; unfortunately, we knew that they were all on the bank balance sheets.  With the originate-to-distribute model and securitization, we have been able to move to a different model in which the risks are much more dispersed.  Not all of them are on the bank balance sheets, although some of them are certainly going to be coming onto the bank balance sheets, so the banks never fully get out of this.  But it leads to potential pockets of uncertainty, and that is exactly what has come up.  People don’t have as much information as they thought they had.  They were relying on traditional rating agencies and on other sources that were perfectly fine for traditional credits but more of a challenge for the newer credits.  So I have sometimes said to market participants who talk about this, “Well, you know, you were too trusting of those ratings, and I think now you’ve learned that Ronald Reagan was right.  ‘Trust, but verify’.”  Thus there’s a lot more that is being spent on trying to verify what the value of credits is in these markets.  You can see that as being somewhat inefficient because now everybody has to do that individually rather than just rely on a centralized credit-rating agency, but obviously there are questions about the effectiveness of that credit-rating agency. That is one reason that I see a slow recovery in some of these markets—market participants realize that they didn’t have the information they thought they had.  They are now going to have to invest much more in getting that information.  I think one thing that has been important in the actions we have undertaken is to provide liquidity and support so that people should feel it is worthwhile to make the investment, to do the due diligence, and to try to understand that they need to verify the ratings or other things that are out there. The banking system, as has been mentioned, is in a good state, but I don’t want to overstate that because there are challenges in bringing things onto the bank balance sheets.  As was mentioned, a lot of capital is above the regulatory minimums, but there is a reason that banks hold capital above their regulatory minimums:  They are concerned about ratings. Regardless of what people may say about rating agencies these days, they are still sensitive to that.  Banks are worried about making sure that they are perceived as having sufficient capital and sufficient liquidity.  So one shouldn’t just say, “Well, you can use up all that capital.”  With the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, we have tried to add up the maximum amount of SIV conduits; the ABCP that could come onto the books, which is potentially in the hundreds of billions of dollars; and the amount of leveraged-loan commitments, which is about $280 billion to $300 billion just for the four or five major banks alone.  That still doesn’t bring you to say capital falls below “well capitalized,” but that is not where their banks want to be.  So I do think that the banks would react if these things started coming onto their books.  In addition, we did some investigations with the OCC through the Shared National Credit Program.  We pulled records on about 900 credits at the major institutions to try to see what the underwriting standards were.  We found—or I should say that the examiners found—that about 23 percent of those were considered to have weak underwriting standards.  Now, that doesn’t necessarily mean that there are going to be problems or losses, but it was much higher than had been expected. About 28 percent of those were on U.S. banks and 26 percent on foreign banking organizations, but almost half of them were on nonbank organizations.  I don’t want to overemphasize the challenges to the banks, but there still may be these pockets of weaknesses out there that we are not sure about. What that brings me to, in thinking of where we are, is that we have gotten into a very good situation from a risk-management point of view.  By holding the line and being very credible on inflation, we have seen core numbers decline over the past three to six months and in a fairly consistent way, exactly as Jeff Lacker said.  Even as the markets have dramatically reevaluated where they think policy is going to go in the short and intermediate terms, we have seen very little change in market expectations of inflation.  That gives us a lot more potential to be able to move forward.  Also, from a risk-management and insurance perspective, what if the economy does take off?  What if it is 1998-99?  I have some numbers that the staff provided to me.  In the November 1998 FOMC meeting, which was the last time they raised interest rates, real GDP was forecasted at 3.3 percent for ’98, and it turned out to be 4.5.  They were predicting 1.6 percent growth for ’99; it actually turned out to be 4.7.  But the key from my perspective is what happened to inflation, because one way of thinking about it is, What is the steepness of the Phillips curve?  There may be other explanations for this.  The Greenbook forecast for the November FOMC meeting was 2.4 percent for core CPI inflation in ’98, and the Greenbook was spot on.  That’s what it was in ’98.  The Greenbook was forecasting 2.2 for ’99.  It turned out to be 2 percent.  It was actually lower than it had been and than was forecasted.  So even with a 75 basis point increase, even with very little effect on the macroeconomy, it turned out that there was not much of a tradeoff, not much of a loss in buying that insurance.  That heartens me as we go into the next round to think about the policy choices.  Thank you."
"385";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent information from the Fifth District, both from contacts and from our survey responses, suggests that growth in economic activity in our District has slowed in recent weeks.  The survey indicates that retail sales have weakened, with big-ticket categories such as automobiles and building materials leading the way.  Shopper traffic has trailed off somewhat as well.  Services firms report slower revenue growth and less optimism about demand going forward. Activity in some District housing markets has slowed markedly in the past two to three weeks, and some formerly healthy markets are now showing signs of weakness.  One contact in Charlotte, for example, says that sales agents there are saying the same things they were saying in Atlanta several months ago.  Residential foreclosures are more widespread, though they appear to be concentrated or overrepresented among investors rather than owner-occupants. Mortgage activity has fallen off in the past several weeks, according to our contacts.  While standards have tightened for marginally qualified applicants, it is reported that mortgages remain readily available for creditworthy borrowers.  The CEO of a nationwide title insurance company reports that their open orders have been trending down in recent weeks.  He also says that they are seeing an increase in cancellations of title insurance orders because people are applying for more than one mortgage in the current climate. In contrast, commercial real estate conditions appear generally healthy, although recent reports suggest that closer scrutiny is being given to marginal project proposals.  Conditions in manufacturing also look positive, shipments and new orders continue to expand, and hiring indicators for this sector have edged higher.  District price pressures remain at about the same level they have been in recent months. Let me say that, broadly speaking across our contacts, we have heard in the past week or two more reports mentioning a sense of gloom.  This echoes what Presidents Pianalto and Lockhart said.  On the other hand, one contact in Charlotte, who has had a lot of successful experience in real estate markets, said that compared with past crises this is a walk in the park. Maybe that is just because he has made his.  It may be particular to this situation, so I don’t want to make too much of that. The national economic data that we have received since our last meeting point pretty clearly to a weaker economic outlook for real growth.  The employment report is a prominent example.  Slower growth in the months ahead would weigh on income growth and consumption, although the Greenbook’s outlook for income remains pretty healthy.  Recent reports on housing activity have also been quite disappointing.  I think the key question is the effect on the housing market and broader economic activity of the recent financial market turmoil.  I won’t survey what has happened; Presidents Yellen and Rosengren and Mr. Dudley did an excellent job on that.  I will just comment that it seems, broadly speaking, as if we are on a traverse from a configuration of intermediation that placed a fairly heavy reliance on fairly complicated and structured products and rating agencies’ assessments of those.  It is a traverse that is obviously going more rapidly and is fraught with more peril than the path that took us to the configuration we are coming from.  So it is hard to know how much of an effect this turmoil will have on housing.  I suspect that a lot of the slowdown was already in train before the middle of August.  I base that thought on the fact that many mortgage rates rose earlier in the summer than August, though the jumbo market is an obvious exception to that. Beyond housing, any projections of real effects from events in financial markets seem like guesswork at this point.  My sense is that, while we may see some marginal slowing in business investment, the effects are likely to be small because I don’t think the marginal cost of funding for most businesses has gone up much and we aren’t hearing reports of wholesale tightening of lending standards in the corporate sector.  I haven’t heard that from around the country either.  I expect consumer spending to grow more slowly than in recent years, but not too dramatically so.  I think that there is a fair amount of uncertainty about the size of the housing wealth effect and that household net worth overall remains fairly high relative to income at this point.  As I noted earlier, the Greenbook’s projection for disposable income isn’t too bad, so that would support consumption growth at least at a moderate pace going forward.  Overall, then, I come out a touch above the Greenbook, with real growth about 2 percent in the second half and then gradually returning to trend.  Of course, I have been expecting less of a slowdown than the Greenbook for about a year now.  It turns out that, although we have both been too optimistic, the Greenbook has been closer to reality, so my confidence in my forecasting ability is waning here. The inflation numbers have been encouraging.  Core PCE inflation averaged under 1.4 percent for the past five months, and overall PCE inflation was under 2 percent for both June and July.  I am particularly pleased that TIPS inflation compensation has not increased even as market participants have marked down their expected funds rate path in the midst of the recent turmoil.  That said, it still looks as though market participants expect inflation to settle near 2 percent rather than lower, as I would prefer.  That concludes my remarks."
"386";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the Sixth District, we indulge ourselves with the conceit that our District looks a lot like the nation as a whole.  We have 45 million consumers and an industrial composition that does resemble the country, so you can process my regional remarks with that conceit in mind.  Housing markets continued to deteriorate in August in the Sixth District.  Housing market weakness was most pronounced in Florida, as you might expect, followed by Atlanta and middle Tennessee.  The consensus view is that the recent tightening in mortgage credit availability will exacerbate the region’s housing market problems, and most regional contacts believe that housing markets will continue to weaken, bottoming out no earlier than mid-2008, and some see a much longer adjustment period. Aside from housing, real economic readings in the Sixth District were mixed.  Anecdotal feedback across a number of industries suggested that business spending has not yet slowed markedly, but the majority of contacts indicated that they are now approaching new capital spending more cautiously.  That said, most contacts acknowledge that tighter credit standards have not significantly affected business capital investment outlays.  Reports of factory activity were mixed, with defense and export industries doing well, while industries linked to housing were predictably weak.  Transportation contacts indicated ongoing weak domestic demand. Consumer activity in the District was flat to slightly up in August compared with a year ago. Housing-related home product sales were especially weak, as were auto sales.  Perhaps the most notable change from previous months was a turn to pessimism on the part of directors, reflecting their soundings of business contacts in their communities.  I will mention that we have five Branches, so we actually get director feedback from more than forty directors across the District. Sixty percent believe that economic activity will be slower six months out, twice the percentage recorded in July.  Even factoring out idiosyncratic conditions in localities such as south Florida and the Gulf Coast, the outlook, based on these anecdotal reports, has turned to the negative. To summarize my regional comments—current fundamentals are mixed, and the outlook is pessimistic.  In our view, the economic outlook has changed since the last meeting, and the balance of risk has clearly shifted to the downside.  We do not see a near-term recession as a high likelihood, but we do anticipate that growth will approach trend much more slowly with employment edging up as a consequence.  So in direction and tone, if not magnitude, we are in agreement with the Greenbook, but our forecast differs from the Greenbook baseline forecast in the depth of the below-trend growth, ours being somewhat milder because we condition our forecast on deeper cumulative cuts in the fed funds rate over the coming months. Turning to capital markets, my recent conversations with a number of capital market participants suggest that the adjustment process in financial markets is far from complete.  Their anecdotal feedback reflects a range of views about the severity of the current problems and the outlook for stabilization.  Here is the overall picture I gleaned from these conversations.  Some debt markets have firmed a bit.  The leveraged-loan market, for example, is likely to renew trading in the coming weeks, but structured-debt security markets are not yet clearing.  The principal reason—and this has been mentioned earlier by Bill and others—that debt markets remain illiquid is weak counterparty transparency and, therefore, uncertain counterparty risk, as well as uncertainty regarding the performance of collateral pools that back securities.  The process of achieving adequate clarity and stabilization of the markets will likely take many more weeks.  Markets will remain volatile while the condition of heightened uncertainty persists. There has been some spillover into markets that are unrelated to structured debt and subprime, but creditworthy borrowers are getting credit.  There is sufficient buyer liquidity currently on the sidelines awaiting greater clarity regarding counterparties, market pricing of securities, and the depth and scope of the difficulties.  Widespread deleveraging, particularly by SIVs and hedge funds and nonbank entities, is occurring and is likely to continue. One party argued, however, that all the news of financial distress has not pushed risk spreads to the extremes of historical bands.  This party argued, “We are experiencing a painful adjustment from excessively high leverage to more-rational or more-realistic pricing in line with historical averages.”  But all contacts believe—and this is perhaps not unexpected—that prolonged credit market problems will affect the broad economy, mostly through the consumer credit channel. So I believe our decision today boils down to whether we cut ¼ percentage point or ½ percentage point, obviously in combination with careful wording of the statement that conveys a rationale focused on economic fundamentals while signaling some recognition that the problems in the capital markets have the potential to deliver a credit shock to the broad economy. I consider it appropriate to adjust the federal funds rate to the now-weaker economic outlook, and I support a 50 basis point move with the rationale that at least 25 basis points of that represents recognition of a lower equilibrium rate and the remainder is a preemptive, preventive measure designed to renew confidence, facilitate conditions that resolve uncertainty, and shorten the necessary adjustment timeline in a deleveraging financial sector.  It is a fair question whether the process of information revelation—that is, removing uncertainty—will be accelerated by an aggressive rate cut.  My view is that this action, along with other liquidity actions, removes the psychological barrier—that being the concern that the Fed might fail to ensure enough upfront liquidity and might be pursuing an inadvertently tight policy, compounding problems by putting undue stress on the real economy.  I think a distinction can be drawn between trying to influence the psychology around dangerous financial sector circumstances and bailing out the markets, and care should be taken to reflect this in the minutes. Let me add that I agree with the earlier comments of President Fisher that we perhaps should be looking at any policy move in the context of a total package that includes the auction credit facility.  So I do have, let’s say, some sympathy for the view that the total package must be discussed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"387";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  It’s a question of how desperate you are.  [Laughter],   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Clearly, the key issue in thinking about where the economy is and what we need to do about policy is the financial destruction that is going on right now.  When I look at it, I think about the different episodes that we’ve had in the post-World War II period and separate them into two sets of episodes.  There’s the episode of 1970 with the Penn Central crisis, there’s the 1987 stock market crash, there’s the 1998 LTCM episode, and then, of course, the World Trade Center terrorist tragedy in 2001.  That’s one group. In those contexts, there was a lender-of-last-resort operation.  It was active policy on our part, and it did resolve the situation in the financial markets very quickly.  The other episode is the early 1990s, when there was much more of a severe structural problem in which the banks got into trouble.  Therefore, it took quite a long time for them to fix their balance sheets in order to get players back into the financial markets to make loans to people who had good investment opportunities. When I look at the current episode, I see something in-between.  I do not think that in this case the situation can be resolved quickly because I think that the price discovery issues are severe.  In particular, we’ve gone to an originate-to-distribute model, which Governor Kroszner mentioned, and we have found some serious flaws in it.  The expectation is that we will have new models coming out.  In fact, I think that this is actually going to be a long-run profit opportunity for the banks.  So if we were allowed to buy bank stocks, I think it would be a good idea.  [Laughter]  But the key problem is that this is going to take a substantial amount of time, even if things go very well; in that context, there is a substantial negative shock to aggregate demand and, therefore, a substantially weaker economy.  However, the issue that most concerns me here is that, even though I think the modal forecast is that growth will be slower than we expected, the downside risk is actually very, very substantial.  Though we may not be allowed to mention it in public, we have to mention the “R” word because there is now a significant probability of recession.  The problem here is really the interaction of the financial side with the real side.  I’m worried that, as the economy becomes more nonlinear, we have the potential for a vicious circle or a downward spiral, whatever phrase you want to use—that, in particular, we have a financial disruption, which means that it’s harder to allocate capital to people with productive investment opportunities and, as a result, you get a contraction in economic activity. A contraction in economic activity makes information revelation or price discovery harder to do. That can then lead to more financial disruption, which leads to a downward spiral in terms of economic activity.  So the big issue here for me is that this nonlinear element is very real right now.  The question is what to do about it, and that’s what we will be discussing shortly. However, I think it is also important to recognize that inflation risks are just not that severe right now.  That’s the good news because it will allow us flexibility to deal with the situation.  In particular, we see inflation expectations that are very grounded, something that everybody has mentioned.  Also, even in the modal forecast and not worrying about the downside risks, the expected future output gaps are more negative, so we have less pressure going forward there.  I was happy that the staff slightly lowered the NAIRU estimate, which was consistent with my views in the past couple of cycles, when I thought that it might be a smidgeon under 5 percent.  I think their revision makes sense, and, again, it means that there’s a bit less likelihood of upside risk to inflation.  Then, also, there are the downside risks to real growth. When I look at the inflation situation, I do think that inflation expectations are grounded around 2 percent right now.  By the way, that’s not necessarily written in stone because things that we might do could actually change inflation expectations; but I think that we have to take inflation expectations as given right now.  However, I see that the risks are slightly to the downside from that 2 percent level because of the things that I’ve just mentioned.  The key point here is that we have a situation of potential nonlinearities, big tail risk, that could actually get very nasty, and in fact there is a potential for recession.  On the other hand, I don’t see that inflation risk is the big problem right now.  Thank you."
"388";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On balance, the data and the anecdotal evidence in our District say that the economy continues to expand and advance moderately, but the pace may have slowed somewhat since June.  Readings of our Business Outlook Survey of regional manufacturing have been very volatile this summer.  You may recall that in June, our activity index rose to 18, which was its highest value since April 2005.  The index fell to 9 in July and to 0 in August.  The September survey, conducted during the first two weeks of September, remains confidential and will not be announced to the public until this Thursday at noon—so these are really new data.  In fact, we finalized it only yesterday.  It indicates some recovery in general activity, new orders, and shipments.  The general activity index rose from 0 to 10.9.  New orders and shipments indexes also improved.  Another piece of good news from the manufacturers’ capital spending plans is that they remain positive, with the index at a level typically seen during expansions.  Plans to increase capital spending were common among nearly all the major manufacturing sectors covered by our survey.  Consistent with this, our respondents generally see improvements in their business activity coming over the next six months.  In September we asked a special question about whether the recent changes in the construction and financial sectors had any adverse effects on their business or their business plans.  About two-thirds of the respondents said there was no impact on their orders or shipments.  About 11 percent reported a substantial decline.  Most of these firms were housing-related industries.  One was in auto parts, and one was in apparel.  Similarly, three-quarters of the respondents had no change in their capital spending plans, and only about 9 percent expected to cut back substantially on their capital spending relative to plan over the rest of the year.  My reading of this is that the manufacturing sector in the region is holding up pretty well. In contrast, residential construction activity in the region continues to deteriorate, and we are expecting to see declines in house prices.  Earlier these declines were seen only at the Jersey Shore, but now they seem to have spread a little more widely in the District.  Interestingly enough, homebuilders reported reducing prices to stimulate sales but with relatively little success.  Several contacts told us that they were more concerned about the negative effects on buyer psychology of recent financial market developments than they were about the availability of mortgage financing. That our region has been largely less dependent on subprime lending than some other areas may be part of the reason for that.  Nevertheless, none of our contacts in the real estate industry were willing to forecast when the demand for housing was going to pick up.  Nonresidential construction has also softened somewhat in our region, as indicated by the value of contracts, but that’s a very volatile number.  These data tend to be revised up; but the decline still is quite pronounced, and it bears watching.  At the same time, vacancy rates remain very low in the Philadelphia area, and so the demand seems to be there, but the contracts are down for the moment. Employment growth over the three-state region ending in July remains below trend in New Jersey and Delaware and kind of flat in Pennsylvania.  Some firms continue to support what has already been said—difficulty in finding qualified workers.  One of our board members runs a temporary employment agency that goes through tens of thousands of people every month.  She said that there has been an uptick in walk-in traffic of people applying for employment, particularly skilled workers, but in fact, there has been no falloff whatsoever in the demand from firms looking for these people.  So she has seen no decline in demand for these workers, but she has seen a little uptick in the supply coming through their office.  Our three-state unemployment rate remains relatively low and below that of the nation.  Nonetheless, July unemployment rates in our three states were a little higher than we saw earlier in this year. The inflation picture for the District has changed little since our last meeting.  Wage increases have been moderate.  Several firms report large increases in benefit costs but not an acceleration of those benefit costs.  The prices of industrial goods are increasing, but retail price increases haven’t been as widespread as they were earlier.  In summary, our region’s inflation has not accelerated.  It hasn’t decelerated either. Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand, but its pace has perhaps slowed somewhat.  Our business contacts generally expect activity to remain slow but on an upward trend and are more uncertain about the outlook than they were, but their plans seem to be in place.  One board member spent a great deal of time talking to a number of CEOs and CFOs about capital spending plans, and it was funny.  He said that they said, well, everybody thought there was going to be a capital spending program reduction.  They weren’t planning a reduction, but they knew somebody else who was.  It was very hard to find the person who was actually doing it, but everybody thought that someone else was doing it.  So it was a little anecdotal. The national economy looks more vulnerable to me than it did six weeks ago, but it would be a mistake—and I think Dave Stockton did an excellent job of reminding us—to count out the resiliency of the U.S. economy at this early stage.  I think there can be a tendency in the midst of financial disruptions, uncertainty, and volatility to overestimate the amount of spillover that they will exert on the broader economy.  For example, the rate cuts after the stock market crash in 1987 were reversed fairly quickly.  Unfortunately, we have very little hard data as yet to help us gauge the potential size or persistence of the impact on real activity of the August turmoil, and early signs may be fraught with noise and overreaction to headlines.  So I think we have to be very careful. Of course, it is possible that disruptions will further restrain the already weak housing market by reducing the supply of mortgage credit.  Nonconforming mortgage rates, even to prime borrowers, remain elevated, but conforming rates to prime borrowers are actually lower right now. Reduced lending in the alt-A and subprime market is not a surprise.  It has been difficult to obtain those loans since the early part of this year, and I think that is not a big change.  The biggest surprise, at least for me, is that the impact on the obtainability of mortgages to homebuyers of the recent disruptions has been in the area of nonconforming jumbo mortgages.  Yet the availability of these mortgages and their rates are likely to settle back down more quickly to normal levels since most of the people borrowing at the jumbo rates tend to be closer to prime borrowers than to subprime.  However, as banks take some action to bring some of these risky assets back onto their balance sheets, we may look forward to further restraints on credit because they don’t want to push their capital ratios any harder than they have, and so that may have a diminishing effect.  But putting aside any financial market effects, signs of stabilization in the housing markets that we saw early this year just have not been sustained, as we all know.  Home prices have decelerated and have been falling in certain localities, and that’s likely to continue.  Incoming data suggest that the downturn in housing may be both more prolonged and somewhat deeper than certainly I had earlier anticipated. The question has been whether this decrease in housing wealth would spill over into consumer spending, regardless of the source of the decrease in housing wealth.  The argument has been that the strength in the labor markets and the stock market gains would continue, and continued personal income growth would buoy the consumer and mitigate those declines.  I remind everybody that, even though the market is down heavily in August, it is still up roughly 5 percent for the year.  So it wouldn’t be a tank unless something further happened. August nonfarm payroll surprisingly fell by 4,000 jobs in August, as we know.  I wouldn’t be too surprised to see this number revised up.  Loss of government jobs concentrated in local education took a very big hit, and this might be overstating the seasonal adjustment factors that are going into this in the timing of the starts of the school year.  Still, there was weaker private payroll growth.  There’s no question about that, and the revisions done in June and July were down substantially.  Thus, nonfarm payroll gains have averaged about 44,000 over the past three months, whereas private payrolls have been a little more than 70,000 for the past three months, and that’s weaker than we’ve seen during the rest of the year.  There’s no question about that. On the positive side, business spending remains fairly solid, but our hard data are somewhat stale and may be a little sketchy.  Although not in the data yet, there’s some risk of temporary weaknesses in business fixed investment going forward simply because of the increased uncertainty inherent in financial market disruptions.  So far most of the firms we’ve talked to, as I said earlier, say that their capital spending plans remain in place, and only a few nonmanufacturing firms have mentioned not canceling but just delaying them until the market has settled down.  Risk premiums have increased from abnormally low levels, which is probably beneficial.  This has raised the cost of capital for some firms; but for most firms, financing for capital spending remains available. Many banks say that they have lending available and that they will lend to good customers.  There’s not a problem.  Indeed, most capital expenditures by businesses, in fact, are internally financed, and so the turmoil in the credit markets may not have as much spillover on capital spending as we might otherwise expect.  So unless there’s a sharp decline in business sentiment, which could occur if the financial market turbulence worsens, I don’t expect to see that much of a pullback in business investment spending, except possibly in the very, very near term. On balance, I believe that within the forecast period we can see a return to trend growth, which I still estimate at about 2¾ percent, somewhat higher than the Greenbook.  I still think that’s the most likely outcome, but I now expect that return to be delayed by a couple of quarters given housing, and it won’t be under way until certainly late in 2008.  I admit there’s still considerable uncertainty surrounding that forecast, and I certainly see that there’s a possibility of particularly bad outcomes, some of which the Greenbook scenarios have laid out.  I also expect that some of the indicators we receive over the next few months are likely to be weak, but not necessarily weaker than many of us have already built into our new forecasts.  Indeed, because of the financial markets disruptions, the August data won’t be particularly helpful or useful in reading the trends in the economy. I think it’s going to be crucially important for us to convey to the public that we are forward looking, that we expect to see somewhat weaker data coming in, but that they may not necessitate a further change either in our forecast or in our policy.  Only when we accumulate sufficient new information that causes our forecast to deviate from our already lowered projections do we want to revise our forecast and perhaps our policy.  I think this is a point that we need to make very clearly to the public, if not in our statement, which we should try, then in the minutes and in our speeches as we go out.  I think it would be detrimental to our cause and to good policy if the public expected us to react to each piece of incoming data. On the inflation side, I see that recent readings on core inflation have moderated.  Headline inflation remains quite elevated.  I don’t think that we can afford to be sanguine.  I continue to see underlying inflation pressures, as has already been articulated.  Long-range inflation expectations have been stable, but I’m concerned as we go forward with potential rate cuts.  I’m concerned about their remaining stable, particularly when we may be lowering rates without being clear about what our inflation goals are.  Indeed, I think the current situation clearly shows the benefit of having an explicit inflation goal.  By anchoring those expectations, an explicit goal would mean less of a tradeoff between our two goals and so might make this policy decision easier and even perhaps more effective.  Thus, while my forecast has built in some near-term policy easing partly to offset the anticipation of tighter credit conditions, I believe that we might find ourselves in a position sometime during ’08 in response to rising inflation of having to raise the fed funds rate back up.  We need to be particularly careful now with our communications regarding any policy action we take, but I’ll save that discussion for the policy go-round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"389";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  After or before?,   Oh, before.  Okay.  I’m going to be brief.,   Speak for yourself.  I have just a few anecdotes here.  My contact in the trucking industry says that things are very, very glum there.  Volume is down 11 percent, year over year.  Shipping rates are down 5 percent, and this is very general in the trucking industry. We get the same story from the trucking side of FedEx and UPS.  But the small package side of FedEx and UPS is doing somewhat better.  In fact, the August and September numbers— September to date, obviously—are actually a little better than the July numbers.  They have not changed their outlook for the holiday season, and so it is not a real buoyant outlook, but they haven’t changed it at all in response to the financial market upset.  A contact in the fast food industry had an interesting comment that actually came out of Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart is reporting a very significant drop in money transfers to Mexico.  That is probably reflecting the number of Mexicans who work in the construction industry.  A contact with a major software firm is really completely different.  They are seeing very buoyant revenues.  They are seeing IT sales running above the Gartner forecast.  They track sales, and the weekly sales—this is as of Friday the week before last—were doing very well; in fact, they were accelerating.  A comment about the consumer market:  A new release of software for an apparently popular game has very strong pre-orders.  Business sector demand is uniformly strong across small, medium, and large businesses.  International demand is very strong.  There were no bad pockets in this business at all was the report that I received there. My summary view on the outlook is that, if the financial market upset goes away or settles down in a few weeks, the outlook for next year is going to appear more or less as it did last June before the financial market upset began, with of course some major exceptions or revisions.  Housing is, unambiguously, going to be weaker.  The nonprime market is gone, I think, for the foreseeable future.  Maybe some of the alt-A market would start to come back, but the subprime is gone for the foreseeable future, and housing-related goods—appliances and furniture—presumably are going to reflect the housing weakness.  If the market disruption continues, the fallout for the real economy will grow, and it is very hard to know how that might turn out.  As you were discussing, things like the surprises going on in the United Kingdom come along in a very unpredictable fashion with unpredictable results.  I view the Greenbook forecast as reflecting a mean with a certain probability of a stronger outcome, more like the one we had in June perhaps, and then, of course, a certain probability of a weaker outcome.  Our job is to raise the probability of that stronger outcome without raising the probability of higher inflation.  Thank you."
"390";"MR. ROSENGREN.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most of the economic data we have for this meeting reflect the economy before the liquidity issues in August.  The employment report, while probably not wholly reflective of the problems and affected by some anomalous seasonals, nonetheless provides evidence that labor markets were slowing at the outset of the financial problems.  Given the layoffs that are being announced by financial services firms and the potential for continued difficulties in construction, some further easing of labor markets seems quite likely.  Although we do not have housing starts and permits for August, the outlook for the second half of 2007 is likely to deteriorate further than forecasters had predicted before the liquidity issues.  There is good reason to believe the staff forecast that residential investment will remain weak well into 2008.  Stock prices of all the major homebuilders have continued to decline since our last meeting, and the credit derivative swaps for several of the largest homebuilders are at levels that reflect a very high probability of default. The news from the financial markets has improved marginally from the last meeting, but I still have some significant concerns.  Certainly, some of the financial anomalies have abated, such as the extremely low rates for short-term Treasury securities, and there are some tentative signs of improving liquidity.  However, these improvements are tenuous, and the ability to raise funds in a number of short-term financial markets remains quite difficult.  I would just highlight a few of the financial anomalies that are reflective of the situation.  Usually, the overnight Eurodollar trades very close to the overnight fed funds rate.  Both are overnight dollar loans between financial institutions on an unsecured basis.  Over the past month, the funds for overnight Eurodollars have frequently been trading much higher than overnight fed funds.  This highlights the difficulty that some European financial institutions are having borrowing in dollars and the unwillingness of many financial institutions to arbitrage these spreads if they involve credit exposures to European financial institutions, even for overnight.  These difficulties worsen when the maturities extend out to one to three months.  Both the one-month and three-month LIBOR rates have remained very elevated, particularly given that the fed funds futures during this period have indicated a market expectation of falling federal funds rates over the next three months.  The elevated LIBOR rate tightens credit for a variety of domestic borrowers and could affect areas that are already troubled.  For example, many subprime mortgages are tied to the LIBOR rate as are many loans that have been used to finance leveraged buyouts. A second example is the significant swelling of bank assets in August.  The monthly growth rate for bank C&I loans was 2.6 percent and for other loans and leases was 6.3 percent. These are among the largest monthly increases in thirty years.  As in other periods of liquidity strain, bank balance sheets become particularly important.  As banks honor loan commitments and agreements to provide liquidity support, their balance sheets grow.  My concern is that bank obligations will continue to expand bank balance sheets in September and crowd out other investment opportunities. Many financial market participants are very concerned about the next two weeks, despite some recent easing of conditions.  Some investors are not willing to lend except overnight.  The asset-backed commercial paper market has remained under stress, and the rollovers have been for shorter maturities.  There is significant concern that holders of commercial paper may be reluctant to hold asset-backed commercial paper on their balance sheets at the end of this month, and rumors abound about whether money market funds and other short-term investors will continue to hold commercial paper for structured products, particularly of the SIVs. So we have a situation of a very weak housing sector, some evidence of slowing employment growth, and a period of extended illiquidity that may get worse before it gets better. The tail risk of liquidity problems and economic problems has grown, and we clearly want to avoid outcomes by which declines in prices for houses and for financial assets tied to the housing sector could create more-severe economic outcomes.  The fact is that we do not have much experience with periods of extended illiquidity, especially when the housing sector is so weak. So taking out insurance against these risks seems entirely appropriate.  The decision is made easier, in my view, because I see the risk of unacceptably high inflation resulting from such an action as being quite low.  My hope is that with appropriate easing of policy the liquidity issues will abate as we start the fourth quarter."
"391";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me make a few comments about current economic conditions and then talk a bit about the outlook.  By way of overview, I will say that I largely agree with the Greenbook, both about the current quarter and about the near-term outlook, in any event.  The current quarter does look as though it is going to turn out to be certainly respectable real growth of 2½ percent or perhaps a bit more.  The anecdotes from our District that relate to the third quarter seem to be consistent with that.  Employment has been sustained, and if anything, the reports of the scarcity of skilled labor have probably increased.  In fact, some of our directors have speculated that perhaps the aggregate employment gains have been restrained by that availability issue.  The largest bank in our District and several others say that, based on what they are seeing, consumer spending and consumer unsecured borrowing are proceeding normally.  Repayments are proceeding normally, and credit quality on the consumer side is in good shape.  The one exception to what I would describe as a generally positive picture is what we are hearing in the nonresidential construction sector.  I don’t want to make too much of this, but I have a sense that it is significant.  Some of the large developers in the District have reported that, because of the change in financial conditions that has occurred in the past month or two, some projects are clearly being postponed.  Whether they will ultimately be cancelled remains to be seen, but there certainly have been some effects there. Turning to the outlook, I think that the outlook for real growth over the next several quarters is less favorable than it was formerly.  I admit that it’s a stretch to get there, if we rely on our familiar models to produce that result.  Nevertheless, I take a cue from the comments I made a moment ago about nonresidential construction.  It looks as though that will be somewhat slower than I earlier anticipated because of changing financial conditions.  I would guess that we would see the same thing in outlays for equipment and software, so I’m expecting a less favorable performance there.  As far as the housing sector is concerned, it seems to me that, given the inventory of unsold homes, even if financial conditions improve and improve relatively quickly, housing is going to exert a depressing effect on the economy for quite some time to come, just because of the inventory overhang.  More broadly, the changes in the cost and availability of credit that we see are likely to hamper the economic expansion for several quarters.  So I have marked down my forecast accordingly, based on changes in the factors I cited—namely, a somewhat less favorable outlook for nonresidential construction and ultimately for spending on equipment and software, prolonged weakness in the housing sector, and a somewhat less favorable outlook for consumer spending as a consequence of changes in credit cost and credit availability. On the inflation front, the incoming information is slightly more favorable than I had earlier expected, and so on margin I have adjusted my forecast there as well.  I had been expecting a diminution of core inflation as a consequence of the ebbing of transitory factors and of a moderately restrictive monetary policy.  It appears to me now that the decrease in underlying inflation is occurring a little sooner than I had anticipated, and I think this is obviously a positive development from a number of perspectives, one of which is that it is potentially significant as it gives us a little more maneuvering room on the policy front if, in fact, it is sustained.  Thank you."
"392";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As Governor Kohn just suggested, I think financial market tumult is likely to be of sufficient duration to have a meaningful effect on the real economy.  The policies that we’ll be considering later today are unlikely to be a panacea, but I think that is not a reason for us to avoid taking some smart and preemptive actions.  The recuperation of these financial market trends is positive, but I wouldn’t measure the recovery period here in weeks or even the next couple of months.  I suspect it is going to take longer. The moderate growth story that many of us have been telling and that is reflected in the Greenbook and has been for some time appears at best case to be even more moderate.  The downside risks and the possibility of some nonlinear events in these financial markets are higher, perhaps not as high as they might have seemed when we last met by videoconference, but those prospects are still very real.  When we had the videoconference on August 16, there appeared to be at that moment extremely poor market functioning, necessitating our actions that day.  I think we rightly determined that there was a liquidity shock, maybe even a liquidity crisis, that was affecting financial intermediaries and that our actions were necessary to stop the liquidity symptoms from manifesting themselves as a credit crisis.  To that end, our work goes on today. The results from that action and the benefit of time seem to have stopped the bleeding, and the deterioration of financial market conditions has largely ceased.  However, although the improvements at this point are quite encouraging, I don’t think they are yet convincing.  Let me just spend a few moments on the distinct phases of what this financial market distress has looked like and try to outline, maybe even oversimplify, where we are in that. Phase 1 strikes me as liquidity replenishment by financial institutions and marketmakers alike.  During the past three to four weeks, commercial banks, investment banks, asset managers, and other private pools of capital have had to reassess their liquidity needs, their cash needs, in light of the tougher financial market conditions.  Today, by and large, they have more cash on hand than they ever thought would be necessary or prudent.  But that liquidity replenishment, at least for the median and stronger firms, is somewhat complete as they evaluate what the risks are of contingent liabilities coming on their balance sheets and as they reevaluate the stress tests and the comments of the people and the risk managers who had been telling them that they were ripe for financial distress.  Some degree of confidence has been broken over the past six weeks.  I wouldn’t say it has been reestablished, but I think that is probably one of the things in the post Sarbanes-Oxley era that are giving the decisionmakers at these financial institutions a little less interest in diving back into these markets—they learned that maybe what they had at their disposal or what they thought they knew wasn’t as certain as they had hoped.  Many of these financial institutions during the past several weeks still thought that another leg down was possible—that strong financial institutions were continuing to ensure, and would continue to ensure even today, against four-sigma events—and that the best way for them to lose their jobs in this environment was to be short of liquidity.  They are also very focused on what is happening among their peers.  They are very focused on their relative strength, and they certainly want to be the survivors if the situation gets dramatically worse.  All of these are in some ways ex post rationalizations for why many of these institutions didn’t serve in the shock-absorber role that we would have expected them to take quickly after market distresses had begun.  I think they are getting used to the new environment.  They have long since forgotten the robust times and the robust profits of the past five years, and they are looking at their capital ratios and getting some comfort from what their people are telling them.  But when we look at these financial institutions, we are probably more prudent to judge them by their actions rather than what these capital ratios would suggest.  Their actions are still not ebullient.  Their actions are still not overly opportunistic. I said before that liquidity is confidence.  Well, in times like this, I might be wrong. Liquidity is oxygen.  They can’t live without it, and no price can compensate them during this liquidity replenishment period for a lack of oxygen.  I think O2 levels might now finally be returning, so that they can enter phase 2 of this process, when they are able and willing to part with their cash.  Phase 2, thus, is about finding new market-clearing valuations, being able to discriminate among differentiated assets, and being able to put opportunistic capital to work. Admittedly, I’d say this valuation phase is less advanced than the liquidity phase, but the process of price discovery is slowly but surely working its way through these asset classes.  High-yield bonds are one example.  Chrysler priced high-yield bonds at 95.  A couple of days later they were trading at 99.  Other sorts of leveraged loans and high-yield financing have indicative prices in the mid-90s, but there are very big pipelines, as we have discussed before, that could take a while to clear.  My best guess is that we won’t see those markets clearing until after the commercial banks announce their third-quarter results.  So in mid-October, we might see a new estimate of that, but I will admit it’s very hard to say.  The price-discovery process around subprime mortgages is less advanced, but even there we are seeing trading desks asking the executives on the top floor for balance sheet capital because they see great prices for which they just need the balance sheet.  That those discussions have begun and are somewhat more advanced than when we last talked is an encouraging sign, but the process of adjustment to the new market realities will take time.  Bill Dudley spoke in great detail about other important developments—discrimination among asset-backed commercial paper programs being made depending on sponsor and collateral, financial institutions and the counterparty risk they represent being differentiated, and commercial banks more so today than even some weeks ago willing to invest in jumbo prime mortgages in the expectation that the securitization markets will reopen. It strikes me that we are substantially advanced in the liquidity phase and only somewhat advanced in valuation.  That would take us to the third phase.  The third phase is about the cost of capital.  We’ll talk about it more in the next round, and optimally I would say that the liquidity replenishment and valuation necessary would be far more advanced before monetary policy actions would have to be put into place.  But I think we bought ourselves some time, and this strikes me as the right moment for us to take monetary policy actions.  The good news is that we have seen some tentative progress in those first two phases, and we’ll talk more about our actions to come. Let me just highlight a few more issues.  What are the key challenges?  What are the things to which we might want to look to see if the situation continues to improve modestly or reverses itself?  I would look at a few things.  First, as you look at some of these SIV structures and conduits, particularly outside the mortgage assets, to this point they are largely suffering from a liquidity crisis rather than a credit crisis.  That could change if the real economy falters, and that is an additional reason for us to take monetary action today.  Second, many still believe that it’s not safe to come out and play, and they are continuing to hunker down.  I would have thought, right when this started brewing in the middle of August, that by now folks would have been more comfortable, but the median person is still more scared than I would have expected. Third, leverage is harder to come by.  Even on investments for which the credit work seems pretty easy, like high yield, it is hard to get leverage alongside these equity placements, making folks less interested to jump back in a big way because the returns aren’t there.  Another indicator I’d look to is the medium-term note market, which we haven’t discussed a great deal but is really a sibling of some of these other commercial paper markets.  They don’t appear to be too distressed at this time, but as mentioned earlier, I would also look at the mortgage-backed securities around commercial real estate.  The lack of term funding, which we’ll discuss when we discuss the auction term facility, has put financial market improvements at some risk.  Even though we have been seeing real improvements in recent trading days, the prospect that these institutions are rolling over their funding and looking for funding every day strikes me as significantly increasing the tail risk and suggests that we need to take action. Finally, on the real economy, having spoken to a range of credit card companies yesterday to try to get their sense of three things, I can give I think generally positive reports. First, as a measure of retail sales, the view of institutions that cater to the high end, the middle end, and the low end is that retail sales in August and through the first two weeks of September were fine, not great.  But when I asked them the question “If you weren’t aware of what was happening in the financial markets and you were just to review these data, does it look as though something happened?  Does it look as though there was some exogenous shock?” to a person the answer was, “No, it looks as though things are coming along okay.”  I think that’s reasonably encouraging.  Second, I asked them about the credit quality of consumer behavior, whether delinquencies for individual credit card behavior at the low, medium, or high end had changed, and the answer was that they really hadn’t changed much.  They can look and find yellow or red flags, but they said generally that consumer credit quality also looks fine.  I’d say the biggest caution from three or four of these credit card companies came on the corporate side. Corporations wanting to be more protective, being more risk averse during this period, seemed to have cut back on allowable expenses for things like airlines, hotels, conferences, and the like, so their corporate credit volume had slowed up somewhat—but, again, nothing overly dramatic. Last, I would just share the uncertainty and hesitation that has probably crept its way back into boardrooms generally as many of these companies outside the financial sector are trying to figure out what the crystal ball looks like for the real economy.  That hesitation is not useful, and as I said at the outset, I think the best case is that we give up a couple of tenths of GDP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"393";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports that I am hearing from my business contacts reflect a sudden and a significant deterioration in their evaluation of the business climate.  The data in hand, except for the troubling August employment report, have not been especially dire, and neither are the impressions I get from the business community regarding their current pace of economic activity.  In fact, by most accounts, business activity in the Fourth District, outside of the residential real estate market, remains reasonably positive, and the Beige Book report that we submitted for this meeting reflects that view.  In most cases, the sharp downward reassessment of the business situation that I am now hearing from my contacts describes greater unease over what may happen and not what has happened.  As we discussed earlier, our forecast models are not well equipped to accommodate the role that shifting expectations play in shaping the economic outlook.  Nevertheless, the sharp falloff in business confidence that I am hearing from people in many sectors in the District has had a material influence on the economic projections that I submitted for this meeting. The market for real estate is still declining, perhaps even in a freefall, according to the descriptions I have been getting from people across the sector, including real estate professionals, developers, and manufacturers of home construction supplies and materials.  I don’t pretend to have a very confident forecast of where the bottom of the residential real estate market lies, but the industry sources that I am talking to have convinced me that we should anticipate that this process will play itself out for a considerable time to come.  Moreover, and unlike my last report to the Committee, my business contacts are now fearful that we are going to see a spillover from the declines in the residential real estate market, and they now expect some amount of retrenchment by consumers.  I have incorporated some of that sentiment into my outlook.  The most noteworthy development affecting my economic projection, however, has been the deterioration in business confidence and the effect that deterioration may have on capital expansion plans.  The diminished confidence in the outlook that business leaders are reporting to me has had a significant negative effect on my outlook for investment.  Like the Greenbook, I have scaled back my growth outlook to reflect a considerably softer trajectory for business fixed investment.  Even with a monetary policy response, the combination of weaker consumer and business spending has led me to mark down my GDP projection for next year nearly ½ percentage point, to 2 percent. Meanwhile, the incoming inflation report continues to point to a gradual disinflation. The usual caveats about inflation forecasts apply, of course, but I am not seeing in the data—and I am not hearing from my business contacts—the same concern over rising prices that I heard in the spring.  My outlook for inflation hasn’t changed that much since July.  I am still expecting core PCE inflation to be just under 2 percent.  But I am more confident, if just a little, that we are seeing the progress toward price stability that we had hoped to achieve. So I believe that the risks to the outlook, given no change in our policy, have shifted decisively toward potential rapid deterioration in the real economy.  Some of that deterioration may reflect the unwinding of earlier financial imbalances, and every prudent effort should be made to allow that process to run its course.  But the moral hazard caveat does not diminish the significance of the falloff in business sentiment that I have heard since our last meeting, and so I am concerned that we have seen greater risk to the economic outlook since our last meeting. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"394";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Readings on core inflation during the intermeeting period have continued to be encouraging, and the downward trend has persisted long enough that I’ve lowered my inflation forecast slightly.  With the weaker outlook for growth, I also see less upside inflation risk emanating from cyclical pressures.  With respect to economic activity, I’ve downgraded my forecast for growth in the fourth quarter by about the same amount as Greenbook and lowered it only marginally, a bit less than Greenbook, in 2008.  The downside risks to this forecast are substantial and worrisome.  The downward revision to my forecast reflects three factors:  first, incoming data bearing on the outlook; second, my assessment of the likely impact of the financial shock that’s been unfolding since mid-July; third, the offsetting effect of the policy changes I consider appropriate in response to the first two forces.  My forecast assumes that the fed funds rate will fall to about 4½ percent in the fourth quarter.  In other words, my forecast is premised on timely actions by the Committee to mitigate much of the potential damage. Let me begin by commenting on the economic data that we have received since early August.  Some has certainly been positive.  Growth in the second quarter was revised upward, suggesting more momentum heading into the current quarter, and most indicators of consumer spending and business fixed investment were also robust.  Like most observers, I’ve concluded that these data taken together support a small upward revision in my estimate of third-quarter growth. However, recent data on housing and forward-looking indicators relating to this sector suggest even greater weakness in residential investment than we previously anticipated.  Manufacturing activity recently turned down, and importantly to me, the August employment report showed a marked deceleration in payroll employment growth over the past three months, suggesting that the financial shock hit an economy possessing quite a bit less momentum than I had factored into my previous forecast.  Moreover, survey measures of consumer confidence are down, and these results probably do incorporate early effects from the recent financial shock. Of course, the most important factor shaping the forecast for the fourth quarter and beyond is the earthquake that began roiling financial markets in mid-July.  Our contacts located at the epicenter—those, for example, in the private equity and mortgage markets—report utter devastation.  Anecdotal reports from those nearby—for example, our contacts in banking, housing construction, and housing-related businesses—suggest significant damage from the temblor.  For example, a large furniture retailer with stores in Utah and Nevada has seen sales fall off, and he has tightened credit terms for his customers and has already frozen his hiring and investment plans.  In contrast, our business contacts operating further from the epicenter appear remarkably unfazed. Luckily for them and for us, the financial quake has thus far produced at most minor tremors in their businesses.  This is not surprising.  It is still too early to expect the ripple effects to be noticed by our contacts or to show up in the spending data. We could take a wait-and-see approach to the financial shock, incorporating its impact on our growth forecasts only after we observe its imprint in the spending data.  But such an approach would be misguided and fraught with hazard because it would deprive us of the opportunity to act in time to forestall the likely damage.  This means we must do our best to assess the likely effect of the shock.  The simplest approach is to rely on our usual forecasting models.  However, as David emphasized in his remarks, the shock has not affected to any great extent the financial variables that are typically included in our macro models.  Since we last met, there have been only small net changes in broad equity indexes and the dollar.  Of course, risk spreads in credit markets are up across a broad range of instruments and for most borrowers, both corporate and households.  But there has been an offsetting drop in Treasury rates so that key rates appearing in our models—the interest rate on conforming mortgages and the interest rate facing prime corporate borrowers—are little changed or even slightly lower.  It is riskier corporate borrowers and households seeking nonconforming mortgage loans, including jumbos, that have seen their borrowing rates rise over the past few months.  But importantly, it is the drop in Treasury yields, about 50 to 100 basis points since early July, that has thus far shielded so many borrowers from higher interest rates, and of course, this drop reflects the market’s expectations that the Committee will ease the stance of monetary policy rather substantially.  As I noted, my forecast assumes that we will plan to ease by around 75 basis points by year-end in line with market expectations.  Even under this assumption, I see movements in interest rates alone as adding to a modest tightening of financial conditions. But, of course, an evaluation of the likely economic impact from the financial shock must also take into account changes in credit availability and lending terms even though these variables rarely appear explicitly in forecasting models.  It is apparent that the availability of lending of some types, including subprime and alt-A mortgages, has diminished substantially or disappeared entirely.  Moreover, banks and other financial institutions are imposing tighter terms and conditions across a broad range of corporate and household lending programs.  For example, FICO cutoffs have been raised and maximum loan-to-value ratios lowered in many mortgage programs according to our contacts.  In part, these changes reflect the pressures that banks and other financial intermediaries are experiencing in the context of severe illiquidity in secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages and other asset-backed securities, asset-backed commercial paper, and term loans in the interbank market. Many of the liquidity problems now afflicting banks and other financial market participants will presumably be resolved at least eventually, but it’s hard to believe that markets will return to business as usual as defined by conditions in the first half of this year even after that occurs.  For one thing, many of the structured credit products that became so widely used may prove to be too complex to be viable going forward, and this would more or less permanently reduce the quantity of credit available to many risky borrowers.  Moreover, if the financial intermediation that was routinely conducted via asset securitization and off-balance-sheet financing vehicles ultimately migrates back onto the books of the banks, borrowing spreads and lending terms are likely to remain tighter given current limitations on bank capital and the higher costs of conducting intermediation through the banking sector.  Most important, the recent widening of spreads appears to reflect a return to more-realistic pricing of risk throughout the economy; this development may be positive for the long run, but it will be contractionary in the short run. Similar to the Greenbook, we’ve incorporated these financial developments into our projection by revising down our forecast for residential construction and home prices.  But as we all know, housing is a small sector, so a major question is to what extent the financial shock will spread to other parts of the economy.  We see a large drop in house prices as quite likely to adversely affect consumption spending over time through a number of different channels, including wealth effects, collateral effects, and negative effects on spending through the interest rate resets.  A big worry is that a significant drop in house prices might occur in the context of job losses, and this could lead to a vicious spiral of foreclosures, further weakness in housing markets, and further reductions in consumer spending.  Several alternative simulations in the Greenbook illustrate some of the unpleasant scenarios that could develop.  A final concern is that the uncertainty associated with turbulent financial markets could make households and businesses more cautious about spending, causing some investment plans to be put on hold and some planned purchases of houses and consumer durables to be deferred.  So at this point I am concerned that the potential effects of the developing credit crunch could be substantial.  I recognize that there’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty around any estimate.  But I see the skew in the distribution to be primarily to the downside, reflecting possible adverse spillovers from housing to consumption and business investment."
"395";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20070918meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, the balance of risks has changed significantly over the past several weeks.  Although outside of housing we don’t see much evidence nationally of a significant softening of growth, growth is likely to be somewhat softer than we had expected, and the downside risks to that lower path have increased substantially.  I think inflation risks have diminished somewhat, but we have to remain attentive to the familiar sources of continued upward pressure.  Financial conditions have tightened since the August meeting, even with the increase in the amount of easing priced into markets, and despite the moderation in the LIBOR term spread to fed funds over the past few days, conditions in credit and funding markets remain very fragile.  Even under relatively optimistic assumptions about how these developments in markets will unfold, the process of adjustment will take some time to work through the financial system, and very protracted impairment to market functioning would raise, of course, the possibility of even more-adverse outcomes on the real side of the economy. These changes, in my view, justify a reduction in the fed funds rate at this meeting. Monetary policy has an important role to play in reducing the width of the adverse tail of the range of potential outcomes for real activity.  By reducing the probability of an extremely bad outcome on the real side, monetary policy can help mitigate some of the coordination problems that are hampering financial market functioning and delaying the necessary repricing of risk that needs to take place, particularly in markets for term funding, the interbank market, and for mortgage-related products.  The difficult and consequential judgment we face is about the appropriate size of the monetary policy response to these changes in risks to the outlook.  I believe the arguments work in favor of doing more now rather than less.  Policy needs to provide a convincing degree of insurance against a more adverse outcome. Of course, there are risks of erring on the side of doing too much now, and let me just address three of those risks.  First, a large move could add to concerns about the downside risks to growth and about financial fragility rather than mitigating those concerns.  My view, however, is that doing too little now would risk exacerbating uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook, and a gradualist, tentative response would be more disconcerting than encouraging.  The risk of underdoing it now is that we will ultimately be forced to do more.  A second risk is that a large move now could add to uncertainty about future inflation outcomes.  This is true. However, I think various measures of changes to the inflation outlook suggest that risks to inflation have moderated a bit, and the markets are displaying a fair amount of confidence in both our will and our ability to keep future inflation stable at reasonably low levels.  Acting in a way that suggests that we believe our credibility is more fragile would be more disconcerting than encouraging to the markets.  The third risk is that a large move could reinforce concerns that we are adding to the moral hazard in the financial system.  This is, I think, an inevitable, necessary consequence of acting to provide insurance against an extremely negative outcome, but it’s not a good argument against doing what we think is justified by the balance of risks to the outlook.  In this context, it is important to be careful in the way we talk publicly about moral hazard regarding this balance.  In our financial system there is a substantial amount of leverage in institutions and vehicles that are subject to very acute liquidity risk, and part of what you are now seeing in Europe, in the United Kingdom in particular, are the effects on confidence of finding the wrong balance, frankly, between concerns about moral hazard and the appropriate role of the central bank in situations like this.  I think the framework that the Chairman laid out in Jackson Hole explains exactly the right balance between what we cannot or should not try to do and what is important to do with monetary policy. The process of adjustment and deleveraging that is under way in markets, in asset prices and risk premiums, is necessary, and we should not direct policy at interrupting or arresting that process or at insulating investors or institutions from the consequences of the decisions that got us to this point.  Our objective should be to help facilitate that process but to do so in a way that reduces the chance that it will cause too much damage to the functioning of the core of the financial system and to confidence, because of the consequence of such a scenario for the real economy.  To get through this process, bank balance sheets need to expand substantially, and we’re fortunate that they can expand and are now expanding very substantially.  A range of nonbank financial institutions and financing vehicles will have to be unwound and restructured. Asset prices and risk premiums may have to move further as more deleveraging takes place and assets are liquidated.  Some of the inevitable increase in macroeconomic uncertainty is priced into expectations.  Investors will have to get more comfortable that they can make judgments about how to value mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, despite the loss of faith in ratings.  The process of differentiation among strong and weak institutions, conduits, financing vehicles, et cetera, also has to continue.  But as many of you said, this process could take quite some time, and it will leave us with the risk of a fair amount of fragility in markets in the interim. Let me end just by reminding you of what I’ll call the “Bernanke Doctrine of Credibility” that the Chairman laid out at one of our previous meetings.  Credibility for a central banker is not just about the confidence that we instill in markets that we will act to keep inflation stable and low.  It is also a function of our capacity to demonstrate that we have a sufficient feel for the evolution of the economy and about confidence and that we will meet those inflation objectives without excessive cost to real activity and confidence.  Part of that credibility is a feel for what is happening in markets and a capacity to look forward and anticipate the potential implications that those developments may have for the outlook.  Thank you."

Let me try to summarize this discussion.  It is a little harder than usual.  Broadly, the macroeconomic news came in slightly better than expected during the intermeeting period.  Housing has been very weak, as expected; but consumption, investment, and net exports were relatively strong in recent months. In the aggregate data, there is yet no clear sign of a spillover from housing.  Most participants expect several weak quarters followed by recovery later next year. The risks remain to the downside but may be less than at our last meeting.  One issue, given all these factors, is determining the equilibrium short-term interest rate.  Financial market conditions have improved somewhat since our last meeting, with investors discriminating among borrowers and with the process of price discovery proceeding.  There was general agreement that conditions are not back to normal and that it would be some time before that happened.  Some suggested that a risk of relapse remains, should credit quality worsen or further bad news be disclosed.  Lending conditions have tightened, particularly for mortgages, and securitization remains impaired.  There is not yet much evidence that this tightening is affecting business borrowing, however, although financial conditions may have somewhat increased uncertainty among business leaders. Views on how consumption would evolve were mixed.  Consumer sentiment is on the weak side, house prices are down, and oil prices are up, which suggests some weakening ahead. However, the labor market remains reasonably solid, which should support consumer spending. Anecdotal information about consumer spending was unusually mixed.  Some saw evidence of growing weakness in consumption.  This evidence included weak reports from shippers and credit card companies.  Others saw the consumer side as slowing a bit but generally healthy. Investment, including investment in commercial real estate, may also be slowing somewhat; but again, the evidence is mixed.  Manufacturing growth appears to be moderating.  Other sectors— including energy, agriculture, high-tech, and tourism—are doing well.  Core inflation has moderated, and there was generally more comfort that this improvement would persist.  There was less concern expressed about tightness in labor markets and wage pressures.  Energy prices and food prices could lead total inflation to rise, perhaps even into next year, and there is the risk of pass-through to the core.  Similar concerns apply to the dollar and to export prices.  Some, but not all, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations have risen, and survey-based measures have been stable.  Most participants saw inflation risks to the upside, but at least some saw them as less pressing than earlier this year.  That is my summary.  Comments? Well, again, as usual, it is hard to be the last person to speak, but let me make just a few comments.  First, as always, the Greenbook was very thoughtful.  The authors have done a good job of balancing the risks, and I find their forecast very plausible as a modal forecast.  Housing does seem to be very weak, of course, and manufacturing looks to be slowing further.  But except for those sectors, there is a good bit of momentum still in the economy.  Having said that, I think there is an unusual amount of uncertainty around the modal forecast, maybe less than in September but still a great deal. Let me talk briefly about three areas:  financial markets, housing, and inflation.  A lot of people have already spoken about financial markets.  Market functioning certainly has improved. Our action in September helped on that.  For example, commercial paper markets are working almost normally for good borrowers, the spreads are down, and volumes are stable.  One concern that we had for quite a while was that banks would be facing binding balance sheet constraints because of all the contingent liabilities that they had—off-balance-sheet vehicles, leveraged loans, and so on.  That problem seems to be somewhat less than it was.  Some of the leveraged loans are being sold off, some of the worst off-balance-sheet vehicles are being wound down.  So there is generally improvement in the financial market, certainly.  In the past couple of weeks there has been some deterioration in sentiment, and I see that as coming from essentially two factors.  First, there were a number of reports of unusually large and unanticipated losses, which reduced the confidence of investors that we had detected and unearthed all the bad news.  This problem will eventually be resolved, but clearly we still have some way to go to clarify where people stand.  The other issue, which I think is more pertinent to our discussion, is about economic fundamentals.  There was a very bad response, for example, to Caterpillar’s profit report, and so the market is appropriately responding to economic fundamentals as they feed through into credit concerns. From our perspective, one of the key issues will be the availability of credit to consumers and firms going forward.  My sense—based on my talking to supervisors, looking at the senior loan officer survey, and talking to some people in the markets—is that banks are becoming quite conservative, and that is what Kevin said.  It is not necessarily a balance sheet constraint but more a concern about renewed weakness in markets.  It is also a concern about the condition of borrowers, about credit risk, and the demands of investors for very tight underwriting.  Now, of course, tight underwriting is not a bad thing; it is a good thing.  But from our perspective, we need to think about its potential implications for growth and, if you like, for r*.  The biggest effect of the tighter underwriting, of course, has been on mortgage loans, although we have seen a bit of improvement in the secondary market for prime jumbos, which is encouraging if that continues.  This is the area in which vicious-circle effects, which Vice Chairman Geithner and others have talked about, is most concerning.  House prices, according to the Greenbook, are projected to fall 4½ percent over the next two years.  Clearly, there is some downside risk to that. If house prices were to fall much more, that would feed into credit evaluations, into balance sheets, back into credit extension, and so on.  So I think there is a risk there, as Governor Kroszner and Governor Mishkin also discussed.  The corporate sector is not much of a problem. Good firms are issuing debt without much problem.  I don’t really have much read on small business, but I have not heard much complaining in that area either.  With respect to consumers, my guess is that we are going to see some effects on consumers.  Certainly, home equity loans and installment loans have tightened up.  We can see that in the senior loan officer survey.  We don’t see that yet for credit cards, but since a lot of credit cards are used by people with subprime credit histories, I suspect that we will see some tightening there.  So I do expect to see some effect on consumers from credit conditions. As has already been mentioned, an area we also need to note is commercial real estate. Financing conditions have already tightened there quite considerably, and spreads are much wider.  The senior loan officer survey shows the tightening of terms and conditions that matches previous recessions, and CMBS issuance has dropped very significantly.  You can debate whether or not this tightening is justified by fundamentals.  On the one hand, vacancy rates remain low, and rents are high.  On the other hand, it is still also true that price-to-rent ratios are quite high.  If you calculate an equity risk premium for commercial real estate analogously to the way you calculate one for stocks, you would find that it is at an unusually low level, which would tend to suggest that prices may fall.  So it is uncertain, I would say.  Certainly one area in which we might see further retrenchment in commercial real estate is the public sector:  Tax receipts are slowing, and that might affect building decisions.  So I do think this is another area in which we will be seeing some effects from credit tightening.  I should be clear—the Greenbook already incorporates a considerable slowdown in commercial real estate, but that means it will no longer offset the residential slowdown. I just want to make one comment about housing, which I think we all agree is a central source of uncertainty, both for the credit reasons I have discussed and in terms of prices, wealth, and other issues.  Let me just make one point that I found striking anyway, which is that—at least from the Greenbook—the forecast of a strengthening economy by next spring and the second half of next year is very closely tied to the assumption that housing will turn around next spring.  In particular, if you look at all the final demand components for the economy, other than housing, in 2007 those components contributed 3.5 percentage points to GDP.  According to the Greenbook forecast, in 2008 all those components together will contribute 2.0 percentage points to GDP.  So the fact that GDP doesn’t slow any more than 0.6 comes from the assumption that the negative contribution of housing next year will be much less than it was in this year.  It is certainly possible—again, I think the Greenbook authors have done a good job of balancing the risks.  But as we have noted, we have missed this turn before, and it could happen again.  So let me just note that as an important issue.  If we do miss on that turn, the other forecast errors for consumption and so on obviously would be correlated with that miss. Finally, let me talk for a moment about inflation.  I want to share the concerns that some people have noted.  If you wanted to be defensive about inflation, you could point out that the movement in oil prices and the dollar and so on is in part due to our actions.  But it is also due to a lot of other things—for example, the dollar in broad real terms is about where it was in the late ’90s.  In that respect, it is perhaps about where it should be in terms of trying to make progress on the current account deficit.  Similarly, with oil, a lot of other factors besides monetary policy are involved.  That said, I share with Governor Warsh the concern that the visibility of these indicators day after day in financial markets and on television screens has a risk of affecting inflation psychology.  I do worry about that.  I think we should pay attention to that.  So I do think that is a concern, and we obviously need to take it into consideration in our policies, in our statements, and in our public remarks. I have one more comment on housing before ending.  In thinking about the turnaround for housing next year, Governor Kroszner talked about resets and those sorts of issues.  We spend a lot of time here at the Board thinking about different plans for refinancing subprime borrowers or other borrowers into sustainable mortgages.  We have looked at the FHA and other types of approaches.  A very interesting paper by an economist named Joseph Mason at Drexel discusses, at a very detailed institutional level, the issues related to refinancing, in terms both of the servicers’ incentives and of the regulatory perspective.  Mason points out that there are some serious regulatory problems with the massive refinancing effort, including consumer protection issues, because refinancing can be a source of scams.  There are also issues of safety and soundness because refinancing can be a way to disguise losses, for example.  If you read that paper, I think you will be persuaded—at least I am becoming increasingly persuaded—that a significant amount of refinancing will not be happening and that we will see substantial financial problems and foreclosures that will peak somewhere in the middle of next year.  So I think that is an additional risk that we ought to take into account as we think about the evolution of housing. Those are just a few comments on the general outlook.  Let me just note, we will adjourn in a moment.  There will be a reception and a dinner, for those of you who wish to stay.  There will be no program or business, so if you have other plans, feel free to pursue them.  A number of pieces of data, including GDP, will arrive overnight, and we will begin tomorrow morning with a discussion of the new data.  Perhaps that will help us in our discussion of policy.  Thank you.  The meeting is adjourned. [Meeting recessed] October 31, 2007—Morning Session"
"397";"MR. EVANS.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Seventh District economy appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, similar to what I reported at our last meeting.  As we talked with business contacts, we heard mixed reviews regarding activity across different sectors of the economy.  On the downside, everyone in the construction industry, from builders to suppliers, had grim assessments, and our contacts with the Detroit Three characterize the vehicle market as mediocre.  Another negative is on the labor front.  Our contact at Manpower reported that demand for temporary workers was down a lot.  He said that the current market felt almost as it did in 2001. Kelly’s assessment was not quite so negative, although they did say that some indicators were flashing yellow.  Of course, the BLS has been showing declines in temp help employment since early 2006, and most other indicators point to a healthy labor market.  Indeed, we continue to hear about firms trying to cope with shortages of skilled workers.  For instance, a couple of heavy- equipment manufacturers based in Illinois said that they were recruiting engineers from the Detroit area.  That was encouraging.  There were other upbeat reports on activity.  United Airlines said that all their markets were quite good, apparently better than President Fisher was reporting earlier. They noted the bookings for business travel, which can be an indicator of business’s more general willingness to spend, remained strong in October and November.  International bookings also were extremely good.  We heard numerous reports of strong export demand—for example, for machine tool manufacturers and heavy-equipment producers.  With regard to the financial situation, I continue to hear that there is a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street.  Importantly, except for construction, our contacts do not see nonfinancial firms being constrained by a lack of access to credit or by the pricing of credit. Turning to the macroeconomy, the news on economic activity that we’ve received over the past six weeks has been better than the downside scenario that we feared.  Indeed, it has been better than what we had assumed in our baseline forecast in September.  Like the Greenbook, we have raised our outlook for growth in the second half of 2007 about ½ percentage point.  Residential investment does look a bit worse than we thought, but consumption came in a good deal stronger than we had expected.  Also, the incoming news about labor markets, including the revisions to employment in August, points to continued support to household spending from growth in jobs and income.  Unlike the Greenbook, we marked up the outlook for activity a bit in 2008 and 2009.  Our current projection sees growth recovering to a little above potential in the second half of next year and in 2009. With regard to inflation, the incoming price data have been positive, and we have revised down our forecast for inflation a bit, to about 1¾ percent in 2008 and 2009.  I think the risks to this forecast are two-sided.  Some of our statistical models translate the incoming data into quite low forecasts for inflation in 2009 and 2010 if you take them at face value.  But higher costs for energy and other materials, the weaker dollar, and potential pressures from resource utilization still pose some risk that inflation will come in higher than we currently are forecasting.  For me, the positive inflation developments are an important ingredient allowing us to focus on risk management.  Since risk-management considerations have played a key role in our policy decisions, it is important to think about how the risks to the forecast have changed since September.  Last time and today, Dave Stockton cited several downside risks to watch for:  an intensified fallout from the problems in mortgage finance onto housing demand; a substantial drop in consumer sentiment; and a spillover from financial market disruptions to business spending.  These high-cost scenarios are possible, but I think their likelihood is smaller than they were in September.  We have been pessimistic on housing for a while, and for once, despite Dave Stockton’s warning, I am encouraged that the Greenbook’s forecast for 2008 has not been marked down materially.  It is a small comfort, but just a bit.  The economy outside of housing seems to have entered the fourth quarter with more momentum than we had thought it would.  Importantly, consumption growth has been solid even though there has been another downtick in sentiment. On the financial front, the Greenbook points to the special Beige Book capital spending questions and to the senior loan officer survey as signals that we could expect more spillovers to nonfinancial activity.  Tighter standards for C&I loans are definitely news, but they are hardly surprising.  The real news will be next quarter.  Looking at previous surveys, we had one bad quarter in 1998, and then it came down, and then the later tightening was part of the increase in the fed funds rate.  So I think that the next quarter will be very informative and important.  In assessing how risks have changed, these surveys need to be balanced against the improvements we have seen in credit markets.  While I continue to be concerned about collateral damage from the credit markets to real activity, I still think the problems in financial markets are likely to remain largely walled off from the nonfinancial economy.  So on balance, the economic outlook has improved, and the risks of financial contagion have diminished somewhat since September, although they haven’t disappeared.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"398";"MR. FISHER.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the global economy, the Eleventh District is slowing, but relative to the other Districts it remains very strong.  Our retail sales improved in September.  Nonresidential and commercial construction remains elevated.  Service- sector job growth strengthened significantly in September, and our staff estimates that 18.2 percent of the jobs created in the country year to date were created in the State of Texas.  I just wanted to mention that.  [Laughter]  Needless to say, wages are rising because of labor shortages, a decline in immigration, and the increase in minimum wage.  I will stop with the Texas brag and now go on to the national economy. I think President Rosengren just gave an excellent summary of the financial markets.  I would add only the following—that with regard to credit markets, the hardening of the arteries or the blockage of the aorta or whatever cardiovascular analogy we want to choose to describe what happened is no longer as severe and life-threatening as it appeared to be in August.  As mentioned by the staff, whether it is net bond issuance of investment-grade securities or C&I loans et cetera, the markets are moving toward pricing assets according to what they will sell for rather than what their hypothetical mathematical modeling value might posit.  There was a startling statement in the Financial Times on Friday morning.  Somebody, otherwise forgettable, said, “Corporate treasurers are no longer buying things they don’t understand.”  [Laughter] Imagine that.  Investors are coming home from lala land.  To be sure, we’re not out of the woods quite yet, as President Plosser and President Rosengren mentioned.  The situation remains real, but we’ve gone beyond suspended reality.  If you will forgive me, you might say we have gone from the ridiculous to the subprime.,   By that I mean, by the way, that the subprime market is a focus of angst, which it should be, but the ridiculous practice of the suspension of reason in valuing all asset classes, if not over, is in remission.  We have a long way to go before full recovery and must acknowledge that shocks regarding access might occur.  I am confident, as I have said in previous meetings, that—just to be polite—some cow patties might show up in the punchbowls of some portfolios, perhaps especially in Europe and Asia.  But I would submit, Mr. Chairman, that we are on our way back to markets priced by reason rather than by fantasy.  So, while we must remain ready to act as needed, I think it is appropriate to focus our discussion today and tomorrow foursquare on the economy, and I want to turn to that now. The wealth effect of the severe markdown in housing is as yet incalculable and worrisome.  As the Greenbook states and my sounding with CEOs confirms, there are as yet no appreciable, let alone debilitating, signs of spillover into the rest of the economy.  The economy has been weakened.  You see it in the rails and trucking and retail.  It has not shown signs of succumbing as much as one might have expected to the full-blown virus that is afflicting housing.  As Dave mentioned, going back to July, banks in our District and everywhere else have reported tightening terms and standards on loans to businesses and households.  The overall sentiment or mood of the country, as reported by the press and the surveys, is sour.  Yet we haven’t seen sharp increases in initial claims, low PMI (purchasing managers index) readings, or sharply falling durable goods orders.  Households are still reasonably optimistic about their job prospects.  Consumer spending continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace.  The CEO of Disney started his discussion with me this time by saying, “I hate to be the bearer of good news,” and went on to cite an internal survey they recently completed that shows that families plan to spend liberally on vacations, despite setbacks in presumed housing prices, as well as strong ad statistics for their broadcasting network. There remain widespread reports of labor shortages, not just in our District but also elsewhere.  The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that, there is clearly a fat left tail on growth—the economy is growing slower.  But the economy is growing at a positive pace.  Some might say that it has slowed to a sustainable pace.  In part, this is due to infrastructure investment, spending on nondefense capital goods that is better than expected, decent if not robust E&S demand, fiscal stimulus, and strong export performance that we talked about earlier, assisted by superior demand growth abroad, facilitated by a progressively weaker dollar.  I note that we meet the day after the trade-weighted dollar celebrated a post–Bretton Woods low—not an easy thing for a strong dollar man to note. Certainly, there is a risk that downward economic momentum will emerge.  I worry about the plight of the big, populous states like Florida and California under the crush of the housing implosion.  I take note of the reports from UPS, the rails, and the truckers as to the deceleration in year-over-year trends in pre-holiday shipments.  I realize that Wal-Mart same-store growth has slowed, that mall traffic is down, and so on.  But not a single one of my thirty-five CEO interlocutors, except for the homebuilders, felt that the economy was at risk of falling off the table.  Fluor and the other big builders—or logistics organizers, as I like to call them—report a booming domestic infrastructure business, especially in the petrochemical sector.  The technology folks, as manifested by the earnings reports of Microsoft, Apple, and others, continue to find that demand is brisk.  Cisco’s CEO confirms that business with all but the financial institutions “has begun to flow again” after being laid low by the uncertainty of August.  The airlines report volume conditions as “less bad” than they were in the third quarter.  UPS’s CFO, about to become CEO, who serves on President Lockhart’s board, is concerned, like the rails, about consumer holiday demand, and notes that trans-Pacific shipments into the United States have slowed.  Yet when he digs deep into the data, he will tell you that the tech side looks good. So the net effect is that, while nowhere near robust, “domestically, conditions have not materially worsened.” Except for housing and Bill’s two law firms, we are not hearing of significant lagging of receivables or collectibles.  Many of my interlocutors, however, worry about prices, as do our staff members in Dallas.  We differ significantly, Mr. Chairman, from the central assumption of the Greenbook in our views on headline inflation looking forward.  I noticed you cocking an eye in my direction, Brian, when you were talking about the outliers.  The Greenbook has a 3 percent number for PCE inflation for this year, followed by a deceleration, to a pace of 1.8 percent in 2008 and 1.7 in 2009.  We in Dallas are not as confident that we will continue to experience a disinflation of the momentum of the PCE.  Partly this stems from concerns expressed anecdotally by big importers like Wal-Mart, who report stiffening Chinese prices, by the CEO of JCPenney, who is planning for cost increases of goods imported from China on the order of 3 to 4 percent next year, and by the users of pulp and recycled waste paper that are set to announce a 5 percent increase in essential paper products effective in February, having just announced a double-digit increase not too long ago. Our concern at the Dallas Fed stems from two more-pervasive sources than that anecdotal evidence I just cited, and those are food and energy, for which we anticipate a more pernicious pass-through effect from recent rapid price increases of underlying commodities.  The concern we have for food is encapsulated in the eye-popping chart on page II-30 of Part 2 of the Greenbook.  You have to have a hawk’s eye to see this chart from that end of the table, but it shows an incredible divergence between food prices and the core PCE.  Now this pattern has a historical precedent.  A spread of this magnitude between food prices and core indexes occurred on several occasions between 1951 and 1980.  In 1973, the gap was 20 percent.  In 1974, the gap was closed when the CPI rose up accordingly.  But we have not seen a gap of this nature in over a quarter-century.  Wholesale food prices are up 6.3 percent for the year to date.  Through September, the CPI for food is up 5.7 percent.  As mentioned by one of the previous interlocutors, milk and green grocery prices are rising at double-digit paces.  This goes beyond ethanol, Mr. Chairman, as a driver of shifts in crop rotation and production.  It is occurring against a ramping up of the caloric intake of a few billion new eaters in China, India, and elsewhere.  This is hardly encouraging, and it injects a modicum of doubt in predicting a significant decline in PCE inflation. We spoke about energy price dynamics earlier.  They further cloud the picture.  If you talk to Exxon or Independence, they will tell you that there is no problem in finding oil, in refining it, or in delivering the final product.  They will, however, note that there are two key impulses at work.  First, there is no evident slowdown in demand growth according to them— that is, domestically—and the appetite in the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) and in the developing countries was described as voracious.  An enormous amount of infrastructure in chemical plant capacity is being constructed everywhere, from the Gulf Coast of the United States to the Middle East to China and Singapore, in order to be nearer to either feedstock or growing final demand.  Any analysis of the income elasticity of demand for oil in low but rising income nations like China and India points to demand for oil that will grow even faster than their slightly slower but still rapidly growing income levels.  Second, price pressures on crude at the margin are compounded by noncommercial activity, which we did not talk about earlier. Noncommercial contracts, the busywork of what are called “city refiners” in the industry—that is, the city of London and the financial exchanges—have of late been running at triple their traditional volume according to Exxon’s CEO, driving oil through $90.  Thus far, gasoline and distillates, which is where the pass-through rubber hits the consumer price road, have been tame in response.  Bill discussed the low crack spread, for example.  Yet our models at the Dallas Fed for retail gasoline prices envision increases above $3 a gallon next year if crude stays above $85, which we consider a reasonable probability.  Similarly, price pressures for distillates are increasingly probable.  Finally, while currently high inventories continue, it is noteworthy that natural gas prices have reversed their summer slide downward to $5.50 per million Btu and are now quoted at $7 at the Henry Hub.  All this gives me, Mr. Chairman, a sense of discomfort, like that expressed by President Hoenig and President Plosser, on the headline inflation front and is a reminder that the balance of risk is not necessarily skewed only toward slower growth.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   No.  But I am talking about a spread being maintained between the two, and I am concerned about it, depending on where we are going to go in terms of our communication exercise, which we will talk about tomorrow.  But we don’t show as much relief on PCE inflation as the Greenbook indicates nor as the central tendency indicates, and I wanted to explain why.,   Or California."
"399";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will talk a little about the District this time. It continues to perform well, with ongoing weakness in the housing sector offset by strength in agriculture and energy.  As has been true for a while, construction activity remains mixed, with weakness in residential construction offset by continued strength in commercial construction.  In terms of residential construction, both the number of single-family permits and the value of residential construction contracts declined in September, and home inventories rose with slower home sales, as is happening elsewhere.  However, District home prices measured by the OFHEO index edged up in the second quarter and remain stronger than in the nation as a whole.  On the commercial side, after a robust spring, construction activity has slowed but has remained solid. Energy regions, such as Wyoming, report strong activity.  But even in the non-energy regions, activity remains solid.  Office vacancy rates were stable, and absorption rates declined.  In addition, developers reported more-stringent credit standards, and they expected credit availability to remain tight. Consumer spending softened in September.  Mall traffic was flat, and retailers reported that sales were down slightly.  In addition, auto dealers reported that sales fell further in September as high gasoline prices cut demand for our SUV sales and for vans.  In other areas, though, activity appears to remain at least moderate.  For example, travel and tourism remain healthy.  In addition, manufacturing activity picked up slightly in October.  Solid increases among producers of durable goods offset a weakening among producers of food, chemical, and other nondurable goods.  Even so, purchasing managers remain optimistic about future activity, as most forward-looking indexes strengthened or held steady.  Finally, we continue to see strength in agriculture and energy.  District producers are selling a bumper crop at high prices as poor crop conditions in the rest of the world trimmed global inventories and boosted export demand.  In addition, robust meat demand kept cattle and hog prices above breakeven levels. The sharp rise in farm income led to a surge in farm capital spending in the third quarter and is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter. Turning to the national economy, my outlook for growth is basically unchanged from our last meeting.  Generally speaking, economic indicators have been a bit stronger over the intermeeting period, as described here, but financial markets continue, obviously, to exhibit some stress.  The senior loan officer survey suggested moderate tightening of credit conditions.  That is consistent with our estimates of slower growth in the current quarter.  As before, though, I remain more optimistic than the Greenbook about both the near-term outlook and the longer-run growth potential for the economy.  Specifically, I think growth over the forecast period will average about 2½ percent.  My forecast is based on maintaining the fed funds rate at its current level of 4¾ percent through the middle of next year before reducing it to its more neutral level late next year or early 2009.  With regard to trend growth, I continue to expect a decline in potential growth from about 2¾ percent to 2½ percent by 2010. Disappointing housing data have led me to mark down my near-term forecast for residential investment.  I continue to expect that residential investment will decline through the first part of next year before turning up in the second half.  Also, after strong growth in the first half of this year, nonresidential construction is likely, perhaps, to slow significantly over the next year and a half.  Supporting growth in the near term will be moderate growth in consumer and government spending along with strength in exports driven by the lower dollar and robust foreign growth. Turning to the risks to the outlook, I believe they remain on the downside as far as real output but have not worsened noticeably since our last meeting, especially with that action.  I believe that construction, both residential and nonresidential, and slower consumer spending from higher energy prices constitute the main risks to the outlook.  With regard to the inflation outlook, recent data on core inflation continue to be, as noted here, favorable.  I expect core PCE inflation to average about 1.8 percent over the forecast period—remember, assuming no change in the fed funds rate—but I also expect that overall PCE inflation next year will moderate as the effects of higher food and energy prices wear off.  However, I do remain concerned about the upside risk to inflation as well.  Greater dollar depreciation and higher energy and commodity prices, along with greater pass-through from all three, could push inflation higher for a period of time.  In addition, I am also concerned about the implications of the gradual upcreep in the TIPS measures of expected inflation for the long-run path, and I am receiving more anecdotal information, in discussions with individuals in our region, about a change in expectations about inflation as they continue to deal with some rising prices in materials and other goods.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"400";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  It’s a lot smaller business than it used to be. [Laughter],   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In broad outline, the situation is evolving as we anticipated in our last meeting.  Spending outside of housing has been well maintained.  The housing market is very weak.  Financial markets have been returning more toward normal functioning, banks have tightened credit terms and standards, and core inflation has remained low.  I think it is the nuances around each of these that complicate our decision at this meeting. As Dave Stockton and others pointed out, spending outside housing has been a bit stronger than expected.  Paths of consumption and investment, along with employment, seem to be moderating going into the fourth quarter, but gradually.  Importantly, the data for September haven’t been especially weak, and these could have potentially been affected by the financial tightening, increased uncertainty, and reduced consumer confidence that followed the events of August.  With growth in the third quarter likely to be at or above 3 percent and no material change in the output gap for several quarters now, it does appear that the real funds rate of 3 percent plus that persisted since mid-2006, while quite high relative to historical averages, was not far from the equilibrium real rate at that time, given the low level of long-term rates, the ready availability of credit at historically low spreads, and the high level of wealth relative to income through this period.  It seems somewhere between difficult and impossible to calibrate the effects on aggregate demand of the rise in long-term rates last spring, the tightening of credit conditions of the past few months, and the expected decline in housing prices.  The staff has judged 50 basis points of easing—we did that at the last meeting—to be enough to keep the economy near its potential in the context of the relatively solid incoming data.  That doesn’t seem unreasonable, though it does leave the fed funds rate at the higher end of its historical range. Nonetheless, I see a couple of reasons for important downside risks to such a growth forecast.  First, though the housing market was roughly in line with staff forecasts, builders have made only a little progress in reducing inventory overhangs.  Moreover, reports suggest that downward price pressures are increasing—for example, the constant quality new home index declined in the past two quarters.  Market expectations for the Case-Shiller index revised down, suggesting that the drop in house prices could be steeper than the moderate drop assumed in the staff forecast.  Substantial decreases in house prices would at some point revive the demand for housing.  At the same time, that decline threatens greater spillovers from wealth effects on consumption and from tighter credit conditions as lenders react to threats to their capital from declining collateral values.  Second, although financial markets are improving in many respects, the trajectory is gradual, uneven, and subject to reversal.  We saw this just in the past couple of weeks, when adverse housing data, downgrades of highly rated mortgages and senior tranches, and earnings warnings caused some risk spreads to widen out.  The secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages are still quite disrupted.  Clearly, uncertainty about the pricing of many of the assets in question, about the amount of credit that will get put back to the bank balance sheets, and about the size and location of the losses that have to be taken continue to make lenders very skittish.  In this environment, I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see a further tightening of credit availability at banks in the coming months.  The developments in housing and financial markets are also likely to weigh on business spending plans, as we saw hinted at in the capital spending revisions that some of the Reserve Banks reported, and for households as evidenced by the low confidence surveys. These downside risks are strong enough that I think they will persist even if we ease slightly tomorrow.  Besides the influences I already cited, my judgment in this regard takes account of market expectations.  The markets’ implied r* has been below the staff’s and, I think, the Committee’s implied r* for some time now, but the gap seems to have widened considerably.  In an environment of increased uncertainty about the outlook, such disparities perhaps aren’t surprising, and we can’t substitute market participants’ judgment for our own, but I did take a little signal from the extent of the pessimism about aggregate demand that I inferred from the interest rate path in the market relative to the staff’s path in the Greenbook.  I don’t think r* is quite as low as President Yellen was suggesting—it is perhaps in the 2 to 2½ range since term premiums are still low; and even with house prices declining, the wealth-to-income ratios are still pretty high, and the dollar has been falling. But I did assume a slight easing of monetary policy sometime in the fourth quarter in my projection.  I also projected low, stable core and ultimately total inflation, but I do see some upside risks around this outcome if the economy follows its most likely path.  It is still producing at a high level of resource utilization, and some measures of compensation and labor costs have been rising. Core CPI inflation on three-month and six-month bases has accelerated even if the acceleration hasn’t shown through to the PCE measures.  Increases in energy and commodity prices, along with recent declines of the dollar, are also a risk factor—less from their direct effects on prices, which are likely to be small, but more because they could suggest a potential for a more inflationary psychology that could feed through to expectations.  Our decision tomorrow will involve weighing these risks, the extent of the relative risk to our dual objectives, and the potential costs of missing in either direction in the context of the market conditions and expectations built into markets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"401";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you very much.  I very much agree with Dave’s characterization of the Greenbook as a modal forecast, and I think it is an excellent and perfectly reasonable modal forecast.  As almost all of us have said, the data are coming in a little stronger. We will have a fair amount of momentum going into the fourth quarter.  We will have a significant drag from housing in ’08.  The financial markets outside of housing have generally had fairly significant improvement, although a lot of brittleness remains.  A very clear example of that is how the markets seemed to flatten out in the past week or so and certain markets backed up a bit, and thus the risk spreads are widening.  It is also interesting to note that, when the first earnings reports that were fairly negative were coming out, there was a positive market reaction because it was sort of a relief that they were owning up to the challenges.  Now that more information is coming out, some of which is more negative than had been expected, the market’s reactions have been more negative, and some of the risk spreads have been widening. That suggests that a lot of concern is still out there, and a lot of people are waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I will note that I am sure that other shoe will have been manufactured in Richmond.  [Laughter] Since this was a modal forecast, I want to think about a downside scenario, one on which I put a reasonable amount of probability mass and one that I think we should seriously consider. A number of people have talked about bank balance sheets.  Generally, there has been less concern about them than before.  One of the big issues that we had focused on earlier was leveraged lending.  That seems to be working itself out reasonably well without much incident. There is obviously a lower new flow on, but the new flow does have covenants, et cetera.  So that seems to be working out reasonably.  ABCP, SIVs, conduits—there is still uncertainty about how much may come onto the balance sheets, although there is a lot more comfort with the extent of the call on the capital that is there, but there is still uncertainty as to how much might be called.  You know, the SIVs seem to be working themselves down.  They are shrinking through orderly asset sales.  But, of course, what are they doing?  They are selling the best assets first, so the potential challenges are still left behind.  For the banks, the conforming mortgages are easy to get off the balance sheets.  There seems to be a debate about whether banks are choosing not to get nonconforming ones off the balance sheet or whether they can’t get them off the balance sheet.  Many organizations that have a lot of capital seem to be just originating these wholly on the balance sheet and waiting for better pricing, as we have heard reports from other institutions saying that they are ready, willing, and able to buy at a good price and the supply just isn’t there. Nonetheless, there is still much more carefulness in the underwriting of those loans. Obviously, the jumbo mortgages, the nonconforming mortgages, are more important than they used to be because housing prices have run up so much around the country:  $417,000 doesn’t buy you as much house anymore, even in parts of the country that don’t have or traditionally have not had particularly high housing prices.  That raises a concern about a squeeze through the mortgage markets.  So I see that the consequence of the financial turbulence is primarily highlighting issues in the mortgage markets, as a number of people have said.  Also, as I think the Greenbook and Bluebook pointed out, it is not a problem for highly rated or even just moderately well rated corporations to get funding.  That is not a challenge right now.  It seems mainly to be coming through the housing market. So I see a potential for a slow-burn scenario coming and for the housing market to slowly play itself out because we are going to have continuing negative shocks.  More than 400,000 resets are going to be coming every quarter, starting with this quarter, through 2008.  As a number of people have noted, we have much higher credit standards than before.  Many of the people who were supplying subprime loans no longer exist, and those who are supplying them are supplying them at much, much higher standards.  We will be proposing and putting out new rules.  The Congress is considering new rules.  This is all casting a pall over people who might potentially be supplying credit into some of these markets.  The delinquencies and foreclosures are clearly going to continue rising at least for a few quarters, probably—as analysis by some people at the Board suggests—peaking in mid-2008.  But there is still a lot of uncertainty with respect to that.  So it is going to continue to put more and more challenges in this market. All of these things coming together could put a lot more pressure on housing prices.  I think we have been seeing some significant declines in housing construction, but I see a potential for a reasonable likelihood of a much larger negative house-price effect than what the Greenbook has.  As a shred of evidence for that, the incredibly illiquid Case-Shiller index that is traded on the Mercantile Exchange, if you look forward, for a number of markets they have a cumulative decline of 20 percent over a couple of years.  Now, the number of players may be no more than the number of fingers that I have, but still it is a piece of data suggesting that it could be lower. The anecdotal reports are that real housing prices are much lower than the indexes are indicating. Certainly, in the new market, they are throwing in a lot of extras, add-ons, et cetera, and the inventory may actually be larger because the anecdotal reports are that a lot of people are taking their houses off the market, so they are not formally included in the enormous inventories that are out there but may well be potentially there for supply. So what does this suggest going forward?  Well, from a risk-management perspective, we ought to be thinking about buying insurance against this downside scenario.  What is the cost of insurance?  Inflation and inflation expectations.  As most people have mentioned, we have seen some gradual slowing and expectations are still being contained but, as Governor Kohn pointed out, there is a bit of an uptick in the CPI, which is definitely worrisome.  But what is the risk? Well, let us think about the upside risk.  I go back to 1998, when the FOMC cut 75 basis points. Growth was 4.5 percent in 1998 and 4.7 percent in 1999.  As I mentioned last time, we saw very little increase in inflation—actually a decline in core inflation.  I looked at the core PCE in addition to the core CPI that I reported last time, and that was effectively flat at 1.4, 1.6 percent in ’98 and ’99 and then 1.6 percent again in 2000.  The potential benefit of buying a little insurance now is that, given that a lot of these challenges may be peaking in mid-2008, it may have some effect down the line.  It provides perhaps a bit more insurance against some of the negative shocks that we may be hearing about.  If those other shoes do drop over the next few months, then we have a lower downside risk for broader financial turbulence.  Also, by mid- 2008, if the scenario that I am describing or the other negative scenarios that people have described, aren’t materializing, we can take back some of these moves.  Thank you."
"402";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Let the transcript say “groan.”  [Laughter],   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Conditions in the Fifth District’s housing sector continue to deteriorate.  Sales have weakened further across most areas, and starts have pulled back sharply.  Inventories are rising in part, we hear, because some residential investors have run short on patience and are listing their properties.  The housing correction has been particularly acute on the outer edges of the Washington, D.C., metro area, and contacts from the area anticipate that additional slowing in more-central markets is likely.  In addition, reports of home-price reductions are becoming more common around my District.  Until recently the weakness looked to be mostly contained in housing, but spillovers into other sectors are beginning to appear.  For example, our survey of the Fifth District manufacturing sector—which, by the way, is larger than the Philadelphia and New York manufacturing sectors combined—[laughter],  —and we don’t appear in Part 2 of the Greenbook—posted notably weaker readings for October.  Drilling down into the details, much of the softness can be traced to housing.,   Conditioning on the Philadelphia index, we actually have marginal predictive value for the national ISMs.  But I continue.  A modest housing spillover into business investment plans seems to be unfolding as well.  In the recent Board-commissioned survey of capital investment plans, our District was among those in which more businesses plan to trim rather than boost spending in the months ahead.  Again, a more detailed look reveals that most firms planning reductions have ties to housing.  Reports on retail sales in the District remain soft, with sales of automobiles and building materials notably weak.  In addition, an executive from a major transportation firm headquartered in the District told us that freight volumes, both rail and trucking, are now at the lowest level since the 2001 recession.  Although in a number of District markets commercial real estate activity remains healthy, we are hearing scattered reports of commercial construction projects being shelved.  One director from D.C. said that commercial development there “doesn’t have the pulse it had six weeks ago.”  The turmoil in financial markets has not appreciably constrained business lending in our District, however.  Contacts generally describe credit as readily available to creditworthy borrowers, but some say spreads have widened a bit.  On the price front, our monthly measures suggest some moderation in growth despite ongoing complaints of higher input costs. At our last meeting, I was more optimistic than the Greenbook on the national economy.  A significant part of the difference was related to housing, where I saw greater probability of the drag receding sooner.  Longer term, I had a somewhat higher estimate of trend productivity growth, which supported a somewhat stronger outlook for household consumption.  The main shift in my perspective since the last meeting is that I am now at least as pessimistic as the Greenbook about prospects for housing bottoming out anytime soon.  The 10 percent fall in housing starts in September was certainly eye catching, and it indicates that the weak summer housing market tailed off further toward the end.  In our District, and this seems to be true elsewhere as well, the housing downturn appears to have spread into many formerly unaffected markets.  It is hard for me to believe that any discernible stabilization is likely before the spring, when the seasonal pickup in housing activity typically takes place.  Even then a prolonged period of depressed activity seems more likely than any noticeable bounceback.  Other recent news suggests a bit more demand-side fallout from the housing market than I had been expecting.  Manufacturing production was sluggish in August and September, and durable goods orders have shown only modest growth, especially outside the aircraft industry.  I mentioned a minute ago that our survey of the Fifth District manufacturing sector—which, by the way, is larger than the Philadelphia and New York manufacturing sector—[laughter] is showing a significant slowdown for October, particularly in housing-related industries. Consumer spending has been a source of stability during this housing correction, and I expect that to remain true over the forecast period.  I think household spending will generally expand in line with disposable income, but even though consumption advanced broadly in the third quarter, it now seems we’re in for a bit of a slowdown this quarter.  In that regard, I’m feeling sympathy for what President Yellen said.  So I’m less sanguine overall about the near-term outlook for growth at this meeting, although that may just represent catching up on my part to the Greenbook’s past level of gloominess. Having said all that, I do believe that the effects of this summer’s financial market adjustments are likely to be limited; and out beyond the middle of the next year, I’m, again, more optimistic than the Greenbook and for the usual reasons.  I think that productivity growth and, thus, real income growth will be somewhat higher than in the Greenbook forecast, and my outlook for the personal saving rate is centered on its current value rather than a steady increase. Inflation appears to have ticked up a bit in September, at least according to the CPI.  Still, year-over-year core PCE inflation remained reasonably contained, and I’ve been struck by the extent to which TIPS inflation compensation has held relatively steady in recent months, especially given our easing move last month and the run-up in oil prices.  While I would like to see inflation come down further, I’m somewhat more comfortable about inflation than I was at the beginning of the year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"403";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I have noted in the past, the industrial mix in the Sixth District looks a lot like the country as a whole.  The regional data and anecdotal information show that, although the Sixth District economy is still expanding, the pace is marginally weaker than it was in September.  In earlier meetings I commented on the severity of the housing situation in the District.  There is no improvement in sight for the housing market, and there are signs that the sharp decline in residential construction is spilling over into nonresidential real estate segments, such as shopping center development.  Employment growth is softening as well. Although the largest negative effects are in construction-related sectors, the slowdown in job growth appears to be fairly broad based. The broad contour of our national forecast is similar to the Greenbook baseline.  Like the Greenbook, our forecast includes a slowing in business investment.  Based on our survey of District business contacts, it appears that the low levels of expected capital expenditure are due mainly to pessimism about the pace of economic activity rather than restrictive credit conditions per se. Specifically, financial market turbulence does not appear to have directly affected economic activity, but it has created a greater uncertainty about the outlook for the economy.  As a consequence, the majority of my directors and business contacts are reporting very little in the way of plans to increase capital expenditures in the coming year.  Where business investment is discretionary, most respondents report a wait-and-see posture. More positively, the weaker dollar does appear to be having a positive effect on exports from the region.  For the year to date, the dollar value of exports through the Sixth District ports was up 35 percent through August, whereas import growth was only 21 percent.  Not coincidentally, the majority of businesses that indicated they were increasing capital expenditures over the coming months were exporters. In the run-up to this FOMC meeting, I again made calls to a few financial market participants, and they reflected a range of institutional and market perspectives.  A synthesis of this opinion is consistent with the views that were expressed earlier by Bill Dudley and others.  There’s a widespread view that persistent volatility in credit markets is bound to negatively affect the general economy.  Credit market conditions have improved somewhat, but stability may be a long way off.  A second wave of volatility may accompany incoming details regarding mortgage delinquencies caused by rate resets in 2008, and there’s a suspicion that third-quarter writedowns may be followed by substantial further losses recognized at year-end.  Also, as referenced in the Bluebook, there is skepticism about the M-LEC (master liquidity enhancement conduit) proposal from several angles. In summary, our soundings of the economy, informed by formal modeling work, point to a continued slowing of the economy that will likely persist well into next year.  Anecdotally, credit constraints outside the housing sector do not appear to be a major factor at this stage.  But uncertainty created by financial market turbulence does seem to be acting as a constraint, and I believe that the heightened uncertainty regarding the economic outlook for 2008 warrants consideration of insurance against this downside risk. With respect to the outlook for inflation, I agree with the view expressed by others that recent developments in energy prices, if they persist, make it likely that we are about to enter another period in which headline numbers substantially exceed the trends suggested by core measures.  Because of this, I feel it’s appropriate to characterize inflation risk as having increased. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"404";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast is actually quite similar to the Greenbook forecast.  In terms of inflation, I see a little faster movement back to 2 percent, where I think inflation expectations are grounded, but the difference is very minor.  I do think the risks are quite balanced around that.  In terms of economic growth, I am fairly comfortable with the Greenbook forecast, maybe a smidgen less sanguine in the next two quarters but really not very different.  However, in terms of the issue of potential downside risk, I do think that, given the policy path that the Greenbook assessed, there are substantial downside risks and they come from several sources.  One source is that the financial market disruptions have led to some tightening of lending standards.  I think that could have some potential effect on business investment.  The housing market is pretty grim.  We still have a big inventory overhang, and there is a question about whether that large inventory overhang is going to lead to even fewer housing starts than the Greenbook has forecasted.  Furthermore, it has raised the issue about house prices, which have spillovers into household spending.  The spreads for commercial real estate are still very high, and so there is a question about whether commercial real estate will be as strong as it has been.  That is a bit worrisome as well.  Consumer confidence has not deteriorated too much, but it has been on a path of deterioration.  So, again, I worry a little about what the consumer might do.  In general, I worry more about these downside risks, given the policy path of keeping the federal funds rate constant. What about the financial markets and their disruptions?  Well, I think that there are two elements to the disruption in these big, widening credit spreads.  One is the valuation risk:  All of a sudden people realized that they didn’t know as much about what kind of assets were in portfolios and how complicated the structures were in terms of those assets.  Clearly, the solution to that problem is price discovery.  We see that happening, but it is going to be very slow.  So that problem, in terms of the credit markets, will take a fair amount of time to resolve.  The second element is what I call macro risk, which is the concern about a downward spiral:  The problems in the credit markets will lead to a weakening of the economy, which then makes price discovery harder to do, which means that you have wider credit spreads, which then make things worse.  Of course, that’s the issue with the tail risk that all of us have been talking about.  I think the policy change that we did in September clearly had a big impact.  It did exactly what we wanted it to do.  It is almost a textbook case in doing what we wanted it to do—it took out a lot of the macro risk.  It didn’t take out the valuation risk, which is getting better but very slowly over time. So looking at this issue and thinking about going forward in terms of the credit markets, I am a little worried that credit markets are still quite skittish.  That has several elements.  One is the danger that macro risk could come back.  So there is a question about shoes dropping.  There is an issue about what we might do at this meeting, and then there are issues about what might actually happen that people don’t know about.  One thing that is sort of surprising is that, when you look at what is happening in credit spreads, they seem pretty reasonable in their steady but very slow improvement.  But then, you sense some discomfort—in particular, the reaction to the Treasury superconduit has not been very positive.  If it worked, it would actually reveal information because it would look like the way that the old clearinghouses used to work, when they would combine assets.  Randy knows all about this because he studied this stuff.  You pool your assets, then you monitor each other, and then you actually create information that makes the markets work better.  I think that is what the Treasury was trying to get at.  But the skepticism in the markets is such that they think this could be used to hide information about assets and that other shoes may be dropping in this regard.  This does not give me a lot of confidence, and so I worry very much at this juncture, which I think is a critical one, that a policy move could have an effect of sending the credit markets in a bad direction.  That is something we have to take into account tomorrow.  Thank you."
"405";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in the District economic conditions since our September meeting.  Except for housing, activity is expanding at a modest pace, somewhat below trend.  Our business contacts are cautious, generally expecting slow growth to continue over the next quarter, but they remain fairly optimistic for business conditions six to twelve months out.  Payroll employment continues to expand at a slow pace in our three states, which partially reflects slow population growth, and so the unemployment rate remains slightly below that of the nation.  Retail sales have generally held up, but there are divergent views among retailers regarding holiday sales.  High-end stores expect a very strong finish to the year; lower-end merchants are more cautious.  Housing construction and sales continue to decline, but the pace of that decline is in line with the expectations at our last meeting.  The value of nonresidential building contracts has declined more sharply in our region than in the nation as a whole.  Nevertheless, I would characterize nonresidential real estate markets as firm.  That office vacancy rates are declining and commercial rents are rising suggests a positive outlook for commercial construction going forward. According to our business outlook survey, manufacturing activity in the District has been increasing at a modest pace for the past several months.  The general index of economic activity moved down slightly, from 10.9 in September to 6.9.  Shipments and new orders also weakened slightly.  Staff analysis suggests that our manufacturing index, which precedes the release of national industrial production numbers, provides useful information in forecasting monthly manufacturing IP and total IP.  That forecasting model is predicting a rise in both manufacturing IP and total IP in October.  About two-thirds of the District manufacturers and service-sector firms we have polled said that recent changes in financial conditions have not prompted any change in their capital spending plans, and the other firms are about evenly split as expecting a slight decrease or a slight increase over the next six to twelve months compared with the past six to twelve months.  However, in speaking with my business contacts, I do hear a sense of continuing caution among businesses in their capital spending plans.  The manufacturers seem to be a bit stronger than the service firms, perhaps reflecting a more robust export market, which many of them are participating in.  District bankers, in general, continue to express concern over housing and mortgage lending but see commercial and industrial lending as fairly stable and proceeding about as they had expected. There has been little change in the District’s inflation picture since our last meeting. Firms continue to report higher benefit costs, but other wage pressures have moderated.  Our manufacturers reported having to pay higher prices for many inputs, particularly energy-related inputs and petroleum-based products as well as agricultural commodities.  They have passed on many of those increases in terms of higher prices to their consumers.  While retailers report only modest price increases for many products, food prices are generally higher. In summary, since our last meeting, there has been little change in the economic conditions in the District or in the outlook for the region.  Overall, business activity in the region is advancing at a fairly modest pace, and most of our contacts expect that pace to continue for the next quarter or so.  But in general, firms in the District remain optimistic about business six to twelve months from now. Turning to the nation, the economy appears less vulnerable to me than it did at the time of our last meeting.  Financial markets have improved somewhat, as Bill Dudley was telling us. Conditions are not back to normal yet in all segments of the market, but the markets that are still under stress are the same ones that were under stress last month.  Subprime and jumbo mortgages and asset-backed commercial paper are the ones that still are struggling.  Price discovery still plagues many of these markets, and I suspect it will take some time before the markets can sort things out and trading returns to normal.  That does not mean that the ultimate agreed-upon market prices for some of these assets will bear any resemblance to what they looked like before August.  Indeed, they probably won’t, but that’s not necessarily a bad sign or a cause for concern; it may even be a healthy development.  We haven’t seen disruption spread to other asset classes for the most part, and the level of stress in financial markets seems to have fallen even as volatility remains high.  The spread of jumbo over conventional mortgage rates remains elevated, reflecting some concern, I think, about the risk that expensive homes may face greater price declines than other homes, but the premium is less than it was in September. Both investment-grade and non-investment-grade corporate bond issues have increased. Financial institutions have begun to write off some of their investments and take the losses.  This has weighed heavily on equity markets, but I view the write-downs as a necessary part of the process toward stabilization in the markets.  Earnings reports from nonfinancial firms have actually been pretty favorable.  I’m not saying that we are out of the woods yet, but in my view the risks for a serious meltdown in financial markets have lessened somewhat since our last meeting. The news on general economic activity has improved somewhat since our last meeting as well.  Indeed, some of the data have come in better than expected.  Employment was revised up, and retail sales data suggest that consumer spending remains resilient, despite the downturn in housing.  Like the Greenbook, my outlook for the economy has changed little since our last meeting, when we acted preemptively and lowered rates to “forestall some of the potential adverse effects of financial market disruptions and the expected intensification of the housing correction on the broader economy.”  Housing investment and sales continue to decline but about as expected in our forecast.  After all, the rapid reduction in subprime lending is exacerbating the decline in housing demand and thus home sales, contributing to the slower recovery of that sector.  Other sectors of the economy have performed about as I expected, with little evidence as yet of any major spillovers from housing.  Oil prices have moved higher than expected since our last meeting, as has been discussed, but it is unclear to me yet how permanent that increase will be or how much of a drag it might be on activity.  The oil price rise is likely to show through to headline inflation in the coming months.  Although core inflation measures have improved since the beginning of the year, the rise in energy prices has the potential to put upward pressure on core inflation.  Thus, while inflation and inflationary expectations have been stable to date, I suspect that inflation risks are now more to the upside than they were in September. The forecast is an important context for our policy, in my view.  We have stressed in the past year that we are data driven and respond to the evolution of our forecast.  In general, like the Greenbook, as I said, my forecast of the economy going forward is little changed from my September view.  I see that growth returns to trend, which I estimate to be about 2.7—a little higher than the Greenbook—late in 2008 as the housing correction runs its course and the financial market turbulence unwinds.  Core PCE inflation remains slightly below 2 percent next year and moderates toward my goal of 1½ percent by 2010.  I built in a 25 basis point easing sometime in early 2008 to bring the funds rate back down to a more neutral level, and in my baseline forecast I assume a constant funds rate thereafter.  That forecast, however, is contingent on inflation and inflationary expectations remaining well behaved.  Having said that, I repeat my caution that inflationary pressures are somewhat elevated at this point, and we run the risk that inflationary expectations may become unhinged if the markets suspect that we have lessened our commitment to keep inflation contained.  Thus, I don’t rule out the possibility that we may have to reverse course and tighten policy sometime in 2008 or 2009 in order to achieve consistency between my target rate of inflation of 1½ and inflationary expectations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.,   We can’t help it if you have no predictive content.  [Laughter]"
"406";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to concentrate on the outlook for the nonhousing part.  I think the housing sector is obviously in miserable condition, and the issue as to where that’s going to go really depends on how much of it spreads to other parts of the economy. Now, I have a contact with a large software firm, and the headline there is that things are going great—in fact, going gangbusters, I would say.  Computer hardware sales nationally are running at 14 to 16 percent above last year, about 3 percentage points above expectation.  Business IT growth is around 12 percent.  Export sales are good.  Server business is good.  Computer gaming software is strong.  Just overall a very bullish outlook there.  Capital expenditures at this company are up about 35 percent this fiscal year over last fiscal year and are expected to be up another 15 percent in fiscal 2009.  So the outlook is uniformly very, very strong.  The company says it is behind in hiring and has lots of unfilled positions partly as a consequence of turnover. Now, all the other contacts were pretty downbeat.  UPS is expecting a peak season that is milder than in the previous years; my contact believes that the economy is not going into a negative but is clearly slowing down.  The company is leasing eleven fewer aircraft this year.  To meet the peak, they always lease extra planes for shipping.  They are probably holding about steady on capital outlays.  My contact at FedEx says that the outlook is very soft, not much buildup toward the holiday peak.  The retailers that they talked to are anticipating a softer season, not an absolute decline, but slow growth.  International business remains very strong.  This company is reducing capital expenditures by 10 percent from its previous expectation.  My contact in a major company in the trucking industry says that we are in a recession, the worst he has seen in twenty to forty years. The company is reducing its fleet size by 10 percent, is cutting capital spending quite substantially, and has no good news.  A contact with a major money center bank said that the bank’s analysis of credit card usage indicates that sales have been flat in some areas and are declining in others.  Credit card usage for department store and catalogue sales has been declining.  In an e-mail I received after that conversation, my contact painted a weaker picture than had been discussed the previous day.  I think that there are other comments around the table suggesting that the anecdotal reports are a bit on the weak side. Now, to me there is a puzzle in the market’s assessment of the outcome of this meeting. The market has essentially bid in a probability of 1.0 of either a 25 or a 50 basis point cut.  If I were simply following the flow of news, the general flow of news putting housing aside has been okay, maybe a little stronger than expected, and following this fed funds futures market for a long time, it does respond to the current information.  The flow of data clearly moves that market, and if that were all that were driving the market, I guess I would have anticipated a 50-50 split between no change in the fed funds target and down 25 basis points.  So why has the market bid in such a high probability of a cut at this time?  I’ll offer a hypothesis, which is that a number of people who are players in this market, like my contact at a large bank, are looking at news and saying that the proprietary inside information they have on what’s going on leads them to believe that the overall economy has a soft tone to it that is not yet showing up in the data that we follow.  I’m throwing out that hypothesis.  I don’t know what other hypothesis to offer, but it does seem to be a reasonable one.  Thank you."
"407";"MR. ROSENGREN.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Boston forecast is very close to that of the Greenbook.  With the constant federal funds rate assumption, the economy is very close to full employment, and core inflation is close to 2 percent at the end of 2008.  Such an outcome is consistent with what I would hope to achieve with appropriate monetary policy. However, while this is an expected path that seems quite reasonable, the distribution of risks around that outcome for growth remains skewed to the downside.  Our forecast, like that of the Greenbook, expects particularly weak residential investment.  Problems in financing mortgages, expectations of falling housing prices, and more-severe financial stress for homebuilders are likely to weigh heavily over the next two quarters.  In fact, our forecast for residential investment has become sufficiently bleak that there may actually be some upside risk to it.  [Laughter] Somewhat surprising to me has been the lack of spillover to the rest of the economy from the problems in residential investment.  I remain concerned that falling housing prices will further sap consumer confidence and cause a pullback in consumption, though to date there is little evidence of a significant effect of the housing problems on consumer spending.  Similarly, I would have expected the financing problems that have aggravated the housing situation to have caused a sharper reduction in investment in general and in nonresidential structures in particular. However, so far these remain risks rather than outcomes.  Thus, while I am worried about the downside risks, I am reminded that forecasters have frequently overestimated the consequences of liquidity problems in the past. On the financial side, there have definitely been improvements in market conditions, though markets remain fragile.  Particularly worrisome has been the announcement of significant downgrades of tranches of CDOs and mortgage-backed securities with large exposure to the subprime mortgage market.  Not only have the lower tranches experienced significant downgrades, but a number of the AAA and AA tranches have been downgraded to below investment grade.  Some investors cannot retain below-investment-grade securities and are forced to sell these securities in an already depressed market.  The number of the downgrades, the magnitude of the downgrades, and the piecemeal ratings announcements all are likely to call into further question the reliability of the ratings process.  If many high-grade securities tied to mortgages are downgraded to below investment grade, some investors may conclude that repricing of even high-graded tranches does not reflect a liquidity problem but rather a substantial reevaluation of credit risk.  Thus, I am concerned that continued widespread downgrades may make recovery in the securitization market more difficult, particularly for nonconforming mortgages, with a consequent increase in the financing cost of these assets.  I also remain concerned that the asset-backed commercial paper market remains fragile.  While investors seem to be distinguishing between conduits whose structure or underlying assets are quite risky, my sense is that money managers are watching the market quite closely.  I continue to hear concerns over the possibility that some money market funds will experience losses that will not be supported by their parents, resulting in increased investor concern with the safety of money market funds more generally. On balance, the data both on the real economy and on financial markets have improved since our September meeting.  That improvement makes it more likely that the economy will continue to recover gradually from the financial turmoil.  However, both the real and the financial risks remain skewed to the downside."
"408";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There really have not been any significant changes in economic conditions or trends in the District.  Moderate expansion is continuing.  The special survey we did on financial conditions and whether the changes there had affected capital spending plans suggested that plans, at least for firms in our District, were largely unaffected. Contacts with insight into the shipping industry do report that exports are very strong, stronger than at least they had anticipated.  That, of course, is consistent with what we have been seeing in some of the aggregate data. As far as the national economy is concerned, I agree with the Greenbook’s assessment of the incoming information that we received since the last Committee meeting.  I won’t rehash it here, except to say that the surprises have been positive, a bit on the upside, and I think we still—at least at the aggregate level—haven’t seen generalized spillovers from the contraction in housing activity or prices on overall economic activity.  I also agree with the Greenbook’s assessment of the outlook for the economy for the next two or three quarters.  I think growth is likely to be subdued as a consequence of the changes in financial conditions that we’ve seen.  As far as prices are concerned, core inflation seems to me to be relatively well contained at least on a year-over-year basis, and I expect that performance to be maintained as long as we pursue appropriate policy. Looking at the overall economic outlook beyond the next two or three quarters, I think there is a reasonable chance, given recent developments and recent actions, that by the middle of next year, say, we’ll be looking at real economic growth of something close to what the economy has averaged over the past six years—that is, the period 2002 through 2007.  This is a bit more favorable, a bit higher, than the Greenbook outlook, and as best I can judge, the Greenbook is more conservative than I am about the nonconsumption, nonresidential investment components of aggregate demand.  Put another way, those components add a bit less to aggregate demand in the Greenbook than I would expect.  But my real point is that I don’t think it is a great stretch to see pretty respectable growth by the middle of next year.  My reading of the projections package that was briefly discussed earlier suggests to me that at least some have the same view.  Of course, that improvement could occur even sooner given the uncertainty associated with forecasting short-term perturbations in the economy.  Thank you."
"409";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought I’d just talk about four subjects today: first, spend a few more moments on the capital market conditions, which Bill did a great job of summarizing; second, talk about financial intermediaries; and third and fourth, talk briefly about implications for growth and inflation.  In terms of the capital markets, I think it is important that we judge their state today not from where they might have been two weeks ago or from where they might have gotten ahead of underlying reality—if you look at credit spreads and equities—but from where they were before we last met or from where they were in the darkest days of August.  I think these markets are at the very high end of what are reasonable expectations for improvement.  As Governor Kohn suggests, it doesn’t mean that they can’t reverse themselves.  It certainly doesn’t mean that they are solid—plenty of fragility is there.  But all things considered, as a function of both time and Fed policy, there is, indeed, better sentiment; bid-asked spreads have narrowed; price discovery is at work; and differentiation and tiering are very real.  I’d highlight a few markets that have gone into the category of being on more solid ground.  Bill referred to the interbank funding markets.  The multiseller bank-sponsored conduit is performing well.  Prime auto finance paper has gone through quite a volatile period in the past couple of months but has now found its way to the good side, where I think those markets are increasingly open.  High-quality paper is increasingly being received on terms that don’t look dramatically different from the way they would have looked before August.  Another example is credit card receivables. Of course, as many others around this table have pointed out, there is no panacea.  Serious problems remain in some asset markets, particularly housing and certain parts of structured finance. But I note that might be for good reason.  I’d hesitate to call this poor market functioning.  By and large, it may be that some investors don’t like the outcomes, but as the asset-backed commercial paper markets have separated the haves from the have-nots and the have-nots are without bank sponsorship and have poorer quality assets and poorer disclosure, they are having a hard time finding and securing bids.  Another example might be some large financial institutions that are rolling over more of their funding on a shorter-term basis than they desire.  There may be good reasons for that, and as we think about our policy tools tomorrow, we shouldn’t try to come to the rescue with any fixes for institutions that may not have been managed well or, at least, may not have had a capital structure that fit the risks.  There are a couple of other indicators of continued concern. Obviously, the Treasury bill market has been quite volatile and is a pretty good reminder to us that these markets are not back to anything that we’d even want to consider normal.  Another indicator that I look to in evaluating whether the capital markets are coming back to some normalcy is the percentage of cash holdings in money market mutual funds.  In the pre-July period, money market mutual funds, particularly those that hold these prime-plus securities, would hold 5 to 10 percent of their assets in cash.  On the darkest day in August, that was up to 45 percent.  By and large, my sense is that the average now is something in the mid-20s.  That suggests that there might be requests for redemptions and liquidations for which they need to keep cash available, but they are feeling a little better about their prospects and about some of the paper that they’re holding. On balance, I’d say it’s pretty easy for us to sit here and judge improvement.  It’s a lot harder for us to judge success.  I think President Plosser talked about the normalization in these markets, and we must hesitate to think that the markets before their August turmoil were normal. Risk premiums were abnormally low, and access to credit perhaps unusually easy.  So in judging the success of time in our policy prescriptions, I think we’re having a hard time—at least I’m having a hard time—figuring out what are the new steady-state outcomes that are trying to be achieved. These markets appear delicately balanced between fear and greed.  One example of greed, as we discussed in previous meetings, is some of the pay-in-kind, or PIK, securities with toggle features in the high-yield market.  One of them was priced just last week between 97 and 98.  So some of these corporate credits may well have improved in the eyes of the market beyond what we think might be sustainable.  On the other side is fear.  A new paradigm is trying to take root in the markets, but the risk of reversal remains very real.  The marks on many leveraged loans look good.  But if you judge the financial institutions that hold this paper, they are rushing to get the paper to market as soon as they possibly can, perhaps with a view that the corporate credit conditions won’t hold at these levels. Second, let me talk briefly about financial intermediaries.  As we discussed before, after the tumult in mid-August, many of them retrenched.  Then many of them tried to re-liquefy.  At that time they were trying to revalue their securities.  Now they are probably somewhere in the process of revaluation, review, and refinement.  Some of them, after the earnings announcements of the past couple of weeks, might be going back to step 1 and trying to understand what the risks are and what their liabilities are.  Some of the improvements that we saw in the capital markets after our September 18 meeting might have been upended or seemed so by a couple of announcements from a leading investment bank and commercial bank that represented a negative surprise to the markets. A couple of explanations are possible for why the market seemed to react not just with respect to the securities of those two banks.  Were the losses and risk-management systems particular to those banks that called the risk management into question, or were they illustrative of losses to larger segments of their peer group owing to poor risk-management systems?  It was probably a combination, but I guess the key question for me is whether we are seeing impairment of the entire financial sector or simply the realignment of the competitive landscape.  I think the answer is the latter, but I’m not certain.  The best-in-class comparables among commercial banks and investment banks seem to suggest that bifurcation is at work.  If you look at the credit default swaps, at the profits, and at the share prices for the best in class of this group, they seem to have come out of the scare of a couple of weeks ago stronger and more profitable and, frankly, in much better shape.  I would have thought that those sorts of entities would be putting opportunistic capital to work in a hurry, particularly when many of their competitors are down.  I’m afraid that is not the case.  Even they are playing defense in this market.  We talk, I talk, about the resilience of our capital markets. What they tell many of us, I think, is that the way for them to be resilient is to be exceptionally prudent here.  The risk-reward tradeoff for them suggests that this is a time to be careful.  You can’t succeed if you don’t survive, and I suspect that many of them are still quite jarred by recent events. The profitability of most of these financial institutions has been significantly called into question.  I suspect that the losses in the fourth quarter are going to look particularly bad, but I would expect that many of these financial institutions are asking themselves the question of what business they really should be in after all. Third, let me speak briefly about the implications for economic growth.  To me there is no question that we have less market uncertainty than two months ago, and the prospects of some really bad tail events have dissipated somewhat; but there is still caution, as Vice Chairman Geithner said.  Certainly, large multinational nonfinancial companies, excluding housing, seem to be holding up well, as represented by their bottom-up S&P earnings forecast for the fourth quarter of next year, and certainly there’s good news to report, as President Poole suggested, from many in the tech sector.  Housing is, of course, as bad as the Greenbook has long suggested.  So at the end of the day in terms of trying to judge what’s going on in the real economy, we go back to a discussion the Greenbook highlighted for us, which is the state of the consumer.  Even though on balance I am a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook for GDP growth for the balance of ’07 and ’08, I have to admit that the conclusion that consumer sentiment has taken a hit seems, at least from my reading and my discussions with some business leaders, to be backed up by some very disappointing consumer spending for October.  Having surveyed a few of the credit card companies, I think that it looks to many of them that October spending is really not at comforting levels.  Nominal spending excluding fuel for their consumer base appears flat to down over the past four weeks.  That is, I think, a rather remarkable outcome.  Delinquencies have also ticked up a bit, but I would say that’s probably less disconcerting to me than what the credit card companies seem to be reporting as a proxy for retail spending.  The key over the medium term, however, is job growth and real disposable income, in my judgment more important than the negative wealth effects from housing. Let me turn to the final issue for discussion—at least on my list—which is inflation risks. At the end of this six-week period, I must admit to being considerably less sanguine about inflation prospects and risks than the Greenbook.  It is true that incoming data have not been bad at all.  Some have even been pretty good, and inflation expectations are seemingly anchored.  But as Governor Kohn suggested, I worry a lot about inflation psychology and the real effect of importing inflation given dollar weakness and the effect of commodity price increase pass-throughs on a breadth of products.  Given the massive liquidity on the sidelines, given uncertainty in the global capital markets and the current political calendar, and given the rather large and growing expected discrepancies in interest rate differentials between us and our trading partners, I worry about outsized moves between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies.  A disorderly move in the dollar could prove very costly, even undermining foreign direct investment in the United States and perhaps threatening to unanchor inflation expectations, particularly if the judgments of this Committee aren’t well understood by the markets.  I have never been a big believer in looking at artificial levels for prices or at charts to figure out where we should worry.  Nonetheless, I must say a euro-dollar move beyond 150 strikes me as a level that the markets will be paying keen attention to.  We’ll obviously talk about the policy tradeoffs involving these risks in the next round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"410";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many others around the table, my report to this Committee in September indicated a sharp deterioration in business confidence.  My business contacts were concerned about what may happen.  During the intermeeting period I heard less about what may happen and more about what is actually happening.  My contacts who are linked to residential real estate have seen a further and, in some cases, sharp drop-off in business activity.  My banking supervision and regulation staff told me just a few days ago that they’re now seeing a sudden and sizable percentage increase in nonperforming loans at a number of large banking companies in my District.  To be sure, nonperforming loans had been at extremely low levels, and most of the sharp rise can be traced to mortgage and construction development lending.  But I’m now beginning to hear reports that bankers are experiencing some loan performance problems outside their real estate portfolio.  The CEO of a large, major bank in my District has also reported difficulty in securitizing the student loans that they’re making, forcing them to keep those loans on their books and to make adjustments elsewhere in their balance sheets.  To what extent these banking conditions are affecting overall bank lending is not obvious, but clearly there has been some disruption to the channels of intermediation, and I am now beginning to hear reports of some spillover to other sectors of the economy.  A growing number of retailers tell me that they have seen a noticeable decline in spending since mid-September in items ranging from autos to apparel. While my reports from the business community reflect a falloff in business conditions from what we submitted to the Beige Book just a few weeks ago, they don’t necessarily indicate a significant deviation from the slowdown that was already built into the economic projections that I submitted in September.  In preparing for this meeting, I found it difficult to judge whether the reports of weakness that I am hearing represent an unfolding of the September projection or additional deterioration in the outlook.  In the end, I have only minor differences with the Greenbook projection in the near term and, like the Greenbook, made only minor revisions to my forecast.  I see economic activity a bit softer than the Greenbook for the remainder of 2007, but I project slightly better growth in 2008.  Like the Greenbook, I have assumed an unchanged path for the fed funds rate over the forecast period.  The recent rise in oil prices has caused me to push up my near-term PCE projection, but inflation expectation projections remain anchored around 2 percent.  I see a small upside risk to the near-term inflation projection as a result of the continuing dollar depreciation; but on the whole, I continue to judge our inflation risks as reasonably balanced. I would like to conclude by echoing the sentiments of others around the table.  Considerable strains in the financial sector remain, and further turmoil in markets is a distinct possibility.  I think that, in this environment, households and businesses can easily be spooked—excuse the Halloween pun—and I don’t think it would take much additional tightness in credit markets to push my fragile near-term growth outlook even lower.  So this concern continues to be the predominant risk to my outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"411";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the past week or so, we have been following the devastating fires in Southern California.  They have burned over 500,000 acres, destroyed nearly 2,000 homes, and inflicted seven deaths and sixty injuries.  These were large fires, even by California standards, but they were by no means the largest in recent memory; and, of course, the loss of life and economic costs pale compared with Katrina.  While the fires have seriously affected the lives of many individuals, they do not seem likely to show up in the macroeconomic data. Turning to the national economy, developments since we met six years—six weeks ago—actually, it seems like just two weeks ago—[laughter] generally have been favorable and the risks to the outlook for growth have eased somewhat.  But I think it is too early to say that we are out of the woods.  The inflation news has continued to be favorable, but some upside risks have become more prominent.  With respect to economic activity, we have raised our forecast for growth in both the third and the fourth quarters in response to incoming data, even though the pace of deterioration in the housing sector has been more severe than we expected and the problems associated with housing finance seem far from resolution.  We agree with Greenbook that residential investment is likely to continue its severe contraction for at least a few more quarters.  We also agree with Greenbook that the rest of the economy has held up reasonably well, at least so far.  Exports have been strong, and while business fixed investment seems to be slowing, it should still make a robust contribution to growth in the second half of this year. With respect to consumer spending, most aggregate data suggest only a modest deceleration so far.  Such readings help to allay our concerns about potential spillovers from housing to consumption, but they don’t completely assuage them.  Survey measures of consumer confidence are down sharply since the financial turmoil began, and most indexes of house prices show outright declines.  Given the current state of the housing and mortgage markets, bigger declines going forward are a distinct possibility.  Indeed, the Case-Shiller futures data for house prices point to larger declines in the months ahead.  A sharp drop in house prices would likely crimp consumer spending over time through wealth and collateral effects.  Some of my directors and other contacts are also raising warning flags about consumer demand.  For example, the CEO of a large well-known high-end retailer said that the company’s sales are softening and that the company is having to work diligently to control inventories.  In his view, the consumer has pulled back.  The CEO of a Southern California bank observed a number of his clients talking about a drop in discretionary consumer purchases.  The bottom line is that consumption spending seems to be all right for the time being, but there is a real risk that households may cut back on spending more than expected in response to higher oil prices, a slower economy, and economic uncertainty. I agree with President Rosengren’s assessment of financial markets.  Strains appear to have eased a bit on balance since our September meeting, with interbank lending markets showing some improvement and spreads on asset-backed commercial paper declining.  But structured credits related to mortgages remain quite troublesome, and liquidity conditions and Treasury bill markets are still at times strained.  My impression is that, despite having moved in a positive direction over the past six weeks, these markets remain vulnerable to shocks, and so the economy remains at risk from further financial disruptions.  Both survey evidence and anecdotal evidence have confirmed that banks are tightening lending standards across the board. Tighter terms and conditions are being applied to a range of business lending, including commercial real estate, and on most household lending from prime and nonprime mortgages to auto and home equity loans. The main financial variables that are commonly included in formal macroeconometric models appear to have changed since the onset of the financial shock—say, in late June—in ways that should have roughly offsetting effects.  Oil prices are markedly higher, which should restrain consumer spending, and the stock market is roughly unchanged since June in spite of the financial turmoil.  A weaker dollar should have a positive influence on growth.  Mortgages rates on jumbo loans and the rates facing the riskiest corporate borrowers are higher, but many private borrowing rates are down because of the decline in Treasury yields.  Of course, the current levels of Treasury yields, as well as the stock market and dollar, reflect at least in part the market’s expectation that the Committee will ease the stance of monetary policy at this meeting. Underlying our forecast is the policy assumption that the Committee will cut the funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting.  In assessing the appropriate path of the stance of policy, I took a number of considerations into account.  First, core consumer inflation currently is at a level that I consider consistent with price stability.  Second, unemployment is very near my best estimate of the full employment rate.  In the context of a Taylor-type rule, these considerations imply that the real funds rate should be near its neutral level.  In fact, any version of the Taylor rule you prefer, with whatever rates you want to put on inflation versus the gap, will give you the same recommendation because all the terms are zero and drop out, except for one—the equilibrium real rate.  Of course, we cannot know the level of the real equilibrium rate with certainty.  Defined in terms of the PCE price index, our best estimate is in the range of 2 to 2½ percent, which is well below the current real rate of about 3 percent. I would like to highlight two additional points here.  First, the actual real rate has been boosted over the past six months or so by declines in short-term inflation expectations, whether one measures them by lagged inflation, by surveys of expected inflation over the next year or so, or by forecasts of inflation including the Greenbook forecast.  Second, one important aspect of the financial turmoil is that it probably represents in part a movement toward a more reasonable pricing of risk, as seen in the rise in risk spreads.  This development tends to push the equilibrium real funds rate down toward the lower portion of the range I just cited. The bottom line is that in my view, even without the contractionary effects of recent financial developments, an appropriate stance of monetary policy would involve further declines in the fed funds rate.  I have assumed that the funds rate drops to 4½ percent by the end of this year and to 4¼ by the end of next year.  My assumed path ends in the same place and embodies the same medium-term assumption concerning neutral as FRB/US, on which the extended Greenbook forecast relies.  The only difference concerns timing.  We assume a more rapid path to the long run than the Greenbook does.  Our forecast shows real GDP growth gradually picking up to around 2½ percent, our estimate of potential, by the end of next year.  However, given that the financial shock is not yet resolved, I think the downside risks to this forecast predominate. With regard to inflation, I expect core PCE inflation to remain around 1¾ percent over the next several years.  The probable appearance of a small amount of labor market slack is likely to help hold down inflation.  In addition, I expect that, with inflation remaining below 2 percent, inflation expectations will edge down as well, reinforcing our success.  I hope that this result will be aided by the release of our extended forecasts and the greater awareness of where we would like to see inflation settle down.  I see the risk to my inflation forecast as moderate and mainly to the upside in view of recent increases in oil and food prices, declines in the dollar, and a slower rate of structural productivity growth. So, in summary, I think the most likely outcome is that the economy will move forward toward a soft landing.  I see downside risks to economic activity and some upside risks to inflation.  But in view of continuing questions about the effects of the financial market shock, I am more concerned about the activity side of things right now."
"412";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20071031meeting.csv";"  Are we permitted to question?,   Richard, you described vividly the bunch of forces working on headline inflation.  But since you identified yourself as a negative outlier on the inflation forecast, it seems to me your headline forecast is still for significant moderation in headline inflation in ’08.  Am I wrong in that?  At least I infer from this that you’re not showing an acceleration in core PCE inflation.,   I just want to start by saying in defense of the Empire State that there is no way—the only way that Richmond could be bigger than New York and Philadelphia is if you don’t count the substantial business we have in the manufacturing of financial products.,   As the Chairman said at the Economic Club of New York, it is likely to emerge stronger.  I think the outlook looks about the way it did in September. Just a few quick points.  Financial market conditions are substantially better than during the peak of the panic in mid-August; but the improvement, as many of you said, is still quite limited and uneven.  Sentiment is still quite fragile, and I think we still seem likely to face a protracted period of adjustment ahead as the markets work through the substantial array of challenges remaining. Growth in the United States and in the world economy in my view seems likely to slow— more here, of course, than elsewhere.  Here, even though the nonhousing, non-auto parts of the U.S. economy don’t yet show significant evidence of a considerable slowdown of actual or expected demand, I think that still seems likely.  In our central scenario, though, housing construction weakens further.  Housing demand slows further because of the tightening of credit conditions. Prices fall further.  Consumer spending slows a bit, and businesses react by scaling back growth in hiring and investment, and this produces several quarters of growth modestly below trend.  I think that growth outside the United States is likely to slow a bit.  It will slow toward potential, if not all the way to potential, in those economies that have been growing above potential.  Although the world is larger in relative terms and somewhat less vulnerable to a U.S. slowdown than it once was, it seems to me very unlikely that domestic demand in the rest of the world will accelerate as domestic demand slows in the United States.  So the risks to this outlook for U.S. growth still seem to lie to the downside.  The magnitude of the downside risks may be slightly less than in September, but they remain substantial.  I think the main source of this downside risk to growth is the interaction between expectations of recession probability and the credit market dynamics.  Each feeds the other.  As the outlook for housing deteriorates and the recession probability stays elevated, financial institutions and investors stay cautious.  That caution, in turn, slows the pace of recovery in markets—in asset-backed, securitization, and structured-credit markets—and in credit growth more broadly.  As expectations adjust to anticipate a longer, more-substantial period of impairment in markets, then recession probability at least potentially increases. I think that the underlying inflation numbers and the measures we use to capture underlying inflation do not suggest any meaningful acceleration in underlying inflation, and we still expect the core PCE to run at a rate below 2 percent over the forecast period.  In some ways, though, the inflation outlook now feels a bit worse.  It feels worse because of the modest rise in breakevens that we saw following our last meeting and because of sentiment in markets around gold, commodity and energy prices, and the dollar.  The fact that breakevens at long horizons have risen or failed to fall as monetary policy expectations have shifted down is not the most comforting pattern out there. So I think we need to be very careful not to encourage any sense in markets that we’re indifferent to those potential risks.  Having said that, I think the risks to that inflation forecast are roughly balanced. The range of tools we have for measuring equilibrium combined with what you see in financial market expectations suggests that monetary policy, to assess the real short-term interest rate, is at or above most estimates of neutral and, therefore, is still exerting some modest restraint on growth.  The expectations now built into markets imply too much easing over the next eighteen months, more than I think we’re likely to have to do.  But I think the appropriate path of monetary policy lies under the Greenbook’s assumption.  Thank you."

[Coffee break],   Why don’t we recommence.  Vice Chairman.,   Thank you.  Governor Kohn.,   Thank you.  Governor Warsh.,   Thank you.  Governor Kroszner.,   Thank you.  Governor Mishkin.,   Thank you, Governor.  Well, again, thank you for a very helpful discussion.  Let me just try to briefly summarize and then offer a few additional comments. Many participants obviously gave considerable attention to the resurgence of stresses in financial markets, including the increased losses by financial institutions, widening spreads, and poorly functioning markets.  Some expressed concern that these developments were likely to result in tighter credit—not just in mortgages, where conditions are already tight, but in other areas as well— perhaps resulting in spillovers to the broader economy.  A weakening economy could cause financial conditions to worsen further, leading to a negative feedback loop, and indeed, there are signs of some broader credit deterioration.  Impending mortgage rate resets and foreclosures pose further risks.  Some took these developments as increasing downside risk to growth, perhaps significantly.  However, other participants noted some mitigating factors, including the fact that banks came into the situation with a lot of capital.  Some institutions have raised capital.  There’s the possibility that other credit providers could take over from money center banks.  Corporate balance sheets are strong.  The credit problems have a regional focus in some cases, and there is a lack of effect so far on many on Main Street.  Some also noted that the price discovery process was inevitable and needed. With respect to the macroeconomic data, overall the incoming data were slightly weaker than expected, particularly in housing and consumption, although, again, the anecdotes were somewhat mixed.  Fundamentals for consumption are weaker but not collapsing, with the labor market and perhaps wealth still providing some support and mixed information on retail sales. Differences across regions and products were noted.  With the possible exception of commercial real estate in some cases, investment is not yet much affected by credit conditions.  Improvements in inventory management were cited as a positive.  Unemployment remains low, and wage pressures exist in some areas, but they were less cited, I think it’s fair to say, than in past meetings. Export demand related to the weaker dollar and strong foreign growth provides some help to the manufacturing sector, although it was noted that other countries might not be immune to a slowdown in U.S. growth.  Overall, most participants saw slower growth, but there is greater agreement that the outlook is in any case more uncertain. On inflation, some took a relatively benign view noting the restraint from a slowing economy and less tightness in labor markets.  Others noted some recent increases in core inflation and continuing pressures from energy, food, and the dollar.  Many stressed that stable inflation expectations cannot be taken as a given.  Any comments or questions? Let me just add a bit to the discussion because, as usual, it has already been very thorough. Again, if one looks at the incoming macro data, I think a fair judgment is that it was a little weaker than we expected.  The economy has been a little slower than we expected.  Housing data, consumption, and I would argue investment and production numbers were all somewhat lower than we thought was going to be the case at the end of October.  I would also argue that, in particular, the consumer, who of course is crucial to the expansion, is facing somewhat weaker conditions— including higher oil prices, less wealth from lower stock and house prices, and perhaps tighter credit—than was the case a month and a half ago.  I think it is noteworthy that the unexplained portion of consumer sentiment has declined considerably.  There seem to be attitudes or, if you like, forecasts among consumers that are even weaker than would be suggested by some of the conditions they are currently seeing, and I think that is a concern. Now, there have certainly been positive developments in the data.  The labor market has held up pretty well.  The unemployment rate actually dropped a bit last week.  Stocks have come back a bit from their so-called correction, although I should say that this is conditional on a lot of expected easing by the Federal Reserve.  ISM surveys show manufacturing as flat, but manufacturing is still growing, and there was a bit of good news yesterday in housing, with some slight indications of improved pending sales.  I think it’s interesting that the Michigan survey notes that prospective homebuyers are actually a bit upbeat because they see interest rates as low and prices as more favorable.  So, again, the data suggest some weakness, but the story is not entirely unmixed. So how would we interpret this?  I think you could take a more sanguine view that we are seeing the continuation of a zigzag pattern that we’ve seen for quite a while.  We had very weak growth in the first quarter of this year, for example; but even with the zero growth projected for the fourth quarter, we will see 2.2 percent growth in the first half of ’07 and 2.5 percent growth in the second half of ’07.  So it could be that we’re just seeing a zigzag pattern, and some of that is certainly true.  It’s also still true that a lot of the weakness we’re seeing is in the housing sector.  For example, for all of ’07, growth excluding housing is about 3½ percent—so again, not suggestive of great weakness.  Now, all of that being noted, I don’t think I’d go quite as far as Governor Mishkin; I try to maintain an even keel here in my mood.  [Laughter],   But I think I’m in the camp of those who see a fundamental softening going on here.  One indicator is the pattern of final demand.  This zigzag pattern has been mostly in a situation with basically about 2 percent growth in final demand but with quarter-to- quarter variation in exports and inventories.  We see in this case the opposite.  Growth in private domestic final demand is projected by the Greenbook to fall to minus 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter and another minus 0.3 percent in the first quarter of next year.  It does seem to have been a step-down in economic growth outside of housing. The other issue is the financial markets, which so many people have commented on.  I just note that there are several elements to this.  First are the losses and the downgrades that have hit capital.  These have been only partially offset by new capital issuances.  In particular, we’ve seen about $75 billion in write-downs or losses in the financial sector, of which $45 billion has occurred since our last meeting, at a time when we thought things were clearing up.  Criticized loans by our supervisors for the top fifty bank holding companies rose from 26 to 28 percent over the last quarter. So we’re seeing continued losses, and I expect to see that to go forward.  The second element of this is the pressure on balance sheets.  Banks are taking off-balance-sheet assets onto the balance sheet. An example that Governor Kroszner mentioned is the leveraged-loan market, which was open for a while and now seems to be closed, and securitization markets remain closed. Moreover, and I think this is particularly worrisome going forward, supervisors—and you all, of course, talk to your supervisors—are increasingly concerned about credit quality as it looks likely to evolve.  Commercial real estate is one area in which we’ve seen essentially no defaults yet, but these things tend to lag, and there’s a lot of expectation both among bankers and among supervisors of that sector weakening.  One indicator of banks’ views is that they have been raising their loan-loss provisions at a rapid rate, $17 billion in the third quarter.  It was at a twenty-year high, and we are certainly hearing from, for example, the Federal Advisory Council that they expect credit quality to continue to deteriorate.  The result of this is that, although I do not expect insolvency or near insolvency among major financial institutions, they are certainly going to become much more cautious, and I think that will affect their lending behavior and their willingness to extend new credit.  As has been pointed out, some of the natural substitutes like the so-called shadow banking system are not really there at this point, and I would also be less sanguine than some about regional and community banks, which face their own problems:  lack of securitization outlets and a lot of exposure to commercial real estate. So I do think that we’re going to see some tightening of credit and that it could get worse. Experience suggests that, while financial conditions are always different and the financial structure has changed significantly, credit crunches can have a big effect on the economy.  The case that’s been cited the most is the 1991-92 crunch, when the capital losses were pretty limited regionally but, nevertheless, there was a national impact.  Another smaller, perhaps less relevant, example is the Carter credit controls in March 1980, which were very small in their aspiration yet somehow managed to create a short recession.  So I believe that the financial conditions are going to be a significant drag.  It is going to go on for a while.  Given the low growth expectations, it could lead us into a negative growth area.  I see realistically only one way in which we could avoid a drag from the financial system, which would be if, in fact, we get lucky and the housing market begins to stabilize and there’s a sense that we’ve reached bottom there and house prices are stabilizing.  I think that would do a tremendous amount of good for the financial system.  It might lead to sufficient improvement as to avoid some of these consequences. You know, I do think that we have to take note of the fact that the two-year government yield is down about 75 basis points in real terms since our last meeting and that five-year bond yields are down about 60 basis points in real terms.  That’s certainly a market view on what’s happening to growth expectations, and it’s not terribly inconsistent with some of the figures that come out of the Greenbook calculations.  So obviously there are mixed views, but I think it is very hard to argue that both the modal growth forecast and the rest of that output forecast have not shifted adversely. With respect to inflation—again, people made these points as well—it is unfortunate that we do have some instability, some risks there.  We saw some stabilization of the dollar over the past six weeks.  That is obviously not exogenous.  It depends on our behavior and our communication.  I think oil prices depend also to some extent on our policy, directly or indirectly.  We will be seeing some ugly near-term inflation numbers with oil price increases, which we hope will move out of the data shortly, but we’re not sure.  So obviously we have to watch that.  I think there are a few things that are slightly helpful on that front.  One is that, relative to the previous intermeeting period, there’s more conviction now that other countries may be easing monetary policy.  In fact, we’ve seen cuts in Canada and the United Kingdom.  I think that takes a bit of the risk away from the dollar. I do not know how big the impact of the national intelligence estimate about Iran will be, but it certainly reduces a bit the geopolitical risk that has been around oil over the past couple of years. But, of course, I agree with Governor Mishkin and many others that, whatever we might be tempted to do in terms of trying to get ahead of the financial conditions and what I fully believe will be ultimately a Main Street problem as well as a Wall Street problem, we need to be highly cognizant—this is not a ritual but an honest statement—of those implications for inflation expectations and the dollar as well.  So let me stop there, just adding that I think the situation is very difficult and we need to recognize the uncertainty that we’re facing.  I believe that in response we will have to make sure that we are sufficiently flexible, open minded, willing to accept new evidence and new information, and willing to respond actively and quickly when we do get that new information.  Let me stop there, and let me now ask for volunteers—oh, sorry—before we do that, Brian will introduce the policy go-round."
"414";"MR. EVANS.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Coming out of our October meeting, I expected a period of subpar growth stretching into the middle of 2008.  Since I was anticipating some soft data, it was not obvious to me that the outlook had worsened until later in the intermeeting period.  A lot of the data that we have cited are financial items that are difficult to assess and are somewhat unusual for the current period.  But the incoming information has caused us to mark down our outlook further, although we don’t see growth declining as far below potential as in the Greenbook baseline forecast.  Although housing continues to weaken, that by itself did not cause a substantial revision to our outlook.  The bigger factor was a noticeable weakening of consumption.  PCE was basically flat in September and October—I guess dead on arrival.  The financial headlines are taking their toll on consumer sentiment, and higher energy prices are lowering real incomes. It is not clear, however, that we are seeing a major sustained pullback in consumption; but, of course, that is arguable.  The limited information we have about November—motor vehicle sales and the chain store data—suggest at least modest gains in consumer expenditures.  I realize that the chain store sales could be a bit artificial.  I was talking to one of my business contacts who has a significant presence in retail, and I am accustomed to hearing that, “Well, the Christmas season is a bit short this year, so that could be a problem.”  But I actually caught him this time saying, “Gee, it’s so long this time that people seem to be losing interest.”  [Laughter] On balance, I think the fundamentals for consumption are still reasonably good. Importantly, although they may be somewhat lagging, the payroll numbers are still consistent with decent growth in wage income, and the unemployment rate remains low. Elsewhere, foreign growth remains good, which along with the lower dollar should support continued growth in exports.  We have seen some softening in capital spending as well, but the usual indicators still point to moderate gains in investment.  These developments seem reasonably consistent with what I heard from business contacts.  Most of them think that growth is slowing, and they are more cautious, but I would summarize their views as guarded and not alarmist.  Furthermore, many say that their improved inventory control methods are preventing an inventory cycle from exacerbating the current situation, and they bring this up without my prompting.  So to me their comments do not yet suggest a sharp curtailment in real economic activity. Of course, the financial markets continue to weigh negatively on the outlook.  In my view, the biggest concerns are the large markdowns on structured securities and the volume of assets that may be returning to banks’ balance sheets.  These effects appear to be larger than the banks had planned for as of October and could have a significant impact on lending capacity. This is an important downside risk to the real economy, as the Greenbook highlights in many places.  That said, when I talk with my business contacts, there continues to be a disconnect between the credit conditions they report facing and the turbulence we see in money and credit markets.  Outside of lending for residential and nonresidential construction, my CEO contacts at nonfinancial firms do not report much change in credit costs or availability.  We have heard this from a number of sources.  For example, two of the larger banks in our District said they have not changed terms to borrowers, and they expressed relatively sanguine views of lending conditions overall.  For the time being, some lenders report offsetting a portion of their higher funding costs by taking a hit on their interest margins. Credit conditions for construction-related industries are another matter.  A major shopping center developer who has been one of the largest issuers of commercial mortgage- backed securities indicated that this market has dried up completely.  However, the developer has been able to obtain financing from other traditional sources, such as life insurance companies. He is paying similar interest rates, he says, but the terms include lower loan-to-value ratios.  So there is some credit effect, but he still has access for the moment.  That is a bit like what President Lacker was suggesting.  He said the switch is not a big deal for him currently, but if it continues for too long—say, for more than six months or so—it would then weigh more heavily on his business activity.  The evolution of such developments will obviously be an important thing to watch over the next few meetings.  I would just note that I don’t often look at the Duke University survey of CFOs.  But as I looked at it—and I don’t have a great deal of experience— it did seem to indicate that they had higher spending plans on average from their September survey for capital expenditures and technology spending.  It wasn’t a great bit, but given all the negative headlines associated with the credit conditions—which are unweighted, whereas these spending plans are weighted—that was a bit of a surprise. Putting all of this together, we have marked down our current quarter and 2008 real GDP forecasts 0.4 percentage point, which is pretty significant.  We now have growth next year of 2¼ percent.  We expect growth to improve to our assessment of potential thereafter, namely about 2½ percent.  This forecast assumes two policy easings, similar to but sooner than the Greenbook, and it is shaded toward the “stronger domestic demand” alternative scenario, which has less financial restraint on PCE and business fixed investment than in the Greenbook baseline. Turning to inflation, our forecast is for PCE inflation to settle in at 1.8 percent.  This continued favorable projection for inflation is important for my policy views now.  We think resource utilization likely will be about neutral for inflation over this forecast period.  Our GDP projection does not result in appreciable resource slack over the forecast period.  Even under the weaker Greenbook scenario, the GDP gap remains less than ½ percentage point.  But there are upside risks.  The most recent data on core prices have been a bit higher.  The lower dollar could put pressure on prices, and my business contacts remain concerned about the cost of energy and other commodities.  Finally, at least by the Board staff calculations, five-year forward TIPS inflation compensation has moved up to the range that it was in during the spring of 2006, a period when we were more concerned about the inflation outlook.  I wouldn’t put too much weight on this particular inflation expectation development at the moment, but it may be looming ahead.  So I continue to see upside risk to inflation, which if realized would complicate our policy reaction to developments on the growth and employment side of the ledger.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

FISHER.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Well, Mr. Chairman, having listened to various views starting with President Yellen, on the one end, and President Plosser, on the other, and President Hoenig on inflation, I was thinking that Edward R. Murrow said that anybody who isn’t confused really doesn’t understand the situation.  [Laughter]  I’m confused, and I don’t understand the situation.  I would like to report what I see, however.  First, in terms of my District—in sharp contrast to the Twelfth District, because I think they are two extremes, or, say, Florida, in President Lockhart’s District— employment growth has slowed.  I mention this because last time I mentioned a data point, which is that within our District—actually in one state—year to date we may have created up to one-fifth of the jobs in this country.  We were growing our employment base at 3.9 percent in the first quarter. We expected it to slow to 3.1 in the third quarter and then to slow down to the high 2s as we approached the end of the year.  Housing prices in our District are appreciating, and we’re benefiting from what we call the California diaspora—that is, particularly the techies and others, who are pushing up prices in Dallas and Austin.  Finally, one point to bear in mind is wage pressure. Oil and gas extraction represents only 2 percent of the employment of Texas, despite how everybody stereotypes our state.  Yet the wage index in that industry and the labor shortage are putting enormous pressure on skilled labor in other areas, and the overall wage index for our District is rising at the highest rate since January.  Unemployment is down to 4.1 percent for our District. So like President Plosser, we are enjoying a relatively strong situation. However, my views on policy are not governed by the outlier District that I inhabit, and I’d like just to give some anecdotal evidence, for what it is worth, since most of the information I was going to impart has been given by other thoughtful people at this table.  First of all, on the growth side, my conversations with the CEO of MasterCard were quite detailed this month because I was following up on what I was hearing from retailers at different price points.  He said that retail sales through November were up 6 percent year over year; taking out gasoline, 4 percent.  He reported that most banks are expressing some concern about receivables growth in California, Florida, Nevada, and Arizona.  But elsewhere and at the largest issuers, as he put it, he does not see consumers running up their lines.  I think this is in keeping with chart 4, the middle panel, in the Bluebook, which shows consumer credit fairly steady as you go through time and not significantly increasing.  Second, the CEO of Wal-Mart USA—since you didn’t mention Wal-Mart—feels a shift in view in that consumers, as he said with a terrible pun, have driven through $3.00 gas—that is, they accept $3.00 gas.  The CEO of JCPenney, who reported before our last meeting that he felt that “the wheels were coming off the economy,” has sales 10 percent year over year to date through last Monday.  As to Black Friday, yes, there was discounting on Black Friday.  For JCPenney, their total volume was up almost 30 percent over their previous record year, and there is a sense in the retail industry that there may be a calming down between the two periods—the prolonged shopping period that you mentioned.  Nonetheless, most of the retailers I speak to at different price points on the gross side are happier than they expected to be.  Another phenomenon that seems to be occurring is an increase in confidence with regard to inventory management.  That was best expressed by the CEO of Texas Instruments, who reported that, when we last met and actually during the summer, there was almost a freeze in terms of the willingness to build inventory and that their customers were not willing to think beyond thirty days.  Now, having looked through the clouds that are presented on the financial front, which I’ll address very briefly in a second, they see more willingness for ninety-day commitments. On almost every other front, with the exception of the homebuilders, I haven’t heard from my CEO contacts the negativism that, again, is reflected on the Wall Street side of the equation, with three exceptions.  In terms of the airline industry, Southwest Airlines’ overall volume is down 3.6 percent in the third quarter.  It’s pretty uniform across all Districts, including my own.  We talked about trucks earlier.  One of my contacts is the largest truck dealer in the country.  He estimates according to what he calls, if you’ll forgive the expression, SWAG—which is “sophisticated, wild-assed guess.”  I ask for the transcript to put the third letter in the third word as in a snake rather than the posterior.  [Laughter]  But the estimate of Class A truck sales, whether they’re going to Russia or not, was 350,000 in ’07.  The original forecast for ’08 was 280,000, and they now estimate 200,000.  So there is a significant slackening on that front. Finally, with regard to the housing market, you obviously don’t want to talk to anybody in the homebuilding industry currently.  But those with the strong balance sheets are taking advantage of weaknesses in certain areas, and I’ll give you one data point that was startling.  In the Sacramento, California, area, one of the large house builders just bought a fully developed set of lots that were priced at $175,000 a lot and the going price was $35,000 a lot.  Significant deflation clearly is occurring in that sector—but also significant opportunity. I’d like to address the inflation situation more thoroughly, Mr. Chairman.  The CEO of Wal-Mart USA said that, for the first time in his career at that firm, they have approved a plan in which purchase costs will increase 3 percent in ’08.  He hadn’t seen that before in his experience and said, “I’m totally used to deflation.  Deflation is finished.”  In terms of the suppliers to Wal-Mart, this was verified.  I think on food prices we have to be extremely careful.  Frito-Lay is seeking a 5½ percent price increase for next year.  Wal-Mart has acquiesced.  According to the CFO of that company, that’s the highest rate in fifteen years.  Kimberly-Clark and other paper producers, as I reported before, pushed through price increases.  Procter & Gamble and others have followed. In terms of the energy situation—whether it is, as I mentioned before, Exxon or the large independents—they don’t see much price relief other than what is the variable factor presented by the so-called city refiners. Our own data at the Dallas Federal Reserve indicate on the international side that there has been some slackening as indicated in the Bluebook, but our work with JPMorgan and the index we’re developing indicate that capacity remains very tight and that the tight capacity has added to fuel and food prices and may well explain why inflation in the euro zone, the United Kingdom, Japan, and other areas, including Canada, is higher than the benign trends they’ve been experiencing or are targeting in countries like Mexico.  So on net, Mr. Chairman, from our perspective, I can’t say I much agree with the Greenbook because I have different views about business investment— I’m hearing reports of significant cap-ex expansion—and, on the inflation front, I believe that we are understating inflationary pressures. Now, very quickly on the comment that was made about conditions in financial markets having worsened:  We hear this repeatedly.  President Plosser mentioned price discovery.  I think we have to be very, very careful to not overreact to what we see developing on Wall Street and to realize that there are benefits to price discovery.  It is because of that price discovery that we’re seeing a substitution effect, which I referenced in my questions earlier.  It may be equity for debt, but it is restoring balance sheets, and reasonable prices obtain.  I would argue that it is a healthier condition than, as I said earlier, living in the fantasy world where we were pricing things at ridiculous levels rather than realistic levels. We’ll come to the policy discussion shortly, but I would like to ask when we have that discussion what we are really buying with a fed funds rate cut—given the other mechanism that we’re going to be putting forward and, very, very important, remembering as President Hoenig, President Plosser, and others have mentioned that we still have significant price pressures baked into the cake.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"416";"MR. HOENIG.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll start on the local level.  Overall our District economy continues to perform generally well, with ongoing weakness in the housing sector being offset by strength in agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.  We have seen some slowing in employment growth over the past few months, but this appears in part to be a supply consideration. Our directors and business contacts continue to report that the labor markets are, in fact, tight across much of the District with shortages of both skilled and unskilled labor and rising wage pressures. There is some reduction in employment, obviously in the housing sector, but that is being offset by these other considerations.  I would also note that manufacturing activity remains basically solid, with manufacturers reporting strong export orders.  The District’s manufacturing index moved upward in November and still points to moderate growth.  In addition, District manufacturers’ capital spending plans actually rose but remained below most of last year’s readings on balance. Turning to spending, general retailers reported a rebound in sales in the latter part of October and early November.  Automobile dealers, on the other hand, did report weaker sales and have also become more pessimistic on future sales.  Travel and tourism continues to expand in our region, with District airline traffic figures solid, particularly in the Denver area.  Likewise, hotel occupancy figures have continued to increase from already strong levels in the region.  As has been true for some time, housing activity, as I said, remains soft.  For example, the value of residential contracts dropped again in October, and the rate of decline in residential permits steepened again in the past few months in our region.  Offsetting this weakness in housing, though, is considerable strength in agriculture and energy.  District energy producers continue to expand their capital investments as they are relatively confident that oil and gas prices will remain firm over the longer term.  In fact, their capital expenditures have been slowed by a continuing shortage of labor and access to some equipment.  Our larger regional banks are still reporting fairly good conditions.  The deal flows seem to be coming through, although they are looking at those carefully, just given the environment that they find themselves in on a national level.  Finally, price pressures remain mixed. Most businesses report rising input costs, both labor and materials, but differ in their ability to pass those costs on at this point.  In transportation, input costs are passed through one for one through customer surcharges.  Other businesses continue to find it a little more difficult to pass through the higher costs, but they are beginning to push harder on that as we talk to them. Let me turn to the national outlook.  Weakness in incoming data and continuing stress in financial markets obviously are noteworthy, and others have noted that here today.  Compared with the Greenbook, however, I see stronger growth in both the short run and the longer run.  I expect fourth-quarter growth to be closer to 1 percent, not the zero percent in the Greenbook, and the economy to strengthen slowly through a good part of 2008, starting out slowly obviously and then picking up as we go through the year.  Comparing my views with those in Greenbook, the basic difference appears to be largely in some of the judgmental adjustments in the Greenbook concerning spillovers from the housing and financial stress to consumer spending.  The current Greenbook forecast, as others have noted, is similar to the Blue Chip Bottom Ten forecast, which suggests to me that it might be better seen as the downside risk outlook not necessarily the most likely outlook at this point.  The first half of 2008, as I said, is likely to be somewhat slower than I previously projected because of the high energy prices and continued drag from housing.  However, I expect that growth will gradually strengthen as we move toward the end of 2008 and then remain there through the rest of the forecast period.  Having said this, I realize that the downside risk to economic activity does remain elevated.  The housing slowdown could be deeper and last longer, and continuing financial turmoil could further affect consumer and business spending.  However, while financial factors remain a risk to the outlook, in my view the economy, though it will grow below its potential, can weather these forces and is being supported by the policy actions that we have taken in the past two meetings. Against this outlook for economic growth, let me turn now to the inflation outlook.  Year- over-year overall and core inflation rates have risen.  In addition, Greenbook’s 2008 forecast for overall and core PCE inflation has increased since our last meeting.  While below-trend growth in the near term may exert some downward pressure on inflation, the combination of higher prices for oil, commodities, and some services and dollar depreciation should place upward pressure on both overall and core inflation going forward.  Over the past several years, the pass-through of dollar depreciation and higher oil prices to inflation has been limited in part because of longer-term inflation expectations remaining, as we said, anchored.  My concern is that, if we continue to lower the fed funds rate into a rising inflation environment and the dollar continues to depreciate, these expectations may become unhinged perhaps more quickly than we would like to think.  In this environment, I think we should not lose sight of not just the downside risk to the real economy but also some very serious upside risk to inflation.  Thank you."
"417";"MR. KOHN.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The outlook for economic activity has weakened over the intermeeting period.  The housing bust looks steeper with importantly greater declines in prices, and that will affect future consumption.  Weakness in housing and the uncovering of greater losses at key financial intermediaries have contributed to a notable deterioration in financial markets and a tightening of some financial conditions.  We are also beginning to see signs that economic weakness has not been confined to the housing-related sectors.  With regard to activity outside of housing, like many others who have spoken today, I see the most notable development as the flattening-out of consumption spending in September and October.  That could reflect the rise in energy prices, but it seems to me that the very deep dip in consumer sentiment suggests that more is at work—that the actual and expected effects of financial market turmoil, for example, on the cost and availability of credit to households along with lower house and stock prices might also be contributing to less-ebullient consumption spending in the recent past and going forward. Capital spending also seems to be slowing.  Although business investment spending hasn’t been revised down in the fourth quarter in the Greenbook, logically slower consumption growth will show through before long, as it does beginning in the first quarter in the Greenbook.  In addition, we have some more evidence of greater business caution, which could damp business investment relative to expected activity.  The NFIB survey for November, for example, shows that the outlook by small businesses deteriorated decidedly in November.  There’s a sharp downturn in almost all the outlook indexes for small businesses in this November survey; and as I listen to the reports from around the table, I think for all except a swath of states from Nebraska through Texas, maybe the lower Midwest, I’m hearing a little more pessimism from other places around the country consistent with this.  To be sure, employment continues to expand.  Various purchasing manager surveys also suggest that activity continues to increase, albeit slowly.  But I agree with the staff that, on balance, the incoming data suggest more near-term weakness than anticipated at our last meeting, including some tentative evidence of spillovers from housing. Financial market conditions have deteriorated substantially, and that will place further restraint on growth next year.  I think what we learned in the first few weeks of November was that losses are much larger than had been previously anticipated.  Those losses stretched into what had been seen as higher quality mortgage-related assets, as Bill Dudley showed us, and the losses are large enough to call into question the ability of some very essential intermediaries to provide support for markets or to extend much additional credit.  Those intermediaries include Fannie and Freddie and the financial guarantors, as well as some investment and commercial banks. As concerns about downgrades and potential fire sales rose, investors and institutions moved to protect themselves, with the rise in term funding spreads symptomatic of the greater level of concern.  It is logical and reasonable that the response of intermediaries to this concern would be to tighten terms and conditions for their loans to exert greater control over their balance sheets. Expectations that intermediaries will be tightening credit, along with the incoming spending data, led to a more pessimistic view of the economic outlook, and although Treasury rates fell substantially, concern about the performance of borrowers meant that those declines did not show through very much into the cost of funds to private lenders and borrowers.  Indeed, a number of indicators point to a net tightening of credit conditions across a range of borrowing sources over the intermeeting period, and that tightening will persist past the New Year.  That tightening will have adverse implications for demand by households and businesses in 2008—that is, I do think there’s going to be some spillover from Wall Street to Main Street.  Forward measures of the LIBOR-OIS spread for after the year-end moved substantially higher.  In effect, the cost to banks of funding will not reflect the full extent of the easing we’ve done in the federal funds market.  The spreads on corporate bonds have widened sufficiently to actually increase borrowing costs for both investment- grade and junk-bond issuers over the intermeeting period.  The leveraged-loan market deteriorated in late November, forcing banks to take more loans onto their balance sheets, using up scarce balance sheet room.  Secondary markets for nonconforming mortgages remain moribund, with no signs of life, and any loans that will be made in these nonconforming sectors will be placed onto the balance sheets of thrifts and banks, many of which are already facing strains.  Perhaps as a consequence, rates on prime jumbo mortgages have actually risen over the intermeeting period; Fannie and Freddie have increased fees and are tightening standards, and they face slightly higher spreads.  So the damping effect of lower Treasury rates on the cost of conforming housing credit will be held down. All that said, I do see some encouraging signs that the preconditions for future improvements are coming into place.  As others have noted specifically, institutions are recognizing and dealing more directly with the implications of these losses.  They are recognizing the losses more aggressively.  They’re raising capital, and they’re being more explicit about taking contingent liabilities like SIVs onto their balance sheets.  Even so, I think that what we have learned over the intermeeting period is that the process of returning financial markets to more normal functioning is going to take longer and the disruption to the cost and availability of credit will be greater than I had thought just six weeks ago. Prospects for a period of weaker economic growth and reduced resource utilization do work to lower inflation risks.  In addition, we’ve seen a downward revision to compensation and unit labor costs, and commodity prices outside food and energy have fallen substantially in recent weeks.  At the same time, energy prices have risen, and past inflation data have been revised higher, and the staff has actually revised up its inflation forecast by a tenth or two over the next few years. So on balance, I judge the inflation risk still to be to the upside if the economy follows the modal forecast but by considerably less than I thought at the last meeting.  I look forward to a discussion in the next part of the meeting about how we deal with the policy implications of this changing situation."
"418";"MR. KROSZNER.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  At the last meeting I expected a somewhat rougher patch, particularly in housing, than the last Greenbook scenario—a sort of slow-burn scenario, or something that Dave made reference to.  But over just the past three weeks or so, the heat of that fire has become a lot greater than I had expected in terms of the burn that I’m seeing in the financial markets as well as in the real markets, particularly with respect to consumption, as many people have mentioned, and then more broadly just the reclosing of markets that had opened up.  I described some of the markets and the turmoil, saying that things were in sort of a brittle circumstance.  Unfortunately, I think in certain parts we’re starting to see some cracks show. I want to focus on thinking about banks’ balance sheets and how that addresses some of the issues that we’ve talked about.  For commercial and industrial lending, as many people said, there still seems to be reasonable robustness in the investment-grade corporate sector.  Those guys haven’t yet seen a lot of pressures in terms of increased cost of funding—not a reduced cost of funding but also not an increased cost of funding—just a slight increase in terms; but it’s no problem for them to deal with those kinds of terms.  They have the markets open to them both for long-term debt issuance and for intermediate-term debt issuance.  They have bank funding that is available.  Most of the banks, the large banks as well as smaller banks, are suggesting that, although they may be tightening standards somewhat, there is still a reasonable amount of credit demand and that most boards and executives are saying “continue to make those loans.”  Firms’ balance sheets are still quite strong.  Firms have built up a lot of cash or liquid assets on their balance sheets over the past few years of profitability, so that part hasn’t seen that much of a challenge.  Some of the increases that we’ve seen and measured on the books of banks in terms of their C&I portfolios are the taking on board of some leveraged loans on which they had made commitments a number of months ago; those commitments are now being drawn down, and so they’re increasing their portfolios.  So some of the increase in C&I lending is really just commitments that have come in earlier.  The leveraged-lending market, which had opened up for syndication, has quite affirmatively closed once again.  That’s clearly a negative development. With respect to SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, it seems that many of the banks are going it alone without waiting for the M-LEC.  Virtually all major banks have announced programs for bringing asset-backed commercial paper or SIVs onto their balance sheets.  So this is still orderly, but it’s beginning to show some stress on the balance sheets with the leveraged lending and all of the SIVs coming on board, and this underscores the importance that a number of people mentioned about capital-raising efforts and ensuring that capital will be available, not just above the regulatory minimums but enough to make the market certifiers, the rating agencies, and others continue to feel comfortable. A number of people have also mentioned that the flattening, and in some cases the downturn, in commercial real estate and the tightening of terms are of particular concern at the midsized and smaller banks.  As you know, we had issued some guidelines a little more than a year ago on commercial real estate concentration and concerns about that because we had looked back to what happened during the savings and loan crisis and saw that we were starting to get banks into the same levels of concentration that we had seen back then that were associated with troubles. Although we had a lot of negative pushback at that time, I think that was not an unreasonable thing to do, but there are still a lot of challenges at those institutions. Consumer lending is probably the area in which I’ve seen the greatest change, and it has raised my concerns the most.  I’ll hold off on mortgages for a moment.  First, I talked with a very large provider of credit cards and other consumer products, HELOCs, mortgages, et cetera, who said that, since the report that I received just before the last FOMC meeting, when things were reasonably stable, they had seen significant deterioration.  As some people have said, even though it has gone up sharply, the numbers are still reasonable, but it’s the delta that concerns me, the very sharp deterioration that they’re seeing.  They’re seeing this nationwide.  The sharpest deterioration is, as a number of people have said, in the areas that have seen the greatest housing-price stress— California, Nevada, and Florida—but it’s not limited to those.  I won’t go through all the details of what they told me on delinquency rates on different types of products, but nationwide they are seeing doubling, tripling, or quadrupling in those areas, and this is over a period of just six to eight weeks.  So that’s really quite significant and concerns me in combination with some of the lower numbers that we’re seeing with respect to consumption. Also, one of the phrases that they use is that they’re now seeing “contagion in their book.” So it’s not just in one particular area but through a series of consumer products, and it’s not just for subprime borrowers.  They noted that one-third of the charge-offs had a credit score of over 700 at the origination of the mortgage.  So it’s far beyond just the subprime area.  Obviously, as a number of people have said, the mortgage markets have really not reopened.  There had been some hope around the last meeting that the jumbo market would reopen.  We’re seeing no evidence of that. The subprime market is not really open.  The ABX indexes and other indexes are suggesting that markets are anticipating extremely high loss rates, even beyond what Bill was suggesting with the 15 percent loss.  Now, I don’t know whether those are reflecting just loss rates or whether other issues with respect to a lack of liquidity in the markets, or hedging that is going on, but still it’s a concern.  As I mentioned last time, the Case-Shiller S&P index, although extremely thinly traded when you go out a year or two, is still suggesting potentially a 20 percent decline on average in the ten cities that they look at.  So nothing has improved there, and given the tightness in the markets, given that we know that there will be more resets coming, given the continuing pressures, there’s probably going to be a lot more downside potential for housing prices, and that, of course, could again feed into lower consumer spending.  So that’s the concern on the real side. The concern on the financial side is that, obviously, all these things put a lot of pressure on bank balance sheets.  Gathering capital is very important, but basically what we’re seeing is a very, very slow revival of the markets, and I agree with many of the others who have said that it’s going to take a while.  A lot more information, model building, and hiring of people who can analyze these things will be needed.  Something that was disheartening to me is that the Mortgage Bankers Association said that they hope by early next year to be able to provide sufficient information to the market so that people can really assess on a loan-by-loan basis what’s in their CDOs, and that’s a real concern.  The information is simply not out there.  So it’s not just confidence or concerns. People are now looking carefully and saying, “I just don’t have the information to be able to make an assessment.”  That’s, of course, on top of the macroeconomic risk and uncertainty about housing prices in general.  So I do think it’s going to take a while for these markets to revive.  As the Vice Chairman—actually both Vice Chairmen—and others mentioned, if you look into the forward markets for the OIS spread and other things, this is going to persist.  This is not just an end-of-the- year problem. People are looking to the banks for re-intermediation and for taking a lot of things on the balance sheets.  That’s going to continue to put a lot of pressure on the capital that they have, and I think there will be continuing uncertainty for both U.S. institutions and international institutions that things have to keep coming on their books and they won’t be able to get other things off their books. So that is a real challenge going forward. Just a moment on inflation.  I certainly am heartened, as many other people have said, that as expectations about our policy moves have changed, we haven’t seen a significant uptick in inflation expectations, although by some survey measures we have seen some upticks.  But real inflationary pressures are out there, and each incremental step we take with respect to policy easing potentially has higher and higher costs with respect to inflation.  There are no free lunches here, but we do have to be mindful of the downside risk, particularly with respect to the banking and the financial system.  Thank you.,   I believe David and his fellows can provide you with some pills. [Laughter]"
"419";"MR. LACKER.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to be generally sound but with some notable areas of weakness.  Our survey readings on the services firms indicate continued moderate growth in November, and our index of manufacturing activity gained a few points following a sharp decline in October, though it remains in neutral territory.  A number of our contacts reported that the weaker dollar is providing a boost to manufacturing exports, and I have noticed a definite increase in the number of coal trains rumbling by my office on their way from West Virginia to port.  On the other hand, our merchant contacts were much less optimistic about their sales prospects going into the holiday season.  Our retail sales survey indicator slid another 8 points, pulled down by significant declines in big ticket sales and shopper traffic components.  District housing markets continue to weaken overall, with distinctly more-pessimistic tones in some markets, particularly around the D.C. area, although there are a couple of areas that are still reporting decent activity to the south. In commercial real estate, reports from the retail and industrial markets are generally upbeat.  One former director, whose firm owns a sizable portfolio of retail properties throughout the East Coast, described the sector as in the best shape he has seen in his lifetime, and he is by no means a young man.  Industrial leasing appears to be in good shape, even tight in some markets.  In the office market, however, contacts in Maryland and the Carolinas report slower office leasing activity in October and early November. The community bankers I have talked with say that portfolios are still quite clean but that they are scrutinizing deals much more carefully in the current environment.  They also complain that large banks are raising deposit rates and competing more intensely for deposits.  At large banks, the cost of capital has increased, and they are responding accordingly by reevaluating the profitability of various lines of business.  This does not appear to have resulted in any wholesale cutback in lending but more in a tightening of terms in selected market segments. I view the information from our District as fairly consistent with my economic outlook at the national level.  Housing investment continues to contract, and the overhang of unsold homes and general tightening of credit terms suggest a quite prolonged period of relatively depressed activity.  Consumer spending clearly has slowed.  For the months of September and October, real consumption showed almost no growth.  While early reports on the holiday shopping season are notoriously slippery, it seems clear that shoppers are far from ebullient, perhaps with the exception of these GPS toys.  This seems consistent with the virtual absence of growth in real disposable income over the past two months and the flattening-out of household net worth in the third quarter.  Job growth has shifted down to a more modest pace over this year, and revisions to the payroll series, when we finally get them, seem likely to make the slowdown look bigger.  So it wouldn’t surprise me if consumer spending came in fairly tame next year.  I am expecting a slowdown in consumer spending growth, however, not a sharp pullback.  Labor markets are still fairly tight.  Household net worth is still at fairly elevated levels.  So while the increase in the saving rate projected by the Greenbook for next year is plausible, I think consumer spending could come out on the high side of that forecast. A key factor in the outlook and a key source of uncertainty is the continuing drama in credit markets.  Large banks are bringing impaired assets onto their balance sheets and are facing a higher cost of capital and increased funding costs.  It would seem reasonable to expect them to respond by tightening terms of credit for households and business borrowers, implying a further drag on spending.  The magnitude of this sort of fallout is still quite uncertain.  Reduced credit flows appear so far to be less a reduction in credit supply than in demand.  That is, they appear to reflect a genuine deterioration in borrower creditworthiness in some segments.  Residential real estate fits this description as does some, though not all, commercial real estate.  Beyond these sectors, we have seen some evidence of yield spreads widening, but the cost of credit to investment-grade nonfinancial firms is low and has been falling along with the risk-free rate, at least until very recently.  The flow of credit to such firms seems to have been holding up well, as has the nonmortgage consumer credit flow.  So at this point, it does not look as though an indiscriminate, across-the-board credit crunch is taking place, although marginally higher credit costs may exert some additional drag on spending growth.  Overall, then, I do see a weaker outlook for growth in the near term, and the timing of the return to trend is going to depend somewhat on the bottoming-out of the housing cycle, which unfortunately appears to be getting even more remote each time we meet. If we have a more protracted slowdown ahead of us, as seems likely now, we need to be careful not to lose sight of inflation.  Core PCE inflation has edged up over the past two months, and it now appears likely to move above 2 percent for a time.  Overall inflation, of course, has been higher on average over the last year, and we have seen a slight upward trend in five-year- forward inflation compensation since earlier in the year.  In fact, the behavior of energy and food prices over the past several years calls into question the standard presumption we make that overall inflation is going to return to the core inflation trend in a reasonable period of time.  That points to the possibility that inflation may give us more trouble ahead."
"420";"MR. LOCKHART.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think President Stern framed it well in bringing focus to the effect on our thinking that the financial markets are having.  As many have said, the central question is not whether the economy is softening but whether it is softening beyond the range that underpinned the policy decision in October.  I’d add to that a range of questions related to financial markets, particularly the question of whether the deterioration in the financial markets changes the prospects for achieving financial stability, the potential for spreading to a wider array of financial markets and institutions, the potential for spillover to the general economy, and the compounding of the already heightened degree of uncertainty.  All of these weigh heavily on my thinking.  Like the Greenbook projections, Atlanta’s forecast has been revised down as a result of incoming data since the last meeting.  I just point out, speaking only for ourselves, that these downward revisions of previous forecasts and our general outlook have been a pattern over recent months. The current situation is extremely difficult to read—which is another way of saying that uncertainty around our forecast has increased yet again.  Contributing to this uncertainty is the continuing, if not accelerating, gap between the anecdotal information and the views I’ve received from Wall Street versus Main Street.  The expectations of financial market participants have deteriorated and can be characterized as extremely serious.  However, the message I get from directors and representatives of nonfinancial businesses outside the housing sector, though relatively pessimistic, has not changed substantially since our October meeting.  In my conversations with financial market contacts, to varying degrees I heard the persistent and growing apprehension concerning the spread of turmoil to an expanding set of affected markets and institutions and a wondering of what will be the next shoe to drop.  One consistent message is the belief that the recent volatility and increase in term spreads cannot be entirely explained by the year-end problem. Most of my contacts agreed that year-end balance sheet concerns are adding to market stress, but no one expressed confidence that getting past year-end will bring much reduction of concerns over counterparty weakness, asset values, and secondary market liquidity.  Most expect financial market turmoil to be protracted, with increasing risk to the general economy.  Almost all my contacts noted that deteriorating housing values are a root cause, feeding problems in the markets.  This view holds that the adjustment in prices and inventory required to stabilize the housing sector will take many months to play out, and until that occurs, the value of structured financial instruments and the solvency and liquidity of structured investment vehicles will be uncertain.  There remains a great deal of skepticism that arrangements like the super SIV and the Treasury’s rate freeze plan will have much tangible effect.  The issue of SIV restructuring and support by sponsors is a growing focus of concern because of their linkage to money market funds as well as their contribution to a general contraction of credit availability.  In sum, my contacts in the financial industry uniformly express the belief that things will not get better any time soon and may well get worse.  While recognizing that a rate reduction does not directly address the information problems in the markets, there is widespread sentiment that lower costs of funds will help. Turning to the anecdotal inputs from contacts in my District, there is some divergence of views between contacts directly affected by the housing sector, including bankers, and others.  Bank loan activity remains particularly weak in real estate segments.  Trucking, large retailers, auto dealerships, and businesses supplying building materials and household durables were identified as segments where loan volumes are slipping.  Industrial warehouse markets have weakened in some metro areas as subcontractors have exited.  Bankers also expect that consumer credit exposures in credit cards, auto loans, prime mortgages, and HELOCs will see a combination of credit deterioration and demand contraction in 2008.  The anecdotal messages from other contacts are less dire.  We took great care in our information-gathering this round to probe hiring expectations, investment plans, and credit availability conditions.  Though credit conditions do seem to have tightened, we still are not hearing that they are preventing planned spending.  Spending and hiring plans remain on the weak side, but no more so than was the case at our October meeting. Consistent with the Greenbook projection for exports, we heard that spending from abroad, including international tourism and condo-purchase activity, continues relatively strong.  At the branch board meeting in Miami, I heard that Russians are the latest foreign buyers of condos.  So combine that with President Poole’s comment on trucks, as a child of the Cold War, I think it is very ironic that our bailout is coming from the Russians.  [Laughter]  On the employment front, the demand for workers in sectors such as hospitality and energy remains quite strong, but overall plans appear to be more cautious.  The trend in regional labor data mirrors the slowing trend in the national statistics. Each FOMC round my staff provides a summary sentiment index of expected economic conditions over the next six months based on responses of directors and contacts.  Relative to the October meeting, that index is little changed, with the majority expecting flat or slower growth. When I combine the somewhat, but not dramatically, worse data inputs since the last meeting with the anecdotal and survey information from regional and other markets, I’m left with a view that economic fundamentals, current and prospective, have not yet fallen off a cliff.  That being said, there’s not much of a case to be made for any risk assessment other than one weighted to the downside.  In my view, the potential for protracted and growing financial market troubles should weigh heavily in the policy decision, and though recent core inflation readings are acceptable, I continue to be concerned about the ongoing divergence between headline and core inflation.  Until they converge, price pressures cannot be removed from the watch list.  But overall I see more uncertainty and, therefore, more downside risk in the real economic growth picture.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"421";"MR. MISHKIN.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Talk for yourself, Bill.  [Laughter],   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You are all aware that I have a very optimistic personality; and at the last FOMC meeting, I actually had that kind of optimism.  I felt that the economy was evolving in a quite reasonable way and, in fact, was responding to our policy changes in a way that I felt was very appropriate in order to minimize the cost of the financial destruction that we’re experiencing.  In particular, with the credit markets stabilized, we were in a situation in which our policy moves had reduced a lot of the macroeconomic risk that was out there in terms of credit spreads.  Clearly we were still left with the opaqueness spreads or valuation risks that would require price discovery to resolve.  It looked as though that was going to progress very slowly and over time we’d get out of the situation we were in and the economy would go through a solid rebalancing, moving away from some sectors that had too much going on—that is, housing—to sectors which we needed to expand—for example, the tradable sector—to deal with some of the global imbalances that we had.  So I was actually feeling very positive.  I felt that things were going exactly the way that I had hoped. Of course, things don’t always work out that way, and we started to see shortly after the October meeting a substantial deterioration in credit markets.  My view is that the deterioration that we’re seeing is appropriately reflected in the substantial revision to the forecast.  I’m very comfortable with the way the staff has revised the forecast downward.  It’s obviously something that is an art because you have to do it in terms of add factors, but you do want to inform it by science, and I think they have appropriately done so in terms of thinking about what we’ve learned from past experiences that may tell us about how credit disruptions of this type will actually lead to lower spending in many categories. But I want to talk about why my sunny disposition is much less sunny right now and why I’m actually very, very worried—not to say depressed, but at least a little more that way than usual. It is because I think that the kind of negative scenarios that are pointed out in the Greenbook are very real possibilities.  In particular, there are two scenarios that they go into separately—the housing correction scenario and the credit crunch scenario.  I think that there’s a very strong possibility those would come together because, if housing prices go down more, that creates a much more serious problem in terms of valuation risk, and a serious problem in valuation risk will mean a further credit market disruption, which then can lead to more macroeconomic risk because it leads to this downward spiral.  The real economy gets worse.  That means that there is more uncertainty. Credit spreads get worse, and you get a very bad scenario happening.  That could lead to the credit crunch scenario.  Similarly, a credit crunch scenario, I think, would have a very negative effect on the real economy, which would mean that housing prices would go down, which would then make it much more likely that we have the greater housing correction scenario.  So that’s the first part of my depression. The second issue is that the Greenbook does not go into the issue of what effect that might have overseas.  There has been a lot of discussion in the media about decoupling the U.S. economy from foreign economies, and when it’s just trade that’s going on, I think that is usually completely reasonable.  But when it’s financial, then there is very good reason to think of recoupling because a financial disruption in the United States is very likely to spread to financial disruption abroad.  We, of course, have already seen that.  It’s remarkable that what happened in the subprime sector has in some sectors affected European banks maybe even more than American banks.  So the possibility that problems develop in the United States and lead to problems in Europe and other advanced countries and then those problems actually spill over back into the United States again means that there’s a third scenario that could be all tied together. When you look at all of this, I get very nervous.  The bottom line is that my modal forecast is certainly down, very much along the lines of what the staff has suggested.  But I think there is a significant probability that things will go south.  You don’t like to use the R word, but the probability of recession is, I think, nearing 50 percent, and that really worries me very much.  I also think that there’s even a possibility that a recession could be reasonably severe, though not a disaster.  Luckily all of this has happened with an economy that was pretty strong and with banks having good balance sheets; otherwise it could really be a potential disaster.  I don’t see that, but I do see that there is substantial risk that the economy could have a severely negative hit to it that would be very, very problematic. Now, when I look at the issue of inflation, I have a different view from many of the people at this table.  I feel strongly that the one thing a central bank can never afford to do is to lose its nominal anchor.  If we do that, it’s a disaster.  With that viewpoint, I should say that, if shocks occurred such that recession was going to occur and the only way we could stop a recession from occurring was to inflate the economy, we couldn’t allow that to happen.  We actually have to preserve the nominal anchor because, in the long run, the pursuit of price stability is what makes good monetary policy and has been a key reason for the remarkable success of monetary policy by the central bankers throughout the world in recent years that I think nobody would have predicted. But when I look at what’s going on in terms of inflation right now, I really do not see the substantial upside risk that a lot of people are talking about.  For me the key driver of inflation is, as you know, inflation expectations.  The question is whether inflation expectations are grounded, and I think the answer is “yes.”  In fact, we’ve had a situation in which higher energy prices have not led to any upward movement in expected inflation as far as I can tell.  Neither has the dollar declined—that actually happened when the economy was doing much better. Now we’re facing a situation in which we have some substantial negative shocks to the economy, and those substantial negative shocks actually, if anything, put some downside risk in terms of inflation.  I don’t see that inflation will move much from 2 percent.  One thing that has happened recently is that we have not seen some of the favorable inflation numbers.  President Plosser talked about the fact that we’ve seen less favorable inflation numbers, but that’s because we had temporary factors that were going to make inflation look overly good and drive it below 2 percent.  The staff strongly indicated to us in the Greenbook and in past Greenbooks that those temporary factors were not going to persist.  They got that one right, but there’s no information from the fact that those temporary factors are no longer present that says that inflation pressures have actually heated up.  Indeed, what we see is that inflation seems to be moving around 2 percent. That’s where I think inflation expectations are grounded, and I see no tendency at all for things to get much worse in that regard.  I’m not saying that couldn’t change, and so I think we have to be very vigilant.  But in the current environment, where I see a very negative potential path of the economy, the idea that inflation is our primary concern right now is not where I am.  With that let me end."
"422";"MR. PLOSSER.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  There has been little change in the economic conditions in our District since the October meeting.  Except for housing activity, manufacturing and other businesses are expanding at a modest pace, somewhat below trend.  Our business contacts are a little less optimistic about growth in the near term than they were earlier in the fall primarily because of uncertainty surrounding the outlook rather than any immediate change in their business activity.  I’ll begin by reporting on what our contacts say about credit conditions.  Business contacts as well as our board of directors have told me that credit activity has changed very little. Creditworthy borrowers, as far as they were concerned, have had no problem accessing credit. Banks have reported some tightening of lending standards, but mostly that has occurred for real estate developers and in residential mortgages.  Some loan demand has dropped because of businesses’ uncertainty about the future, as I suggested earlier.  That is, businesses seem to be a bit more cautious.  But banks do not appear to be conserving capital.  In fact, they’re actively seeking good credits.  To quote one of my directors, “The crunch on Wall Street has not hit Main Street.”  A couple of bankers I spoke to, one representing a very large regional bank and another a very large community bank, expressed the view that they were actively seeking to regain market share from the larger banks because they did not engage in the same off-balance-sheet financing of riskier debt that the large banks did and so they were not facing either capital or funding constraints.  Some bankers acknowledge that consumer credit quality seems to have deteriorated slightly, but they reminded me that this was from very good levels.  So the defaults and delinquencies remain well within historical norms. Turning to the economy, payroll employment continues to expand at a somewhat slow pace in our three states, yet the unemployment rate is still 0.4 percentage point below that of the nation. Retail sales picked up in November.  Moreover, retailers generally said they met their expectations for the Thanksgiving weekend.  However, these sales seem to have been boosted by fairly heavy discounting, according to them; and despite the reasonable showing to date, retailers are wary and uncertain for the holiday season.  Housing construction and sales continue to decline, but the pace of that decline is in line with the expectations at the time of our last meeting.  Nonresidential real estate markets remain firm in our District.  Office vacancy rates continue to decline, and commercial rents are rising.  New contracts for commercial real estate have declined, however; but with the decline in vacancy rates and with rising rents, the outlook of many developers is not as negative as the current level of spending would suggest.  According to our Business Outlook Survey, manufacturing activity in the District has been increasing at a modest pace for the past few months.  The index of general activity moved up slightly, to 8.2 in November from 6.8 in October.  This is actually about the same average level that the outlook survey has maintained over the past two years.  Shipments and new orders moved up slightly.  However, optimism regarding the outlook over the next six months declined.  It’s a common theme of many of our business contacts that their businesses have not changed much, but they seem to be reacting to the steady stream of negative news, and it is affecting their outlook.  Indeed, the CEOs of several very large industrial firms in our District report business to be very strong both domestically and overseas, and the CEOs have seen little effect of the turmoil on Wall Street on their ability to obtain credit. Now, last time I said that there had been little change in the District’s inflation picture. However, we have started to see evidence of increased price pressures.  The Business Outlook Survey’s prices-paid index has risen considerably since the beginning of the year and has doubled since August.  The index for prices received has also more than doubled since August, rising sharply in both October and November.  Also retailers have noted spreading price increases for imported goods, and a wide range of industries are reporting increases in energy and transportation costs.  Firms continue to report higher health care costs, and at the same time, wages continue to be moderate, they say. In summary, economic conditions have changed little since our last meeting.  The business activity in the region is advancing at a moderate pace.  Credit constraints experienced by the large money center banks have not appreciably affected the banks in our District or their lending practices.  In general, firms in the District remain cautiously optimistic about their businesses six months from now but not so much as they were last month.  Price pressures have increased on the input side related to energy and commodity costs; more generally, many firms are now prepared to raise their own prices and are looking to do so in the near future, and the financial conditions of our banks remain good. Turning to the nation, financial market conditions, especially those associated with the big money center banks, have clearly deteriorated in recent weeks.  Until the end of October, spreads were gradually declining.  It seems that the potential for a serious meltdown was monotonically declining.  However, since early November, as we all pointed to, a number of financial institutions, subprime mortgages, jumbo mortgages, asset-backed commercial paper, below-investment-grade bonds, and LIBOR have experienced increased spreads.  Volatility has risen as well.  Clearly, risk premiums have risen for certain classes of assets, and investors have fresh concerns about the way credit market conditions are evolving.  Overall, the recent financial developments suggest that it will take longer before conditions are “back to normal” in all segments of the market.  As I’ve said before, I continue to believe that price discovery still plagues many of these markets.  It now looks as though it will take a little longer before these markets can sort things out and return to normal. Financial institutions continue to write off some of the investments and take losses.  I view these write-downs as a necessary and healthy part of the process toward stabilization.  Infusions of capital in some financial institutions, I think, are encouraging and helpful to the process.  This does not mean that the ultimate agreed-upon market prices for some of these assets will bear any resemblance to what they did before August.  Indeed, they probably won’t.  But that’s not necessarily a bad sign, nor is it a cause for concern.  In general, it may be a very healthy development. The news on economic activity has softened somewhat since our last meeting.  Among the negatives, of course, the housing market and residential investment continue to decline. Foreclosures have continued to grow at unprecedented rates.  Firms have become a little more cautious in their investment plans.  Consumer spending has softened slightly, and real disposable personal income declined in October.  Oil prices have moved higher.  On the brighter side so far, there is some evidence of spillovers from the financial and housing markets to the broader economy, but I believe it is limited.  Net exports and business fixed investment have been surprises on the upside.  Finally, and most important, the labor market still looks pretty solid.  Foreclosures and consumer weaknesses appear to be heavily concentrated in those states where the housing boom and thus the housing price declines have been most pronounced—especially California, Nevada, and Florida—and in those states, such as Ohio and Michigan, that are feeling the effects of the decline in automobile manufacturing.  As President Poole indicated, credit card delinquencies were up but highly concentrated in California, Nevada, and Florida.  Thus, based on such observations and the news that I hear from my District, I sense that the stresses in the economy vary significantly by region, and we must be mindful that the weaknesses on Wall Street are in those states that have exaggerated housing volatility and may not be representative of the rest of the economy.  To be sure, we must be wary of continued deterioration and spillovers, but at this point my assessment is that they remain concentrated in a few regions and are not as widespread as some of the aggregate data might suggest. It’s important to note that, for a good part of the forecast for the fourth-quarter GDP, it’s payback for strong inventories and net export numbers in the third quarter.  I note that, absent payback and despite the worsening news, economic growth would be on the order of 2 percent higher.  To put this differently, the news since the last meeting has not altered the overall GDP forecast for the second half of 2007.  It’s about the same.  The news has clearly altered the Greenbook’s forecast for 2008, especially for the first half of the year but also extending into the second half of 2008.  The forecast calls for explicit spillovers from financial markets and the housing sector to the broader economy, to consumption, to fixed investment, and so forth.  I should note, however, that most private sector forecasters are significantly less pessimistic than the Greenbook.  The Blue Chip survey, our just-released Livingston Survey, our Survey of Professional Forecasters, and several of the major forecasting firms that have issued forecasts in the last couple of weeks see weakness extending into the first and maybe the second quarter of 2008 but a much more rapid bounceback in the second half of 2008 than is suggested in the Greenbook.  These private sector forecasts are more in line with my own view. While the news on growth is somewhat on the downside, the news on inflation is on the upside.  Readings on core inflation have been stable over the last few months, but headline inflation rates have risen sharply, with increases in energy and commodity prices.  The broader scope of these commodity price increases and their breadth suggest that perhaps there are more-generalized inflationary pressures out there rather than these isolated relative price shocks.  I will note that the core PCE inflation rate for March to June was 1½ percent; and in every three-month window subsequently, the inflation rate has risen monotonically, now reaching 2.26 percent for the latest three-month period from August to October.  This comes after fairly steady declines in core rates during the first half of the year.  In my comments on the Third District, I noted the greater prospects for price increases indicated by our manufacturing firms.  I also am going to cite another statistic from the same survey that President Evans referred to—Duke University’s CFO Magazine survey. The survey to which he referred was a survey conducted in late November and early December of more than 600 CFOs.  In the survey, the average price increase that these CFOs were estimating for their own products in the coming year was 2.8 percent, and that was up from just 2 percent in the previous quarter.  Thus, it appears that firms are beginning to be more interested in increasing prices and are more able to do so than they were just a few months ago, even though the same CFOs were more pessimistic about the economy than they were in the last quarter. Another piece of news on inflation expectations comes from the Livingston Survey, which was just released yesterday.  There the forecast of the average annual change for the CPI for 2007 to 2008 moved up from 2.3 percent to 3 percent.  This, of course, partially reflects the behavior of oil prices during the past several months.  The December-to-December forecast, on the other hand, also rose, but only slightly. Thus, overall, the economy is weak but only slightly more so than I anticipated.  Volatility in the financial markets continues, and the repricing of risk has not progressed as smoothly as I would like to see.  Nevertheless, the spillovers from the financial turmoil seem geographically concentrated, and broader spillovers appear limited to date.  I view inflation expectations as fragile and see evidence that price pressures are growing and that more and more firms feel that price increases are coming and are supportable.  I think we will have to be very careful not to presume that just because price expectations and prices have remained contained that they will continue to be so, independent of our actions.  Thank you."
"423";"MR. POOLE.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just before the meeting I learned something about how we select the order.  There are a bunch of us sitting with Debbie, and most people seem to want to go toward the end.  Debbie apparently has been in touch with too many econometricians because she said it is “overdetermined.” [Laughter]  Anyway, here I am. Let me start with some of the anecdotal reports.  It is pretty clear that the anecdotal reports that I am getting from large national firms on the goods side of the economy are coming in on the soft side.  The holiday season, according to UPS, is coming in about 2 percentage points below projection; and UPS and FedEx are revising down somewhat their longer-term projections and their capital spending plans.  My FedEx contact said that the less-than-truckload business is, in his terms, pitiful.  My contact with a large trucking company, J.B.Hunt, said that the company is cutting its capacity.  Its volume is down 13 percent from a year ago.  The company has reduced capacity 13 percent over the past twelve months and will cut another 12 percent.  That is, after all, a full one-quarter cut in capacity of that company.  Hunt is selling its trucks.  Many of them are going to Russia, interestingly enough.  Perhaps the only good news from this company is that drivers are plentifully available, which has not been so true in the past. In the quick-serve restaurant business, there is a ray of hope.  The projection is that food prices will increase much more modestly than they have been doing this year, but they said that most people in the restaurant business are pessimistic.  On the other hand, a large software company reports that it is optimistic.  The sales of PCs are good, gaming devices and software are doing well, and cap-ex plans are substantial—nothing being cut back there.  A contact with a large money center bank said that the bank’s analysis of its consumer credit card business indicated that the increase in thirty-day delinquencies is entirely explained by what is going on in Florida, California, and Nevada, and delinquencies in the rest of the country are about unchanged. A general comment on the business outlook:  We have a lot of specific news—and certainly Janet talked about some of that—that is pretty negative.  I have an inherent optimism about the economy, which is hard to put any real flesh on the bones I guess, but I think that the economy in the longer run is inherently strong and resilient.  A lot of the adjustments in the credit markets I believe are under way.  We see it with a lot of the recapitalizations that are taking place and the initial shock back in July and August.  There are a lot of smart people with sharp pencils who are digging into their situations, deciding what to write off, and then getting on with things; and they are past the initial scramble.  So those things together give me some sense of optimism.  I would also note that, although many households are certainly stressed, there does seem to be a lot of discretionary spending taking place—consumer electronics, for example, are pretty strong.  There was an article in the newspaper noting that the hot items this Christmas season are GPS navigation devices.  To add one of these to your car hardly seems to be an essential expenditure.  Computer games are another example.,   I bought my GPS a long time ago, and I don’t play computer games.  But at any rate, flat panel TVs, a lot of stuff like that, suggest that many households are not on the edge of being highly stressed.  So I don’t know where to come out on this.  I guess that my outlook has more variance to it than usual, and it seems to me that, when we get to the policy discussion, what we need to do is to find a way to react promptly to the surprises that I think are inevitably ahead of us.  Thank you.,   Well, it is not current production, so it is not an export."
"424";"MR. ROSENGREN.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I took the same pessimism pill as President Yellen this morning.  The Greenbook makes very somber reading, and I would make several observations about the forecast it provides.  First, Greenbook forecasts of two successive quarters of growth below 1 percent are quite rare, and often in the past have occurred shortly before or during recessions.  Second, the 70 percent confidence interval for the Greenbook projection of GDP, using historical forecast errors, has a negative lower bound. Third, I would note that when the unemployment rate rises at least ½ percent, it tends to rise much further than just ½ percent.  That is, historically, when we have unemployment rates rise ½ percent, we have subsequently found ourselves in a recession.  These observations indicate that, while a recession is not forecast in the Greenbook—as David has been careful to state—the probability of a recession is clearly elevated. At our last meeting, the housing market was very soft, but weakness in other components was not yet reflected in the data.  But now we have some evidence that consumption and investment may also be slowing, and residential investment may be even weaker than we thought.  While incoming data have generally been weak, some higher-frequency data, like the recent labor report, might be consistent with a stronger outlook than the Greenbook forecast. However, I am concerned that housing prices may actually fall more than assumed in the Greenbook, potentially resulting in consequences that are difficult to forecast with models using only postwar data.  I am also sympathetic to the view that disruptions in financial flows have the potential to result in significantly more weakness than would result from an econometric model that does not capture significant liquidity disruptions, in part because the occurrence of such events is quite rare.  Added to these concerns is the current state of financial markets both here and abroad.  The elevated rates for term lending, even over relatively short maturities, indicates significant risk aversion by market participants.  Financial institutions with very low probabilities of default, as measured by credit default swap rates, are nonetheless having difficulty securing term lending over year-end. Bank supervisors of large financial institutions are beginning to report correlations in nonperforming experiences of auto, credit card, and mortgage loans.  Geographic regions hard hit by mortgage defaults are also experiencing rising default rates in other types of loans. Portfolios that are not highly correlated during good times can become highly correlated during bad times, and the initial trends being reported in bank supervision are not encouraging.  I would also highlight this as one of the instances in which bank supervision is providing some very relevant input into thinking about the macroeconomy. Finally, I would highlight several institutional concerns that could have broader implications.  First, financial guarantors, as was highlighted earlier, have credit default swap rates inconsistent with their AAA rating.  Significant downgrades would further depress CDOs but also disrupt the municipal bond market and force some banks to fulfill agreements to purchase securities that do not maintain at least an AA rating.  Second, there is the potential for significant further announcements of downgrades of assets related to SIVs and CDOs.  Money market funds are currently experiencing inflows.  However, those flows could quickly reverse if investors lose confidence in their ability to redeem money market funds at par.  Third, I would note that for securities like lower-grade bonds that have not previously shown elevated risk premiums, those premiums are now becoming quite elevated, providing evidence that what was initially a liquidity concern is now becoming a more widespread and generalized concern about the state of the economy. With core inflation a little below 2 percent, and future reductions in labor market pressures likely, we have the flexibility to respond aggressively to slowing economic growth and the ongoing financial turmoil.  This seems to be the appropriate time to take significant further action, knowing that, should the economy perform much better than we currently anticipate, we could be equally nimble in raising rates as appropriate."
"425";"MR. STERN.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It probably goes without saying that I think the main development since the last FOMC meting has been the renewed deterioration in some of the financial markets.  In the absence of that—that is, had financial market conditions either stabilized or continued to improve as they had from the September to October meetings—we would be probably having a somewhat different conversation this morning.  We would be talking more about parsing the recent incoming macro data and talking about whether the economy was slowing as anticipated or a little more or a little less.  We should remember, we were expecting a significant slowing in the rate of growth, and that in fact does seem to be occurring.  But, as I said, I think the financial market developments have been the dominant ones. As far as the economic outlook is concerned, my view of the next few quarters is for growth a bit better than that in the Greenbook for a couple of reasons.  One is that I think the incoming data, as always, are noisy, and I am reluctant to put a lot of weight on them.  Second, it seems to me that some of the underlying fundamentals, particularly the labor market data, present a more favorable picture of the outlook than the spending numbers at the moment.  But it seems to me that the risks are clearly on the downside, and they are on the downside because of financial market conditions.  Perhaps the most interesting anecdote I came across in the intermeeting period was that about two weeks ago we had a meeting with about fifteen leaders from firms in the financial services industry in the Twin Cities.  There was a good deal of concern among, I would say, virtually all the participants in that meeting, and it wasn’t so much about year-end funding and that kind of thing.  It was really about the economic outlook, and it had to do with the fact that some markets are not working or are barely working at the moment. There is no doubt that in their own businesses they are all tightening terms and other conditions. They believe that is appropriate, but they wouldn’t argue that it isn’t going to have an effect on spending.  They also believe that at least some of their customers are acting in anticipation of that.  That is, they are starting to cancel or at least delay spending plans, believing that they aren’t going to be able to find financing or at least find financing at terms they would like.  So it seems to me that we are in an environment, as far as financial conditions are concerned, where that poses a very real downside threat to what otherwise might be a pretty acceptable economic outlook. Just a word about inflation.  I haven’t changed my outlook for inflation going forward.  I don’t have a sense from the incoming information that there is any compelling reason at the moment to do so.  Thank you."
"426";"MR. WARSH.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many of you, I think that the risks of bad economic outcomes are higher than they were when we met in October, both here in the United States and among our trading partners.  The profound deterioration in financial markets—which in my view has changed significantly, more so than the data on the real economy—as been much discussed already.  I’ll make two separate observations about that deterioration now versus on the darkest days in August or September.  First, we’re seeing a very meaningful preference for Treasuries as opposed to agencies.  In our discussions and in the data several months ago, they would have tended to be bundled together, but are putting more pressure on Treasuries in this current environment.  Second, it strikes me that more overnight funding is being done by more large financial institutions, and that has to concern us as we talk in the next round about policy.  Liquidity conditions have been hurt by several related factors, most of which speak to a lack of confidence. Certainly there are lower expectations about the macroeconomic environment and a lack of confidence in counterparties and in funding through year-end; but perhaps mostly, the escalating risk aversion within the four walls of most, but not all, very large financial institutions has caused this market turmoil, both in the formal banking system and in what President Yellen described as the shadow banking system. So why have these institutions lost faith and so much conviction?  I’ll give a few reasons. First, senior management instability.  Second, a lack of confidence—by boards, senior managers who are still around, and the rest of their people—in the risk-management systems.  There is a growing chasm of confidence between the boards—and those who are around them—about their stress tests and about their ability to withstand a series of shocks that could lead to further deterioration.  There is also a very bad risk-reward tradeoff for those who are prepared or have been given some ability to put balance sheet capital to work.  If they make a bet and it turns out to be very bad in this environment, their jobs and the jobs of many of their peers will be over.  If they make a bet and it turns out to be as good as they expect, they won’t be keeping much of the fruits of that trade.  As a result, I think we are finding that key people across institutions—which President Fisher and others talked about as keen to provide opportunistic capital—have stepped back, I would say materially.  Finally, it’s not year-end pressures with respect to balance sheets that strike me as having the biggest effect here.  It’s that, as these managers are looking at their businesses for 2008, they’re fundamentally having to ask themselves the questions about what businesses they are really in—whether they all should be originators, distributors, and holders of credit and risk or whether they need to go back to where they were five or six years ago, when they were picking their comparative advantages.  As they look at the budgets for next year, I think they have a lot of understanding of what their cost structures are if they don’t change their personnel, but they have very little clarity about what their top-line revenue will be.  That has led to some serious questions about putting capital to work when you’re really not sure what your core businesses are.  I expect that process not to be completed in weeks or months but really in quarters, and it’s for that reason, among others—as Governor Kohn referenced—that I expect this period of relative strain to last for a while. Let me raise a question that I asked at the last FOMC meeting.  Are we seeing merely a change in the competitive landscape or a fundamental weakening across classes of financial institutions?  I would say that today most large financial institutions, both money center commercial banks and large investment banks, are on the sidelines to some meaningful extent—unable or unwilling to put their balance sheets with any real force to work on new capital or on new projects. They’re likely to be stuck there for a while.  Surely there are a few large institutions with both capital and conviction that are opportunistically deploying capital with extremely compelling equity risk premiums.  I think about that more as cherry-picking than any interest or ability of these institutions to buy the entire orchard.  So they will be survivors, but they are being very, very careful. Is there enough opportunistic credit from those institutions that distinguish themselves, along with classes of other institutions that we talked about today—large foreign banks, U.S. branches, super-regional banks, mid-sized banks, community banks, credit units, the GSEs, the Home Loan Banks—to pick up market share and take advantage of that slack that’s been left for a period?  I think in a word the answer is “no.”  That is, they will inevitably pick up some market share during this period.  This is good news for the institutions that had been crowded out by the money center banks invading some of these regions.  But as I look at their own conviction, at their own balance sheets, and importantly, at where their source of credit might come from—from these same capital markets that are in dysfunction—I get encouraged that they can pick up some of the slack, but I wouldn’t expect them to be able to pick up enough for us to avoid the spillover effect to the real economy.  It is true that many of these institutions now find business and new loans to be on better terms.  They’re price leaders rather than price takers.  There is less competition for some of these new C&I loans and some of these new consumer loans.  This is a good thing, but again, I wouldn’t overemphasize that they are somehow going to be able to pick up the slack. What about other forms of opportunistic capital, like sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds that are playing an important role in re-liquefying large banks?  Again, I see that as part of a solution, but in my view, we’re really still early in that process, and most of those institutions that are out looking for capital are likely to get more rounds of capital in the coming weeks, months, and quarters.  The terms of the investment by some of these external funds suggest that this is not the final fund raising but really one of the first.  In some ways, this is a much trickier position than if we saw one class of financial institutions that was weaker and thought that others could fill in.  Again, the provision of credit normally made possible in this environment by the structured finance markets is affecting all financial intermediaries—the weak, the strong, the regulated, the unregulated, those on Wall Street, and those in other cities. So what does the immediate future hold?  Let me spend a moment breaking down a few classes of these institutions.  Investment banks first.  I expect most of them to be on the sidelines for a while.  I expect the 2008 budgets, which are still coming together now, to likely suggest that they are exiting from some businesses and firing employees in larger numbers than markets expect right now.  What about large money center commercial banks, particularly those that have been in the headlines?  Obviously I would expect them, with some leadership clarity, to take a direction, but these businesses take a very long time to turn.  So what will they do?  They will continue to prune their balance sheets, continue to sell noncore assets and businesses, continue raising capital, and continue their discussions with rating agencies about meeting rating agencies’ expectations.  These rating agencies want to be observers.  They no longer want to be market makers or market participants, but I suspect they’re going to find a reversion to the role of some years ago hard to pull off in this environment.  What about super-regionals and community banks, which many of you spoke about with some view that their current balance sheets look okay?  I think there is a sense of foreboding in that group about their commercial real estate exposures.  Even though they are largely open for business, we shouldn’t overstate their ability to pick up some slack.  After all, the secondary market is closed for many of them.  Their portfolio lending is up.  The credit line utilizations are being fully tapped.  Their own profit projections are likely to be coming down over 2008, and even though they certainly want to increase market share, they’re reading the same headlines, and my own judgment is they’re likely to be still somewhat worried. In sum, these problems appear to me to have been long in the making—long before they struck the housing markets—and will be somewhat longer in the rebound than we might have thought even some weeks ago.  The catalysts for improvement, though, are manifold.  First, new leaders with dispassionate views are coming to many of these financial institutions and are willing to sell assets at prices that the leaders who brought them into different businesses might have been unwilling to do.  Again, it strikes me that the ability to sell an entire book of business at a fixed dollar amount and run a competitive auction might help clear many of these prices that have otherwise looked pretty stubborn and pretty hard to mark.  In terms of other validators that might be coming into these new investments, as I mentioned, I think the raising of equity funds is encouraging, but these validators, particularly those in the United States and some in sovereign wealth funds elsewhere, are pretty patient, and I don’t see any of them thinking that they need to deploy their capital quickly or on terms with which they are uncomfortable because they will have an opportunity to look at tens and dozens more term sheets in the next several quarters.  As many of them are making investments now, they have a range of term sheets in front of them, and that judgment won’t be rushed in their view.  So the idea that it would be a panacea for the real economy strikes me as a bit overstated in the current environment. So what about the real economy?  No doubt the turmoil in financial markets, some of which was self-inflicted, has the potential to do more harm to the broader economy in the fourth quarter and in early next year.  But we have to be humble about our understanding of that transmission mechanism.  The preceding discussion strikes me as giving less comfort than I had at the last FOMC meeting on the short-term resilience and dynamism of our financial markets to repair themselves quickly.  I’m still very optimistic over the forecast period and the medium term, but it puts more of a burden on the resilience and dynamism of our labor markets and more of a focus on the resilience and dynamism of our product markets and of our businesses.  They do appear to be holding up okay.  In my view, if you look at the various surveys that were referenced earlier today and the Business Roundtable survey of CEOs, these would be much more dire forecasts if we were in recession now than they appear to be at this moment.  Most of these CEOs, who are not great at calling inflection points, still think that their business is okay.  The economy has slowed; it is riskier; but it strikes me that we have a good shot of being able to follow through on the pattern outlined in the Greenbook. Finally, just let me make a quick note about inflation risks.  I think the inflation risks have garnered certainly less of my attention in this intermeeting period and might have garnered even somewhat less of the discussion around this table.  The inflation risks that we saw six weeks ago strike me as not having improved very much.  Inflation risks are quite real, and so as we are choosing our policy options, we have to keep these in mind.  But we obviously have to take the shorter-term risks and the illiquidity in the markets into account first and foremost as we think about both monetary policy and liquidity policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"427";"MS. PIANALTO.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The conversations that I have had with my business contacts indicate that business conditions in our region have clearly softened since the last meeting and perhaps even more than what is reflected in the Beige Book report that we prepared just a few weeks ago.  A sense of pessimism about the economic outlook seems once again to be sweeping over our business community, and it is not just the financial community. This is a decided change from what I was hearing in October and is clearly an added threat to our already fragile outlook.  My banking supervision staff reports that the District banks continue to address the risks in their portfolios by shifting focus away from residential and commercial real estate and by requiring more collateral, stronger covenants, and better debt-service coverage in their deals.  But our examiners are not reporting that capital positions of our financial institutions have been impaired such that they cannot accommodate sound projects.  A few of the corporate CFOs I talk with say that credit commitments are more difficult to come by.  The CEOs of the Fourth District financial institutions advise me that what we are facing is a liquidity squeeze and not at present a credit crunch.  That said, these bank CEOs have expressed concern that their capital positions could become impaired if the current pressure for more liquidity forces them to sell some of their assets at large discounts. The incoming data for the economy appear to be unfolding reasonably close to my October projection.  I was fairly pessimistic about our near-term growth prospects, and that pessimism seems to have been well founded.  So the economic data by themselves haven’t been enough to push me off the forecast trajectory that I submitted at our last meeting.  But as I noted earlier, I do observe a sharp drop in business confidence across a broad collection of industries, not just those tied to residential real estate.  What I am hearing sounds more substantial than the transitory slowing that I was projecting just six weeks ago.  What I am hearing from my business contacts is probably more aligned with the prolonged slow growth outlook that I now see in the Greenbook baseline, or worse.  I am somewhat thankful that I didn’t have to submit a projection for this meeting because I am torn between what my mostly data-driven model says and what I am hearing from my business sources.  About the only thing that I can say with much confidence is that the reemergence of liquidity pressures, combined with the deterioration in business confidence, has increased the downside risk to growth.  I think it is prudent to address that risk with our policy decision today, but I will hold my comments about our policy moves for later in the meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"428";"MS. YELLEN.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the time of our last meeting, I held out hope that the financial turmoil would gradually ebb and the economy might escape without serious damage.  Subsequent developments have severely shaken that belief.  The bad news since our last meeting has grown steadier and louder, as strains in financial markets have resurfaced and intensified and as the economy has shown clear signs of faltering.  In addition, the downside threats to growth that then seemed to be tail events now appear to be much closer to the center of the distribution.  I found little to console me in the Greenbook.  Like the Board staff, I have significantly marked down my growth forecast.  The possibilities of a credit crunch developing and of the economy slipping into a recession seem all too real. Conditions in financial markets have worsened.  Rates on a wide array of loans and securities have increased significantly since our last meeting, including those on term commercial paper, term LIBOR, prime jumbo mortgages, and high-yield corporate bonds.  CDS spreads from major financial institutions with significant mortgage exposure, including Freddie and Fannie, have risen appreciably.  In addition, broad stock indexes are down nearly 5 percent. At the same time, measures of implied volatility in equity, bond, and foreign exchange markets have all moved up, reflecting the greater uncertainty about the economy’s direction. The most recent data on spending have been discouraging as well.  Data on house sales, prices, and construction have been downbeat, and foreclosures on subprime loans have moved even higher.  Even with efforts such as those facilitated by the Administration to freeze subprime rates, foreclosures look to rise sharply next year, which may dump a large number of houses on a market already swamped with supply.  This will exacerbate the downward pressure on house prices and new home construction from already elevated home inventories.  Indeed, the ten-city Case-Shiller home-price index has declined more than 5 percent over the past year through September, and futures contracts point to another sizable decline over the next twelve months. I am particularly concerned that we may now be seeing the first signs of spillovers from the housing and financial sectors to the broader economy.  Although the job market has remained reasonably healthy so far, real consumer spending in September and October was dead in the water, and households are growing more pessimistic about future prospects.  The December reading of consumer sentiment showed another decline, and the cumulative falloff in this measure is becoming alarming.  Gains in disposable income have been weakened.  With consumer sentiment in the doldrums, house prices on the skids, and energy prices on the rise, consumer spending looks to be quite subdued for some time.  This view is echoed by the CEO of a national high-end clothing retailer on our board, who recently emphasized to us that the positive chain store sales data in November were in fact artificially boosted by the Thanksgiving calendar shift and that the underlying trend for his business has worsened notably. My modal forecast foresees the economy barely managing to avoid recession, with growth essentially zero this quarter and about 1 percent next quarter.  I expect growth to remain below potential throughout next year, causing the unemployment rate to rise to about 5 percent, much like in the Greenbook.  This forecast assumes a 50 basis point decline in the federal funds rate in the near future, placing the real funds rate near the center of the range of estimates of the neutral rate reported in the Bluebook.  I should emphasize that I do not place a lot of confidence in this forecast, and, in particular, I fear that we are in danger of sliding into a credit crunch. Such an outcome is illustrated by the credit crunch alternative simulation in the Greenbook. Although I don’t foresee conditions in the banking sector getting as bleak as during the credit crunch of the early 1990s, the parallels to those events are striking.  Back then, we saw a large number of bank failures in the contraction of the savings and loan sector.  In the current situation, most banks are still in pretty good shape.  Instead, it is the shadow banking sector— that is, the set of markets in which a variety of securitized assets are financed by the issuance of commercial paper—that is where the failures have occurred.  This sector is all but shut for new business. But bank capital is also an issue.  Until the securitization of nonconforming mortgage lending reemerges, financing will depend on the willingness and ability of banks, thrifts, and the GSEs to step in to fill the breach.  To the extent they do, that will put further pressure on their capital, which is already under some pressure from write-downs on existing loans and holdings of assets.  Banks are showing increasing concern that their capital ratios will become binding and are tightening credit terms and conditions.  Several developments suggest to me that this situation could worsen.  In addition to the problems plaguing the adjustable-rate subprime mortgages, delinquencies have recently started to move up more broadly—on credit card and auto loans, adjustable-rate prime mortgages, and fixed-rate subprime mortgages.  My contacts at large District banks tell me that, because the economy continues to be reasonably healthy and people have jobs, things are still under control.  But if house prices and the stock market fall further and the economy appears to be weakening, then they will further tighten the lending conditions and terms on consumer loans to avoid problems down the road, and these fears could be self-fulfilling.  If banks only partially replace the collapsed shadow banks or, worse, if they cut back their lending in anticipation of a worsening economy, then the resulting credit crunch could push us into recession.  This possibility is presumably increasingly reflected in CDS and low-grade corporate bond spreads.  Thus, the risk of recession no longer seems remote, especially since the economy may well already have begun contracting in the current quarter. Indeed, the December Blue Chip consensus puts the odds of a recession at about 40 percent. This estimate is within the range of recession probabilities computed by my staff using models based on the yield curve and other variables. Turning to inflation, data on the core measure continues to be favorable.  Wage growth remains moderate, and the recent downward revisions to hourly compensation have relieved some worries there.  Inflation expectations remain contained.  As I mentioned, I expect some labor market slack to develop, and this should offset any, in my view, modest inflationary pressures from past increases in energy and import prices and help keep core PCE price inflation below 2 percent.  Continued increases in energy and import prices pose some upside risk to the inflation outlook, but there are also downside risks to inflation associated with a weakening economy and rising unemployment. To sum up, I believe that the most likely outcome is for the economy to slow significantly in the near term, flirting with recession, and I view the risk to that scenario as being weighted significantly to the downside.  In contrast, I expect inflation to remain well contained, and I view those risks as fairly balanced."
"429";"VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.";"FOMC20071211meeting.csv";"  Thank you.  The outlook for real activity has deteriorated somewhat since our last meeting.  In our modal forecast we now expect several quarters of growth below potential with real GDP for ’08 a bit above 2 percent.  The sources of the deterioration in the outlook for us are pretty much as outlined in the Greenbook.  What separates us from the Greenbook still is about 40 or 50 basis points of different views on what potential growth is.  Our view of the likely path of the output gap is similar.  So as in the Greenbook, we expect a deeper contraction in housing activity and prices.  We expect nominal and real income growth to slow more than we expected and consumer spending also to moderate more than we had anticipated.  Part of that lower path of real spending is, of course, due to energy prices.  We also expect the rate of growth in business fixed investment to slow a bit more than we had previously thought, and these changes are in part, but not solely, due to the expected effects of tighter financial conditions.  For a given path of the nominal fed funds rate, they are tighter now than they otherwise would have been because of the fall in the estimated neutral rate.  In our view, growth in the rest of the world will slow a bit, but along with the effects of the decline in the dollar, it will still provide enough pull for net exports to contribute positively to growth, offsetting part of, but just part of, the deceleration in domestic demand growth.  Our forecast for core inflation is little changed.  We expect the core PCE deflator to rise at a rate just under 2 percent over the forecast period. Like many of you, we see considerable downside risks to the forecast for growth, and they have intensified since our last meeting.  The Greenbook alternative scenarios on housing and the credit crunch seem plausible, perhaps more likely to happen together than to happen independently, and I think reality is likely to fall somewhere between the baseline Greenbook scenario and these two darker alternatives.  The risk to the inflation forecast still seems closer to balance in the forecast period.  The higher forward curve of energy prices and the lower path of the dollar will raise headline inflation a bit and, in the near term, the core inflation path.  But these pressures should be offset by the fall in anticipated pressure on resource utilization, not just here but also globally where the economies that have been growing above potential are likely to slow as monetary policy tightens. I think it’s important to recognize that breakevens in inflation at longer horizons have stayed relatively stable in the context of the fairly substantial move in the dollar, the fairly substantial move in actual and expected energy and commodity prices, and the very dramatic change in expectations of how the Fed is likely to respond to the change in the balance of risks to growth.  In light of these changes to the outlook and the risks to the outlook, we’ve lowered our expected path for the fed funds rate.  We now think it’s likely that the Committee will reduce the target rate to 3.75 percent over the next few quarters, and this puts our real and our nominal fed funds rate assumption for ’08 a bit under the new path in the Greenbook.  We’d raise it back in ’09.  But our fed funds rate path is significantly above the market’s estimate.  As you’ve all recognized, conditions in markets have deteriorated substantially since our last meeting, but the basic dynamic is still the same.  Actual and anticipated losses to financial institutions have risen as the prices of a large range of assets have fallen.  Uncertainty over the path of housing prices in the real economy and complexity in valuing assets and structured financial instruments that are most exposed to those risks make it very hard for markets to know with confidence the likely dimension of total losses and who is most exposed to them. Financial institutions have seen a sharp increase in their cost of funds, a substantial shortening in maturities at which they borrow, and a significant reduction in their ability to liquidate or borrow against their assets.  Most banks have seen a very large and unanticipated expansion of their balance sheets as they’ve been forced or have chosen to provide funding in various forms.  As banks and other financial institutions have moved to position themselves to deal with a more adverse economic and financial environment, they have become much more selective in how they use their liquidity and capital.  The consequence of those actions is evident in the sharp increase in the cost of unsecured borrowing and the spreads on secured financing. Now, it’s important to recognize that, although a source of this pressure is concern about macroeconomic risk and its consequence for credit loss and asset values, the consequences of the adjustment by institutions to this new reality are very severe liquidity pressures in markets.  These are particularly acute in Europe, and they are—at least in the market’s expectations—likely to persist well beyond year-end.  These pressures are the symptom of the underlying problem, as fever is the sign of the immune system’s response to an infection.  But just as high fevers can cause organ failure before the infection kills the body, illiquidity itself can threaten market functioning and the economy.  The longer we live with these conditions—large spikes in demand for liquid risk-free assets, a general shortening of funding maturities, a limited amount of available financing even against high-quality collateral, the risk of substantial liquidation of financial assets, and the chances of runs on individual institutions’ funds—the more we are vulnerable to a self-reinforcing adverse spiral that leads to a greater retrenchment in credit supply than fundamentals might otherwise suggest and with a greater effect on growth. I don’t think the past four to six months have been kind to those who have argued that this was just a mild and transitory bump.  As in August, I think we have to be willing to treat both the fever and the infection and, if you step back a second, the appropriate policy response to this set of challenges will entail a mix of measures.  Monetary policy will probably have to be eased further to contain the risk of a more substantial and prolonged contraction in demand growth.  I think we will probably need to continue to adjust our various liquidity instruments.  We may need to encourage some institutions to raise more equity sooner than they otherwise might choose to do.  We need to be very careful to avoid making both types of the classic errors in supervision in financial crises. These are, on the one hand, actions that would amplify the credit crunch by forcing banks to protect their ratios by selling more assets à la New England or, on the other hand, the commission of what you might call irresponsible forbearance à la Japan in the hopes of masking weakness and stretching out the pain.  We also need to be careful to keep thinking through more adverse scenarios for the economy and the financial system and the policy responses that may be appropriate if they materialize. The United States is, I think, a remarkably resilient economy still.  Outside of housing, we don’t have the same imbalance in inventories with the same degree of overinvestment in other parts of the economy that we have had going into past downturns.  Corporate balance sheets still seem relatively healthy.  The world economy is no doubt stronger.  Current account imbalance is coming down.  Our core institutions entered this adjustment period with a fair amount of capital.  It is very encouraging to see so many of them start to raise capital so early.  The financial infrastructure is more robust.  Inflation expectations imply a fair degree of confidence in our ability to keep inflation low over time.  The speed and the extent of the adjustment that we’ve seen in housing and by financial institutions to this new reality are really signs of health, of how well our system works. But we need to be cognizant that the market is torn between two quite plausible scenarios.  In one, we just grow below potential for a given period of time as credit conditions adjust to this new equilibrium; in the other, we have a deep and protracted recession driven as much by financial headwinds as by other fundamentals.  There are good arguments for the former, the more benign scenario, but we need to set policy in a way that reduces the probability of the latter, the more adverse scenario.  Thank you."
