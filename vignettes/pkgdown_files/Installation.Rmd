You can install **keyATM** from either CRAN or GitHub. CRAN has a stable version while GitHub stores the latest version and developing version.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install release version from CRAN (updating keyATM is the same command)
# preparing: install.packages("keyATM")

# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("keyATM/keyATM")
```
