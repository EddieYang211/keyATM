## Which model to use?

The table below summarizes keyATM models and other popular models based on the inputs.

|                                   | Keywords  | Covariate  | Time Structure |

|[keyATM Covariate](keyATM_cov.html)|     ○    |     ○     |        △      |

The next table compares inference methods and speeds. CGS stands for Collapsed Gibbs Sampling and SS stands for Slice Sampling. Variational inference approximates the target distribution, while CGS and SS sample from the exact distribution.

## It takes time to fit the model. What should I do?
Please note that the number of unique words, the total lenght of documents, and the number of topics affect the speed. If you use `cov` model, the number of covariates matters as well, because we need to estimate coefficieitns for covariates.

If you want to speed up fitting, the first thing you can do is to review preprocessing processes. Usually, documents include a lot of low frequency words that do not help interpretation. **quanteda** provides various functions to trim those words.




## How to select keywords?


## How to select the number of regular topics?



## What is the `options` argument?

`keyATM_read()` takes various options.

#### `seed`
This is a seed used to generate random numbers. The same seed is used for initialization and fitting the model (`set.seed()` is executed before both initialization and fitting). If you do not provide `seed`, **keyATM** randomly selects a seed for you.

#### `output_per`



#### `use_weights`
$$
\begin{align}
 a &=   1\\
 b &= 3
\end{align}
$$

#### `visualize_keywords`


#### `thinning`


#### `store_theta`


#### `x_prior`



## Can I run keyATM on cloud computing services?
Yes! For example, [Professor Louis Aslett](http://www.louisaslett.com/) provides an easy to use Amazon Machine Image of RStudio [here](http://www.louisaslett.com/RStudio_AMI/). When you select an instance, please note that **keyATM** does not need multiple cores (one or two cores would be enough because we cannot parallelize Collapsed Gibbs Sampling), but make sure the memory can handle your data.
