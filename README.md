On most machines it's been necessary to drop a recent boost into `/usr/local/include`

## TODO

* Change `phi_s` representation? Currently the only thing not compiling in seeded_train.cpp
* Confirm what's happening in the Z update for X==1
* Complete the X updates
* Run on macavity data
* Add alpha back in
* Confirm posterior works with what we hand back
* Check for user stops in the code
* put the log likelihood calculation back in
