# topicdict

The topic dictionary code, broken out into a separate repository.

(no longer necessary: On most machines it's been necessary to drop a recent boost into `/usr/local/include`)

## TODO

* Complete the X updates
* Put the log likelihood calculation back in
* Add alpha back in
* Check for user stops in the code
* Confirm what's happening in the Z update for X==1
